Deniro is desperate. He knows a few things about himself: that he once had power, that he just isn't interesting enough as a person to transport us now by mere intensity, and that the world of acting is going over to actors that can "fold." 

Folded acting is the ability to present two characters or two layers or perspectives at the same time. The absolutely simplest case is a character with a double personality. So our man commissions a script so he can at least do just that.

If you watch this, you'll have to sit through a whole bunch of setup that is there not for us, but for him. If you are willing to donate an evening to his attempt, be aware that he fails. Along the way, he borrows extensively from Jack's character in "The Shining" down to the helo shot driving to the "cabin."

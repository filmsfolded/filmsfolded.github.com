Gosh. Has anyone jerked us around like Stephen Frears? He's done some amazing stuff, though its odd that everyone has a different favorite. (Mine is "High Fidelity," knowing that "the Grifters" happened.)

All his projects have this notion of two layers of show, in fact, its rather fascinating to go back through the list and see this. "Mrs Henderson Presents" is in much the same tradition, but the trick is of the ordinary kind: a show about a show.

It runs a bit against the template in that the content of the show within doesn't merge with the story of the movie. Instead, it is a sort of 30's model where the film stops and we have the show as a standalone entertainment.

The film is choppy, jumping in intent from one tone to another, and this comment will too.

Dench is a frustrating actress. She plays only one role well, and then only on her terms. But here the fit is nearly perfect (except that bit about losing her son). So if you wanted to see only one Dench film (where she was on screen for longer than 10 minutes), it would be this, I think. She perfect for the role, a sort of cocked head and snipped delivery.

And that's good, because although there's no real movie here, nothing that hangs together and breaths, there is some snappy dialog in places.

But the real reason to see this (if you have time) is the sometimes deft folding. It is of the ordinary kind, but Frears knows his camera well. So you'll often have nice overlaps between stage show and movie.

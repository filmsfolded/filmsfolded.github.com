Wondering again about sex and horror, I dove into three examples, as varied as I could find. 

This one surprised. I usually look for losing myself in the cinematically specific narrative. Its where the experience is to be found, you know.

But sometimes the writing by itself is enough. This writing is tight, effective. It reminds me that good writing is rare. If these are the guys behind "Crank," then I guess I need to check it out.

Interestingly, the fabric of the writing has nothing to do with either sex or horror. These are just there: an occasional breast and/or body provide a way to denote a nonchalance that used in the story. 

The story hoists a conventional device onto a novel shelf. The reference is the detective story where the viewer is presented with a corpse and we have to -- by clues -- figure out what happened. It is an amazingly effective and flexible narrative approach, but as it turns out many viewers are lazy and don't want to play the game. So we watch on-screen detectives do all the work and please us with the answers, provided at the "back of the book." 

In this case, the mysteries themselves are incidental, two characters involved in a contest to write mysteries. Incrementally, they become more personally embodied. If it weren't so clever, I'd be complaining about the laziness of viewers. But as it is, I'll celebrate whatever market forces there are that reward clever writers.

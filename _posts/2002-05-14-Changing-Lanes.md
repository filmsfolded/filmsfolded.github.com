Spoilers herein.

A childish morality play. Cardboard characters all, even William Hurt! But that's not remarkable. What is remarkable is the exclusively steadicam presentation. It is wholly artless, a matter of cheapness. This is film, but we'll be seeing more and more of this as digital video becomes more common.

The staging is 'personal,' with a documentary- like stance which is the excuse for the technique. But it allows for the sloppy mechanic to sneak in. We should demand better. Even if the story weren't juvenile, even if it weren't hobbled by the lesser talent of Affleck that poor cinematography would still kill the project.

The one actor who shines is Toni Collette. See her in '8 1/2 Women,' where she manages both a character and an abstraction of a character.

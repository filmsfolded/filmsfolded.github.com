I'm interested in what makes movies work. I'm now acutely aware that success is a quickly moving, random target. Each film both tries and then becomes either an obstacle or a springboard for the films that follow.

Here we have arguably one of the most successful filmmakers of all time: producer, writer, director, actor and composer. And some of his films ring true today. I think there are two dynamics at work. The first is simple: because those silent films are so radically different, we willingly leave much of our world behind when we view it. So we are making a double visit: to the film and to the world of film.

For some, the film doesn't even have to have merit. The journey to another world by mere association is enough.

The second dynamic is more interesting to me. I think "City Lights" worked then, and it works now but for entirely different reasons. It is not that important things have stayed the same so much as that we have reinvented how we respond to things we think are timeless.

That's why this film is interesting. We have Charlie creating a film using all the old values and techniques but in a modern context. And it fails miserably. 

The folding report is simple: It is a performance about a performer with some of the inner performances shown as memories and dreams. One performer (Chaplin) is creating a performer (Calvero) who is creating a performer (Thereza). The performances within as noted follow Ted' s rule of abstraction: they are abstracted from the story as the story is from us. The core one is itself a performance (a music hall show) that makes fun of a performance (an animal act) in the same way the movie makes fun of Chaplin's prior movies.

In other words, Chaplin's manipulation and folding of narrative is up to his normal fine standard, better in some respects because he had so long to work on it.

But the film still fails because he assumes a context, a viewer's receptiveness to a type of exaggeration we won't tolerate in a "new" film.

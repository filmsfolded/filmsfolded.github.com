Spoilers herein.

In many ways, this is a typical Disney film:

--They continue their long term plan of making all their main characters 'ethnic,' as a deliberate strategy for world aftermarket sales.

--They continue to moralize: this decade, it focuses on at-risk fatherless children.

--They continue to defile classic stories: details below.

--They continue their mastery of the exploration of sex in archetypes, here in the feline British mistress of the boat. This part fascinates me: Disney has a higher concentration of researchers in this area than anywhere else outside spooky labs. They chose Emma Thompson's voice and mannerisms and they couldn't have done better: she is a real actress who understands how to exploit this type of sexually-laden role.

But all these transgressions are made up for in the visual presentation. What's new here is that they have mastered the problems of moving the camera. It is striking because the camera-eye does things no physical camera could. This includes highly composited CGI like 'Potter' and 'Clones,' which have to match to a physical shot. To a film enthusiast this is something special and I suspect that the space theme was invented primarily to exploit these techniques.

See it just for that.

As for how 'Treasure Island' was twisted, recall that the original 'bad guys' were Flint's crew: they actually had 'earned' the treasure and were only claiming their own. Trelawney (here Doppler) was an effete, useless member of the upper class whose privileged existence was (to Stevenson) an act of piracy. 

Jim's adventure was the conflict between these two types of honor. That, folks is why the classics work. The first act in the book, with Blind Pew and the black spot on a page of the Bible -- and the mystery of the chest -- was essential to this setup. 

Now see what the writers of this have done: instead of a conflict within Jim among social systems, it is transferred to Long John, who has a simple moral dilemma and makes the 'right' choice. No wonder we are a nation of nitwits when the soul of a great book is dissolved into a simple morality play. (Notice  the framing device of the kid in the beginning: he doesn't have to read -- the book IS the movie.)

Oh well, apart from the visuals and Emma the catwoman we have something else that is a first to my knowledge: the credits group together all the people who created each character. This is an important event, I think, because in different ways all these people are the 'actor team' who create each character. Would like to see something similar for complex actors in 'real' films. We might have several of the beings in Julianne Moore's body credited, for example.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching

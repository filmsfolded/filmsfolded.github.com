I remember when this first came out. It was part of the sweep of outrage that eventually ended the regime.

That was in the day when South Africa tortured prisoners and suspended justice in other ways in the name of fighting terrorism, and the US did not. Seeing it today gives a whole different film experience so far as the story. I'm seeing a lot of these right now... films that are different now than they could have been. More powerful in a way.

There's another haunting experience here. Persis Khambatta plays a secondary role. In a better script (this one is pretty bad) she would be an interesting character. She isn't here. But she sure is beautiful. For those who don't know, she was Miss India ten years earlier. They take their beauty contests very seriously there, and there are now "talent" considerations. It should be no surprise that she is a poor actress. 

But I think she deserved a better life than she got. She played the pretty girl is a few movies. Then had a minor role in Start Trek when it was dying. She was in a car accident which ruined her face. She died of a heart attach at 47, penniless and alone. Seeing her here is sad, adding to the other sadnesses surrounding this tale.

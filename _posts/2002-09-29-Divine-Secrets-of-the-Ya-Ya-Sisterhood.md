Spoilers herein.

My gosh, a film that makes 'Practical Magic' seem good. Cat's eye comments follow *.

This is the story of Teensy a closeted lesbian who bands with fellow girls in a sort of soft core cult. Over the years, she doesn't marry but vicariously sucks life from the three others, leading them all in varying degrees to alcoholism. One of these is irreparably damaged and has a breakdown, so the damage is passed to the daughter a la Shirley MacLain. Teensy redeems herself through 'healing' the child by 'revealing' the breakdown, but hiding the infidelity with the priest. At the end, the daughter is inducted into the cult by Teensy after having been earlier drugged and kidnapped. One leaves the film stunned at the irony of the presumably happy tone of the end.

Teensy inherited a fortune early in life, money originating in the slave trade a gift from the cult's god, Mary. Teensy spends it on three things: a Rolls, grandly supporting Vivi's husband (a failed cotton farmer) after the breakdown, and first class nursing care for the now aging family maid.

*Cat's eye comments result when nothing intelligent can be directly said of a film.

(The implied film-within-the-film is the play about all this that the Bullock character writes.)

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

How many plots are there supposed to be? 3? 10? Anyway, here's one of them in a basic form, the old surrogate lover ploy.

Predictable, almost boring. What's interesting is Uma Thurman. I've seen her be really bad, really ineffective. And a couple times, just perfect (here and in 'Beautiful Girls'). She's a soulmate of Gwyneth Paltrow who suffers from the same inconsistency ('Emma' and 'Shakespeare in Love' as high points). Both are basically unattractive if you look at their features. Both are celebrated as beauties because of how they work the camera when they connect.

What chemistry makes this happen? What's behind sex? Why and how do movies create the images behind modern sex? I dunno, but I can see it working here.

Garofalo isn't great here. She's much better in 'Mystery Men.'

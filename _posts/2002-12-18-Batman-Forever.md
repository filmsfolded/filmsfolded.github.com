Spoilers herein.

I'm into franchises now, because the same property in different hands is a strong lesson in film philosophies. The Alien series is the best example, but the first Star Wars film differed radically as well. Now to Batman.

The Batman story always was a matter of dueling identities: Bruce Wayne's alter ego was a matter of dark pathology rather than say Superman's scrubbed crusader. The subterranean hideout, the night crawler, the unsettled angst, the matter of revenge characterize the work. Tim Burton missed with the first film, and ended up with eyewash pasted on characters, mostly Nicholson. But he made up for in Batman returns: there he had three characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman) living in split worlds, and each of the splits had a physical architecture. Its a pretty good example of folding internal conflict onto an external world for us to see.

Having mastered the problem, Burton moved on and passed the franchise to a decidedly less intelligent team. They completely lacked the ability to invest the conflict in the built environment and fell back on putting it into the story, so turns the environment into Sunday comics. So we have Two-face, who literally wears his duality, and the Riddler who lives in two worlds: that of the film and in the 'between' space of the viewer and the film, where he intends to spoof us with his puzzling magic. (It's the same space similarly used in 'Spy Kids' 'Rocky and Bullwinkle.')

There was also a long story about Bruce's split mind, which gave the excuse to Kidman's role as psychologist. Lot's of haunting conflict both ways, both sides of Bruce using 'Chase' (note the name) 'Meridian' (dividing line) as both lover and analyst. But all that stuff was cut, including establishing shots at the asylum.

The result is two silly villains who don't have a world to live in as did Penguin and Catwoman. We have Kidman cut adrift with only a Jessica Rabbit imitation to work with. (Note: Kidman's natural red hair was made blond so that Carrey could get the red.) None of the three can possibly act under these conditions, though one of them (Kidman) is a fine actor.

One nice architectural feature remains: the Riddler's shaft which is the setting of the entire last act. The designer really had a powerful idea here, and some of it shines through the thuggish direction.

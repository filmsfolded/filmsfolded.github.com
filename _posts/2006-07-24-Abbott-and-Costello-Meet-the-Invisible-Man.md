If you come to this as a simple movie experience, you'll be disappointed. Its all built around a very few well practiced comedic reactions of Costello. Nothing at all like the wonderful rhythm of their "who's on first" routine.

So you're likely to think this a worthless experience.

And yet if you do watch it, you'll experience part of a fascinating evolution in the way movies acknowledge their audience. In a simple drama, it occurs on a sort of stage, separate from us. But that's almost never the case these days. Now there's some sort of "fold" where the audience is incorporated or referenced in the story somehow. This can get pretty sophisticated, but the simple fold is just to have observers in the story.

You can see this in lots of places: the final race in "Cars," a big battle in "Start Wars" in a stadium with spectators. Its a pretty mature vocabulary these days with lots of experiments along the way. Here's one.

In this case, you start with an existing movie, one that is extremely familiar, already a sort of prototype. Just to be safe, they started with two anchors, the original "Invisible Man" and a gaggle of boxing/gangster movies where the promising star has to "take a dive." Each of these is about watching. The boxing of course is a show and the story concerns how much control the audience has over the outcome. The invisible man bit is, well it is centered on what you see and what you can infer from what you partially see.

Now insert two representatives of us, the audience. Its like Mystery Science Theater in a way, but more explicit. Its only incidental that they have a comic persona, the effect would be the same if they were not.

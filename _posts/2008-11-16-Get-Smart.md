The original TeeVee show was a simple triangulation. We had straightahead spy (and the related detective) shows where it was all about inhuman competence. We also had "parody" comedies which poked fun at various identifiable sectors of society. So it was a no-brainer that the original show, or something like it, would appear. It would have a clueless spy. He would have an observer in a potential romance (which is what competence is all about). And week by week, we would chuckle until the idea the got worn out.

But movie dynamics are different than TeeVee. Here, we have different fish to fry. The guy has to get the girl: there has to be enough of a romance for us to grab the shape. This, I think is what failed with the "Avengers" movie. He has to win her. She has to be a worthy prize.

The nostalgia card has to be played for those who can actually have real nostalgia for this. But the more powerful nostalgia dynamic has to be that manufactured nostalgia for younger audiences that posits a world they have to be convinced existed. So that they can have a sort of false memory and as they chuckle believe they become wiser.

Did this succeed in that? Yes, I think it did. I think this is a new post-postmodern goal in Hollywood film-making. Its not that they lack ideas and have to rely on old comics and TeeVee. Its a deeper sort of subtle engineering.

I'm not one who believes in vast conspiracies, or even tiny ones. But I think that reflexively and intuitively Hollywood writers and producers (actually their script readers and doctors) are moving toward this notion of creating instant pasts by reference to a few icons, then shaping it as market forces require. Why not? You need to feed the pipeline.

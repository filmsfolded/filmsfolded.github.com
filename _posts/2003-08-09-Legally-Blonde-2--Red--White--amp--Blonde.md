Most films these days are self-aware or self-referential or both. This is so prevalent that viewers only notice it when a movie is direct and takes itself seriously like this one does.

What this movie attempts shows a remarkable degree of engineering. The movie itself is dumb but honest and it is about a character that is dumb but honest (and well-meaning). I call this effect 'folding,' something which seems to have great power. The form of the movie corresponds to its content. Someone smart was behind this.

This is one of two movies I saw this week that exploits post 9-11 American notions of self. We need to be reassured that we are good, that the system is fundamentally healthy, that one person can make a difference and so on.

The other movie was 'Seabiscuit' which pulls on the Democrat message: little guy against fat capitalism, struggling nation getting help from government policy, all people are essentially kindhearted, wounded people and persons coming back and winning and so one there too.

This film pulls on the Republican end: lightweight and lowbrow, celebrates the simple platitude as truth, respect for the stupid but well-meaning. Even features Lincoln and has a female Clarence Thomas type.

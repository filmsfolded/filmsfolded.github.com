Spoilers herein.

One of the highest compliments I can give a movie is that the way it exists as a film. Some  mainstream movies do this: 'Mothman's vision was mothlike. 'Van Helsing' had swoopers  and swooped. 'The Limey' was about revisiting and had mini-revisits in the edit. "Good  Thief" was about a drugged perception of a hyperperceptive man.

Now we have a Ludlum story, originally about the chaos of partial memory and told in a  manner that is the literary equivalent of handheld with inadequate information. Watch what's  done here: the way it is shot and edited combines the hectic chase, the frantic fight and the  dimly recalled narrative. Its a very clever and cinematic formulation: possibly the best car  chase in movies, one of the best fights... and get this: Matt is tolerable, even apt.

They must be setting up Julia for number three.

Some Films Never End

Spoilers herein.

A remake can be a wonderful thing, because in addition to all of the usual things you can  reference, you have the original. This is the best case I know.

Here we have the writer of the original, someone who knew the importance of reference  and layers. We have an edgy, intelligent director at the height of his curiosity about how  the narrative eye works. And we have someone who would become one of our top

cinematographers.

This is, in effect, a film about a film. The first one had Marlowe in a world different than  his own, so in the Altman case we have three layers: Marlow, the world he visits and the  world that world tries to be.

The business about trying to fool the cat. The stuff about the hippie girls (who don't  interest Marlowe sexually), all the stuff about the 'writer' in the nuthouse as a refuge. All  this and more is part of the presentation by the orchestra, a presentation on layering and  observation. More nuanced than the 'Stuntman' of 1980.

This is effective because it is intelligent and all the artists are completely simpatico.  Certainly the best domestic film of that year. I might elevate it to a four.

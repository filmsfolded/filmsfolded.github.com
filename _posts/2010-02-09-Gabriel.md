I came to this because it was Australian, a first film and supposedly risky. It has been some time since a young Australian filmmaker has affected me, and I always put then toward the top of the list.

This, dear friends is simply some yelling. It is no "Ink."

But it got me wondering. Movies are all about satisfying urges. Well, everything is, but the tokens are explicitly here for you to see. But the constraints of the medium and market morph those urges. So what you see is not what you wanted, but what you can get. Over time, you build this dissonance because you live in the world created by constraints.

Here is what I mean. We all wonder about how the world works. So we want cosmologies in our art, grand organizing principles. We want to know what the rules are. So we have stories with grand conspiracies, or mythical worlds with an order, usually bad and good. Or even just a guy with super powers or abilities who wins because he is attuned in a world where justice flows.

But the medium has only a few human activities that are cinematic. One of these is fighting, especially with guns and knives. If you are making a movie on the cheap, you'll have to forgo the standard fireball explosions, usually with the hero walking away slowly.

As a result, we end up with bizarre situations where cosmological forces are shoved into fight movies. This is not the worst example; I saw this with "TMNT," but it is pretty obvious because the movie itself is so unrewarding.

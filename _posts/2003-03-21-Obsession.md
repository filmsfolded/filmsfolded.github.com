Spoilers herein.

dePalma is almost always worth watching, simply because of the novelty of the quirky, engaging way he places us. The camera is highly choreographed, and the 'mood' of the camera movement is tied to the mood and folds of the story. Hitchcock developed this notion, and when dePalma uses it, he doesn't necessarily us any of the specific movements or plot devices. Usually his plot setups are much more cerebral than Hitchcock's except in the cases of 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window,' the two of his films most self-consciously about themselves.

In this case, Brian and Paul liked the linkage so much they did adopt it. The Vertigo linkage was simple: some of the characters create a 'movie' for Jimmy Stewart, and then he creates his own 'movie.' The struggle is among Stewart, the conspirators in the film, and Hitchcock (and us) each of whom struggle for the camera. Each of whom temporarily gain control of the 'eye' and create the history we see.

dePalma goes one better. Instead of relating simple romantic sex to the act of creating a film, he added the element of a child with (as we slowly discover) our eye having been incestuous all along. Father-daughter, lover-loved, kidnapped-ransomed, 'developed,' 'memorialized,' therapy, multileveled paintings. All pretty clever. It works so far as the general viewing public because of the extraordinary mother/child folding that Bujold pulls off.

But, if you are interested in film, it also works because of the way the camera is controlled. 

Unfortunately, in a story worthy of Orson Welles, the studio forced some heavyhanded changes: one of the folds is turned into a clear dream sequence (so there really was no father/daughter sex), and a whole final act was abandoned, where the folding was explicitly revealed.

Oh well. This is minor dePalma. Check out 'Snake Eyes.'

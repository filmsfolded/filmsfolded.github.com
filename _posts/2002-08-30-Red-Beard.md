Spoilers herein.

Here we have another work by one of the the three top masters of film. It is uncomplicated and deep and highly regarded by many because of its accessibility and the high level of craft made obvious. But there is a deep problem here.

One should say at the outset that even a problematic film by Kurosawa is still worth more than nearly everything else that enters the popular stream. But there was a reason Kurosawa collapsed after this. There is a reason it marks the end of an era.

Kurosawa's anchor mastery is that he not only knows his way around the three disciplines of film (writing, dealing with actors, creating a vision), he knows how to fuse them. The more abstract the center of the story-vision, the more complete that fusion. But as his fame grew with his value to the studio, he came under greater pressure to be accessible and in this case he chose to explicitly moralize.

That is where the disaster is rooted. In the past (and later) he was able to start with visual notions and build everything around that: the story, the noh-centric acting (except in terms of immediacy), and of course the moving frame we see. But this time, he reaches further than ever into the lowest common denominator of popular life. And unfortunately for us, that territory is exclusively literary. He borrows from Yamamoto and Dostoyevsky and gives us a series of episodes whose points we get, but by getting them, we place ourselves in a literary place in our mind, not a visual one.

In other words, what makes him important is his ability to invest images with narrative. Go back and look at some of his early films with no sound or subtitles. You can completely get it. The words are only there to mollify our brain. Now flash forward to this. What we have is an illustrated book, where all the narrative motion is in the spoken exposition. The difference in center is startling.

No question that the pictures are still masterful. Still highly formal in composition and more importantly in the motion of the camera. But the pictures are now in service to the story (the way more mundane directors work) rather than the other way around. One still marvels at the eye, especially the shot where the new doctor is engaged with the mad woman, but at the same time, one grieves that the Master has lost his center.

What's left is a long, slow journey back to the triumph of 'Ran,' made ever so more important because of this voyage of the creative soul to recapture itself. Just as depicted in that film.

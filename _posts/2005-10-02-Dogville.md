Its somewhat confusing to many viewers that we exist in a world where art is partly message and partly essays on messages. Most films are both, have this dual identity. How they interact is something I call "folding."

It is easier to see the more essay component there is, the much less interesting. If folding is justifiable at all, it is because it enhances the power of art. So, when you evaluate a pure essay, as we have here, you have to ask: is it intelligent? Does it add something somewhere? Does it matter?

Is the art that incidentally accompanies it powerful?

Von Trier is more an essayist on films and film-making than he is a filmmaker. He stays in that one camp. This contrasts him from real filmmakers whose intent is to affect our lives so swing between introspective insight and the fluids of life itself. Say, Hartley, Twyker or Egoyan or even Luhrmann. On the Hollywood side perhaps Lynch, dePalma. And of course we have the whole pack of recent Spanish-speaking filmmakers.

So does Von Trier say anything interesting here? Is it worth experiencing? When I ask that question in a crowd of relatively intelligent thinkers in film, the answer is that it hardly matters. You have to listen to whoever has the floor, whether he is saying something new or not.

It is more important that other people are listening than we do. Oh my!

Well, what we have here is yet another exploration in cinematic abstraction, yet again in the direction of Chekov sparseness. He's denoted this crudely with the sets which both evoke theatrical minimalism and that notion that a few common, everyday indicators can outline uncommon depth.

Unfortunately he selected actors who don't understand this notion of precision by circumnavigation. Our heroine, Nichole, does well when she is a malleable pawn. Luhrmann performed wonders with her without her knowledge. But here she needed to be able to draw, she needed to be Julianne Moore in "Vanya on 42nd Street."

If you want brilliant essays on film, go to Greenaway, not von Trier

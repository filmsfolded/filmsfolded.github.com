Fortune's wand passed over these guys for a few years and they gave us a particular kind of humor.

Two kinds, actually. And this movie has great examples of each, woven into what already had become disturbing MGM padding. Oh, you should know that I consider the best of their films to be the earliest where they packed the things with relatively non-stop zaniness. 

Of the two types of Marx humor, the most interesting is the word play. This was new to movies and in fact the industry sought them out from the New York stage where verbal humor was well established. Their one verbal skit in this project is the argument between Chico and Groucho over a contract. "Just go over the first part of the party of the First Part." Its classic.

The second kind of humor is a sort of layered craziness that builds and builds with all sorts of comic effects that have nothing to do with each other. That's what makes it "zany," not that what they do is funny but that they serve us from so many different traditions at the same time. The exemplar scene this time is the breakfast scene, ending when the cop comes and then they shift to simply one bit: frustrate the cop.

I suppose it won't be long before some clever editor makes one movie out of all the good bits of what we have from them, without the love stories and the singing. And without the ordinary jokes. For instance there's a dreadful bit in here about the three stowaways stealing beards and making speeches at a reception for the expected, celebrated aviators. Its a grind, literally a painful grind to watch this bit.

I think it should be possible to combine all their good parts together since the stories are so similar (except the anti-war bits of "Duck Soup"). We really should have this because the bad parts (oh, those songs!) keep audiences away. How many other entertainers can claim to have invented even one form of cinematic humor?

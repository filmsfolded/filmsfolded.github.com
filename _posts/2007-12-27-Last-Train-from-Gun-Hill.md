Once upon a time, before "Once upon a Time in the West," we really did have westerns that took themselves seriously. Some, like this, were so late in the game they had to be mechanical.

In terms of characters you had to have the stoic marshall, probably once "on the wrong side," but now representing the nation through its surrogate, the law.

You must have a girl to fall in love with the hero. Ideally she will be a reconstituted whore with a heart of gold.

You must have some sort of artificial driver for the plot. In this case, it is the need for one honest man to walk into a town where everyone is against him, and somehow bring back two rapists on the nine o'clock train. Its all mechanical and the predictability of the thing was embedded in the genre.

Oh. And because these are ALWAYS about the national character, you have to have some issue driven by one of the core values of the time: family, justice, honor. Here the implementation is particularly blunt: family and justice (partially as revenge, partially as endorsement of the law) versus family and honor. America always wins in these things. Good old America, affirmed by the quick draw.

There's only one oddity. The marshall's wife is a Native American, played by an Israeli in orange makeup and died black hair. The oddity is that the same makeup and hair is applied to Anthony Quinn, the other man here.

This is not worth seeing as a film. The acting is particularly wooden and it adds to the mechanical tedium. But it is interesting as one of the last westerns that took itself seriously, without that John Ford notion of the nobility of the fistfight.

Spoilers herein.

This was made during the period when we still were high on the mere existence of film, so it was enough to just flaunt theatrical excess. But it is pretty good excess in retrospect, because it defined (or cemented) a few types and moves that are still with us.

The setup is this: the world is divided into two halves: the performers and the watchers.

Garbo is a performer, literally, in the story. Barrymore's Baron (!) is also playing a role.

Three characters apparently cross over: the meek, dying accountant who goes from being a nobody to a somebody purely by chance; the stenographer and sometime model is a watcher (literally a recorder in the story) who aspires to be somebody; and the prima donna's dresser who ostensibly watches but becomes a fabricator.

Meanwhile, maids and bellboys and clerks watch and serve. They are anchored by the battlescarred doctor who seems to be a professional audience and who relates performance to war. (The relation of performance to prostitution and or lying, a major line in films that follow, is only hinted here.)

The script follows the play closely, and it shows in two obvious ways. It is remarkably more polished than similar scripts of the period, and it allows pairs (usually John and one of the two lead actresses) to have well-shaped dialog with their faces impossibly close. 

All this refined excess is impossible today. But it is worth watching for more than nostalgic reasons.

By the way, a great many films have one scene that you can tell was the one that all the creative talent used as the center of the project: by getting it right and all the visions coherent, the rest of the thing grows from that seed. Here it is the shot of Garbo in her costume, butterfly on shoulder (check out Drew's tattoo), undressing, kissing her shoes while we know that someone is watching other than ourselves.

Interesting fact: of all the films that all these stars made, only one is in IMDb's top 250 list, and that one ('Wonderful Life') has Lionel in a minor role.

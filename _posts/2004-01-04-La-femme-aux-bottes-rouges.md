Spoilers herein.

The elder Bunuel made films that were slickly vacuous, thinly self-referential and highly  abstract, but they had some cinematic consistency. I find even the most celebrated  trivial.

The younger made this. It doesn't flow well, and is devoid of any visual sensibility. But I  found it much more intelligent and adventurous.

A writer writes a book that is this story. Her lover is a painter who paints this story. They  encounter a publicist whose job is to make things seem different than they are, and a  millionaire who is intent on manipulating local reality as a pull on art.

The entire thing comes from an egg. The entire thing comes from a vision in a pub. The  entire thing is a vision created by Francoise. The entire thing is a story in a letter  intercepted and soaped, or an intricate chess game in three dimensions that creates in  three dimensions, or a dream of the valet's.

Or a history of her husband recounted by Leonore to herself as she paints her face in  public - or perhaps just a phantasm in the night during an unexpected picnic.

Maybe it is a bad movie that charmed me through the several century old magic of  Prospero, who is quoted here throughout.

Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 3 - Worth watching

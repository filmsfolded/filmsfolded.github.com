Spoilers herein.

These types of films are hard to pull off, the ones that have two levels. Usually, one level  creates or influences the other, and in that case the agent is a writer or filmmaker or  photographer. The gold standard in my book is "French Lieutenant's Woman." Probably  the most folded is " Saragossa Manuscript."  Or, you can have it the other way with a  ghost from the other layer meddling across dimensions. I have hundreds of different  versions of these in my database.

Ms Bigelow tries something very ambitious here: she has two pulls on one layer: both  the writer and photographer, both creating the world of each other at the same time  they examine (and co-create?) the past. At the same time, she has the ghost from the  past reaching forward, also through the written word. Also through sex.

To do things like this, you need "folded" actors, actors that can perform on two levels  simultaneously. She selected two that are famous for this ability: Sean Penn who without  doubt is our finest living folded actor, and Sarah Polley who is the best female upcomer  in this tradition. (Kate, Cate and Julianne are the senior members of that guild.)

But to pull this off, is to "pull on pulls," and requires someone whose insight and artistry  can earn the place at the top of the pyramid. Bigelow is smart enough to know where  that place is. This at once puts her in an elite group -- but she is incapable of the climb.  Penn and Polley are lost. They cannot reach each other.

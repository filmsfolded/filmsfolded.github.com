Another film -- this time masterful -- constituted of writing about writing. Some of it troubles, some satisfies. 

First, the terrible. The novel worked very hard to make it clear that the nature of the world revealed is the world we live in. That's what makes the writing so powerful. We together with our surrogate the young writer discover this about our world and our place within it. 

This does not survive the transition to film. Film has a strong -- almost unavoidable "noir" tradition, where an unsuspecting Joe gets caught up in a weird, artificial world. Unfortunately, the people involved here chose to exploit this tradition. That means we get a parade of the strange that we can observe from the outside rather than discovering we are in it.

The good news is that as long as that is the game, these folks know how to do it. The position that used to be held by the reader is now reduced to the little girl. 

The whole thing revolves around one scene, as these often are. The scene is when Kim's character leaves. She spends a moment with her husband, the stunted writer of what we see. That one moment brings the two cosmologies together, those of the film and the book. It is all in Kim's face, which hosts a symphony of intents and regrets. It is what we expected in Halle Barry's face at a similar moment that all of "Monster's Ball," builds to, the end on the back stoop.

I wish this were as potentially life-altering and subversive as the book. Instead, it is merely well done drama, better than usual but something we can merely watch.

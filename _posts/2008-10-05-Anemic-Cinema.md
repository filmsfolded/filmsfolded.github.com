Just because something happened, doesn't mean that it matters. Just because some artist farts controllably doesn't mean we should enter it.

This was unimportant when it was new, and only slightly less so now. I say slightly because film as a whole has lost a certain sense of adventure that this possesses.

If you do not know it, the short consists of various revolving spirals of the type usually used in later movies as a device to hypnotize some character. Interspersed are revolving disks with random phrases printed on them. The obvious intent is to imbue the designs with something like the syntactic import or words. Saying so doesn't make it so.

Its not anti-art in this case. Just a bad idea.

Spoilers herein.

All movies start with a bald fact: there is the filmmaker (or group making the film) and  there is us, the viewers. They manipulate us. Its their job to anticipate our moves, to  travel along beside us and intervene to frustrate our normal routes.

Some films are ABOUT such an intervention, a manipulation. Even though the Freddy  movies are cheesy, they stand on this intelligent notion (made explicit in one of the  sequels where Craven enters the plot). In such cases, the filmmaker is expected to be a  brutal to us as his monster is to whatever hapless victim is involved. So we have all sorts  of assaults on us -- many of these clearly staged for their effect on us rather than on the  victim in the film.

So far, the idea is pretty common. 

There's a similar notion in "Bladerunner," that the plot involves creating a person out of  nothing just like a filmmaker does, and the notion of borrowed memories is common to  both the film and the story within the film. Hauer symbolizes that for most of us, an  association he has been exploiting ever since.

Here we have the two notions combined. Pretty effectively and cheaply, I'd say. The flaws  are significant, though. They didn't know how to end it, and that's important when  dealing with such matters. "Identity" and "Silence of the Lambs" did it well. The other flaw  is the misuse of JJ Leigh. She's not a great actress. She doesn't have what Depp has, but  she comes from a similar awareness of self-reference. Here, she is badly drawn (sorry).

John Waters is a hit and miss thing for me. What he does is what so many do: engineer the creation of a near-reality and overlay it on reality. He's best when he works directly with the notion of movies (Cecil B Demented) and songs as here.

This works. Its a "Grease," better than "Grease," because its folding with reality is better engineered. 

Conflating the jailbreak with the viewing of a horror movie, the appearance of hatchetface (an ugly girl) and the escape across town of children from the orphanage -- all to 50's music -- is a stroke of cinematic genius.

Next, Ricki Lake gives birth in the back of a car speeding in a game of piggyback chicken... The greasers here are called "drapes;" now who would ever think of that?

Compare this to his similar attempt using sex. What a disaster. Here, he gets to leverage 65 years of experimenting with how music IN a story overlaps with music over the story.

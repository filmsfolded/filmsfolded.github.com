This was celebrated in its day. Since then, several things have changed.

One is that the peculiar French racism, though not as out of fashion as the American version of the time, has been revealed as what it is. The engaging abstract quality of the Greek drama has here been reduced a similar simplification, but to stereotypes: the sweaty, muscular buck, the even sweatier, sex-hunting watermelon eating lunk, the sexy black woman who is all breasts and scowls, other black women of type... and all of them grinning into a future that values dancing above all else.

And of course it isn't just dancing but what in its day was considered closer to sex than walking.

Its amazing that the noble "Amos and Andy" is still forbidden but this retains the reputation of its Oscar.

The second thing is though the music and color was somewhat bold for the day (we're talking 50 years ago), there's scant enjoyment to be gotten from it today. That leaves us to marvel and settle into the film-making and story. Or not, because there is not much of either here -- just another example of continental sentimental expressionism.

You really do deserve better than this in your life.

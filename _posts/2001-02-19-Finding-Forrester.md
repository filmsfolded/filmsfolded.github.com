Spoilers herein.

I did a fair amount of research on this film before seeing it, so was prepared to hate it. I knew that it had been commissioned by Uncle Sean to emulate 'Good Will Hunting.' That film gave me a toothache with its complete lack of understanding of the pain associated with mathematical insight. I expected the same with writing, but this time instead of Williams' excesses, we'd get the bombast of Connery.

I was largely right, but some things pleasantly surprised me. The young lead, Robert Brown held his focus. (He is the 17th Robert Brown to be listed in the IMDB!) It is not precisely good acting yet, but he lent comfort to the enterprise. And Van Sant had more competence with the angles and editing than he has shown before. The framing and underlying jazz set a pleasant beat.

But the effort was a failure, I think for two reasons.

Many films are written about writing, some even using this weakly self-referential device of the word and action on the screen having congruence. To make it work, you have to show the power of words, the power of the choice behind them, the commitment of soul that each concept demands in forming. None of that here. Writing seems equated to typing somehow -- 'Pound those keys!' -- or that writing is a "natural" talent -- or that it has something to do with "test scores." This is the same prime weakness as in 'Good Will,' but it is not because a popular film cannot accommodate a deeper vision: see 'Wonder Boys.'

There is a secondary weakness too, and this alone would have killed the film. The writer knew enough to sketch the cinematic metaphor of inside and outside. (Oh how I wish he could also have given us overlying narratives of inner and outer poetry!) But with all of Van Sant's polishing, he completely missed the opportunity for tight versus open spaces. Forrester's cubby seems spacious, unconfining. How could he miss this opportunity to cramp the camera!

I think I know why. In doing so, he would make at least partly an architectural film. That means the camera wouldn't focus so exclusively on the boss. And the boss wants a statue.

Spoilers herein.

Another Altman film about filmmaking. I wonder why so many people miss this.

Balaban is from an old film family and is among the more intellectual men in the business. Altman spends an inordinate amount of time thinking about the art and how he differs from others. And he does. Now you don't have to imagine what they talk about.

The conventional approach to high quality visual directing is for it all to emanate as a vision in the author and/or director's mind. The actors are expected to recreate that vision. So when a particularly strong image results, it is because the actor filled in the space in front of the camera. Think of this as actors in service to the director, the employer.

Altman is different in a fundamental way. He comes up with a vague sketch of a script: descriptions of characters and a situation. He allows the actors to find their own way. The result is often -- as here -- remarkably dense, taught, real. So much finer than can be filtered through several minds. Think of this as the director is service to the actors.

Here's where the upstairs/downstairs metaphor comes in.

Now think how Altman works with his camera. He has astonishing movement. His legendary reputation as a filmmaker rests primarily on his skill in adding to the effect of the scene by making our eye an active part of what is going on by placing lights and moving the camera. Hitchcock invented this notion, but then he is in that large group of directors who simply boss the actors about. Easy to place the camera right when you know where everything is going to be. But what if you don't? Then you have to be the perfect servant, understanding your masters so thoroughly that you can anticipate what they are going to do.

There you have the idea that Balaban and Altman first sketched. Now to make it highly self-referential, what do you do? You set a conventional murder mystery and actually place the filmmaker in the middle of the action, continuously commenting on how this is to be shaped. But he's completely ignorant, hence the references to formulaic Charlie Chan. The real solution would only be known by someone who understands this notion of anticipative service. Enhance the metaphor with notions of 'children' from the upstairs through the wombs of the downstairs.

More: make it obvious that we are talking about the moving camera eye, so actually insert Ivor Novello in the action as 'entertainment.' Ivor was in 'The Lodger,' Hitchcock's first film where he used this 'moving eye' style. His attunement to Ivor's movements (it is a silent film) was what was so remarkable at the time. Notice that Balaban doesn't 'shoot.'

Altman is not a man of half measures, so make it even more self-referential: make one (only one) of the privileged guests disguise himself as a servant, to cross the line. You can't play on both teams.

This is not a film about manners, not a costume drama, not a whodunit. The story is about what it is: a film about the fluid, anticipative eye, in service to some of the most talented theatrical actors alive. The enjoyment in this film is not in watching the actors, pleasant though that is; it is in watching how we watch the actors and marveling at how our eye becomes part of the 'team.'

Every actor here, every footman and scullery maid is a better actor than Julia Roberts, who incidentally shot Balaban in the throat in Mexico. Every actor except Ryan Phillippe. He's the white space, the reference point of bland American fare, intended to show us what bad acting is all about. Notice how staid the camera is when following him.

It is all heavy symbolism and would be the first thing commented on in a P T Andersen film. But not here. Now that's art.

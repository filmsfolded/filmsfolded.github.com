Spoilers herein.

Biblical scholars spend a lot of time looking at the text to tease out who inserted what part in order to change the meaning of the rest and thus promote their own point of view. One can do that here as well.

Spielberg's style is to completely design everything ahead of time in storyboards. The film is designed as a comic. Then in production, he's blam blam blam. Kubric's notion of filmmaking is to just start and muddle about until the film emerges. Spielberg notion is to deal with comfortable realities (yes, even -- especially -- in Schindler), to abstract emotions and motivations to the simplest, and exaggerate their effects. The camera is invisible in his films. Kubric's camera is always acknowledged. His films are self-consciously films and he likes to posit uncomfortable emotional physics. It is not complex so much as sophisticated. Spielberg is inherently optimistic, Kubric is the opposite.

These two notions cannot mix, so we have bits of one, then another. The problem is that Kubric is such a powerful cinematic thinker that even dead he overpowers Spielberg, even though poor Stephen is doing all the work. The editing is poor here, but shortening the film would make the jarring shifts in world-views more apparent. 

Incidentally, in 200 years, we have evolved AI, but our computers and screens are the same as now? And doorknobs and roads and food and beds and clothes (even including those neck labels)? Even pills are the same? At the demo derby there aren't more clever ways of destruction (probably the single most innovative sector of industry)?

Osment is interesting in playing a machine that plays a child. But Law uses a completely different, radically different acting approach to portraying a robot. David's basic mechanism is supposed to be the same, but these guys are in different movies. Francis O'Conner did the best acting; she did a superb job in "Mansfield Park" too. Someone to watch.

I think the boss must have known he was in trouble. At about the third false ending, the kid is trapped by a falling ferris wheel oddly reminiscent of his biggest (until now) failure, 1941. This isn't bold filmmaking, it is incompetent filmmaking because Spielberg tried to do something that wasn't simple and wasn't up to it. "Hook" was a competent execution of an odd view, just that the odd view didn't connect with viewers. It is a better film than this one which never finds its world.

I've been in AI for 30 years now. The term is obsolete now as the various factions coalesce around different theories and goals. In fact, the notion behind this film is from the 70s, in scientific terms placing this at the Jules Verne level. The notion of a single scientist working essentially alone always was a film conceit, and seems to here be reference to Bladerunner which itself referenced Frankenstein. That also puts the film in a quaint distant past.

A strong theory now has it that emotions may be the among the FIRST basic capabilities required to adaptively learn and support abstract reasoning, and that the human model of reasoning is clearly not a superior option.

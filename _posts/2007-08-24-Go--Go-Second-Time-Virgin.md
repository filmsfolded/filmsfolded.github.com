How do you watch an old movie?

Until recently, when video rentals and media sales allowed films to have persistent markets, movies were set in their context. Movies were made, the commercial ones, to last a few weeks and perhaps make some money. Then, the film would be recycled, the messages lost and the material reused.

Few of the creators had any notion that someone would be watching in 40 years, or even 400. 

Now as it happens, I was watching films when this was made, so even though I'm coming to it out of its context, I do know the Manson murders and some notion of where Japanese film and society were. But the truth is that I cannot connect with this the way the filmmaker intended; I'm just too far removed in time and culture.

I can guess from the outside: the nudity would have been shocking in the time and place; the dramatic devices more effective. The depiction of society as fundamentally damaged is universal and reachable but not through the vehicles used here: the Japanese obsessions with virginal sex; the particular abstractions of Japanese comics; the Japanese tradition of suicide, essentially religious; the Japanese tradition of ritualized stage drama -- the role that filmmakers played in Japanese society as challengers of culture that has no counterpart in the west.And then there's the dark side of zen, that violence heals.

So how do I watch this? Do I pretend I am the intended audience? I do that for some films, and in some cases where it is a film I have seen, I recapture that prior self as well as the filmmaker's intended effect. And if I am pretending, do I go as far as pretend to be the audience the filmmaker is criticizing instead of being on the filmmaker's side?

Do I watch it for historical value, looking for its place in the development of films that do affect me directly today? That's easy enough, given the importance of Kurosawa to me, based on a connection that largely transcends context. But it seems a lot of layers to go through for something that was meant so simply.

The story here is of a girl who defines herself as a virgin because she bleeds when gangraped. We learn that she imagines a previous gangrape but in fact she has been serially abused by her father, making both parents suicide. There's a celebration of the sometimes warm, sometimes cold concrete on which this blood is displayed. A boy provides an on screen watcher, intended to be ourselves, folded into the story. He -- and the imputed we -- have tremendous problems with sex, alternately hot and cold. Violent or adverse. We kill everyone we see, something underscored by photographs of a filmmaker (Polanski) and murdered wife (Sharon Tate).

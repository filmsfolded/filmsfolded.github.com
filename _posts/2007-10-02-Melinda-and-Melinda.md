I think I know how Woody works. First he has an idea about the type of narrative experiment he wants to do. My favorites are "Sweet and Lowdown" which is subversively clever, and "Annie Hall," which is something of a museum of narrative folds. But you can trace each film back to some novel narrative device that he has not done before. Here, it is a film about filmmakers discussing films and as they imagine two braided stories, we see them, jumping between them and in and out of the dinner discussion, which incidentally looks a lot like "My Dinner with Andre." Oh, and those stories? They involve film people, plus performers of other kinds.

Second he devises some story. This is wholly independent of the narrative trick. It usually deals with insecurity and love, but who cares? Its the cinematic narrative that makes him special. 

Only at last does he make lines and characters. I think the lines define the characters rather than the other way around, as actors would normally have it. This stuff is what most movie- goers see, it seems. But if you come for just that, you'll be disappointed most of the time, because the center of gravity in Woodland is elsewhere, in the structure. I can easily imagine Woody acting out each of the parts, every line, for the actors.

Its something of a burden. He's a bad actor because his range is so narrow, and that limits every one of his projects. He's an uneven director. Its because he is steeped in study, so while he is sometimes a competent director every place he succeeds in bringing his narrative to cinematic expression, he does so by using techniques of others in a bewildering scope. (This is where Hitchcock excelled.)

Its in that first step where his genius shows. No one else ever has had the imagination, the range, the willingness and the success in narrative form as our Woody. He must think he is nearing the end, what with the crazy projects he's been putting together, some apparently trite (those Scarlet ones) and some deceptively light, like this. Its almost as if he has a grid, a map of all the territory he might know in terms of how to kink narrative, and he only wants to go to those spots without pins in them. 

I'm glad he's alive.

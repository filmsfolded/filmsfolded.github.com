This comment is for the "director's cut of 140 or so minutes. I understand there is a twenty minute shorter initial theatrical release. This film seems overlong compared to the "standard," but it is hard to imagine what could be taken out. There is also a four hour cut, which I hope to see some day. 

This has a strange tone. The space isn't fully filled narratively or visually, so you might get bored. But what happens here is that the narrative elements have room to breath; some of the actors know how to create echoes in this cave: Johnny, Lili and sometimes Jerry. The others know what this is about and how to shrink and rebound dynamically. Its all about drifting with balloons, swimming with fish and baying with dogs, and the insertions are sometimes obtrusive. Allow this and you'll be okay.

What you'll experience here are three levels of artifice:

-- there's the business of narrative folding: its dreams, visions, yearnings, performances and salesmanship, all "causing" the others in a multinest.

-- the distillation of noir agency in the aforementioned balloon-fish-dog metaphor, the three pieces of which are related to us in a "movie within," provided before the credits of the movie proper.

-- distinct references to other, "outer" movies. There are dozens of these, the largest being associated with Gallo's character. He is an aspiring actor, and what we see him do (in an amateur show) is an "impression" of Cary Grant's scene in "North By Northwest" where all he does is look at his watch (for a very long time) then be chased by an airplane. He copies other movies as well, but this one is woven into the movie proper. I suppose some of the extra four hour stuff hits the other films he acts: "Raging Bull," "Wizard of Oz" and "The Godfather."

See it. You may never see anyone like Lili Taylor in her performance here again.

Spoilers herein.

Charlize is made up to look like Mia Farrow, but cannot come close to the vulnerable waif of Polanski's masterpiece. And the director has none of the skills of Polanski, in fact, since we have no pale failures, it appears that he didn't even recognize some Polanski tricks.

What's interesting about this project is Johhny. I find him fascinating though I admit following him around is often a trial. He takes a lot of risks with his choices of roles. He takes some chances in how he commits to the role. He commits pretty heavily here. He's not a Sean Penn, but it is interesting to watch him try.

Incidentally, he reinforces an interesting stereotype. Movies are never about life, they are about other movies, But life is often about movies: for instance it is well known that gangsters don't feel like gangsters unless they affect some film cliches.

Same with astronauts. Chuck Yeager was a good Â‘ol boy with a Texas drawl. Coincidentally, early in the Apollo program, the center was moved to the irrational location of Houston Texas because of Lyndon Johnson. As a result of these two things, every astronaut and astronaut wannabee since then has taken on a Texas accent. For instance, today on any American airline when the pilot begins the approach for landing, they annouce "we have begun our dee'-sent" (on Houston-based Continental you'll hear dee' siyent), because that's what Yaeger said and how he said it.

Depp knows he's under the control of a director who can only see a small part of what he does, So with all that extra space, he pokes fun at this stereotype. Fun.

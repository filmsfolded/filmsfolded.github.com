Spoilers herein.

James Brooks drives me a little batty. He makes films (and TeeVee shows) with smart self-reference but a juvenile sweet innocence. The ruthless incisiveness of the first contradicts the mildness of the second. It dissolves any effect his projects might have.

The only value comes in the infrequent comic bits, with the main one here being a newly red Joan Cusack's rush in the beginning. All else is trite, compared to other journeys into this land such as 'Network' and 'Smoochy.'

TeeVee values belong on TeeVee, so we know what part of town to avoid.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3 Â– has some interesting elements

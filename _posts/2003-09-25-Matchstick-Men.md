Spoilers herein.

Actors love to play actors, and con "artists" qualify, setting us up for the play within the  play. In clever layered films of this type, the play within usually has a play within it -- a  con within a con within the con that is the movie in the first place.

This version has two features of note. Con movies are the reverse of mystery movies: we  expect the storytellers to play tricks on us. We expect to know no more than the guy  being conned. That gives Scott extra license to tie the point of view to his main  character. He exploits this by giving Cage all sorts of mannerisms: ticks, jumps, triple  stutters, ejaculations. Each of these is given to us as well through the camera. Jump cuts,  smooth rolls, odd inerts, triple alloys, all to have how we see concur with what we see.  Scott does this well and it is clearly his reason for doing the film.

But he also brings an ability to exploit and pervert the genre. In this case he never really  lets us know it is a con film until the end: he submerges the confidence activities under  Cage's peculiar behavior. He enters "Family Man"/"Paper Moon" territory and plays those  chords so effectively we forget where we are, just like Cage.

Thank God for Ridley Scott. He's not the only intelligent director in Hollywood, but he is  the only one who practices continuity of scenes one to the other by having the actors  project forward. Previously he did this with an expectant tone in the reading, picked up  by the first couple beats of the next shot. Here, he reduces it to the smallest unit: beats,  not measures.

You know, some of these Poirot adaptations are palatable. And some are dreadful. This is one of the dreadful ones. I'll concede one thing: the casting is near perfect, considering the limits of TeeVee. The faces and bearing of the characters are apt, though Suchet bothers me more as his years in to role dragged on.

It had already been more than a decade by this one, and you can see that where Christie's character was playing with aggressive intelligence a character imagined in his home land, Suchet is merely copying motions he made before that were vaguely comic.

(Its part of the joke. Sherlock Holmes cared not a whit about how he looked or whether his mental feats were ever known. Indeed, in several stories he hides his accomplishments. But Poirot is obsessive about his appearance, his food and how he is perceived. He is motivated to solve crime not because of an inner conflict with evil, but in how he can best evil in order to advance in the battle against himself.) But what kills this is the script. It takes away the magic of the standard final confrontation where Poirot confronts all the suspects and explains how each of them "did" it, settling on one who really did. In that instant, we are supposed to see how all we have seen now makes sense.

But in this case it doesn't. Little of it makes sense. We don't discover why any of the characters acted as they did, and surely not the murderer. We don't know why the elevator went up and down mysteriously, nor why "sandwich paste" figures in at all.

Its the least complete of any I have seen. The whole room of viewers I was with had no idea what had happened after it was over. You need to avoid this one.

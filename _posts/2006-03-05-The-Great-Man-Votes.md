Let me recommend this to you. But first, some history.

This was toward the end of the "the great shakeout" in movies. The first one was in the first decades of the form and was a battle of the arts to determine just what movies would be. There were a surprising number of evolutionary paths that could have been followed. What won was the notion of a theatrical play, but mimed and made larger. I mark "Birth of the Nation" as the turning point there.

Later with talkies the whole bag of possibilities was revisited. A huge number -- much larger than before -- of possibilities emerged this second time, but with less variety. Most of them were extensions of existing theatrical and literary traditions. Again, there was a rough and tumble competition that resulted in the genres we have today.

This was the end of one of those possibilities, and seeing it makes us a bit sad because it was rich in its own way. And deeply self-referential.

Watching the movie in its day was casting a certain type of vote for it, and the story is about a vote. This might be the very last of this type of movie, and the story features a voting precinct in which there is only one voter left.

Oh, I guess I should tell you the plot. Barrymore plays a former Harvard professor with two kids. His wife has died and he is now a drunk. He is in danger of losing his kids. For amazingly artificial plot means, the entire country will vote the way a certain region will, and that region in turn will vote the way a certain precinct will. And this, my friends, is the precinct in which our hero is the only registered voter.

As he votes, the future of the world may change. There's some bumph about the ward boss and his bratty kid and all. But the whole construction was written just for Barrymore and for him to be a drunk version of a prior giant. That giant in the story is a professor, but he is played as a special kind of character that only exists in a now defunct theatrical world. He's in fact, an actor, a grand speechifier in the Booth Shakespearian tradition of 19th century elocution. It seems a bit comic today, but this was a noble characterization in its time.

It was, in fact, the offscreen persona of Barrymore. And offscreen he really was a drunk. And this really was his last major role -- and it was played with him actually fallingdown drunk, doing his bit as automatically as breathing. Everyone else in the drama is designated audience: his kids, their schoolmarm, his in-laws, the gawking townspeople (ready to follow his vote), even the newspapers.

It used to be that you could go to a movie and in some of them expect this posturing, this extremely dramatic pedagogical exaggeration, something that goes all the way back to Shakespeare's Holofernes. It used to be enough to just swim in the excess. We still have some echo of that in Pacino and other Italian-influenced frenzies, but the excuse there is intensity rather than the flow of the thing.

If you watch this, there's an amazing speech at the end. Our man has cast his vote (which we discover was against the machine -- and we know that after the movie ends he will be killed or the equivalent). He is speaking to the whole world, and gives a speech that has the form of an old-style Shakespearean one. It goes up and down. It has inverted constructions and leaps of metaphor. His has Barrymore being more.

And it makes no sense at all. It really doesn't and I'm sure that no viewer at the time knew this (it takes careful parsing to discover), nor cared. It was the show of the thing. Only the show.

This could make it onto my "must watch" list.

There's some good movie-making in the background too. Look at one scene where the kids are going to school and see how nicely we watch their feet performing in a simple echo of their Dad.

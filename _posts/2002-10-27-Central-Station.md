Spoilers herein.

This has such promise in the two or three moments when the lettersenders dictate. It would have been in the Latin tradition of fine film to have made something of the writer inventing the reality of the film.

But no. Other than the letterwriters, the whole thing is a treacly, sentimental morality play.

Watch this only if you are interested in the religious superstitions of rural Brazil.

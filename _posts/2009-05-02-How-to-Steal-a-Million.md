The story here is about a scheme to capture a certain statue -- a nude Venus -- that incidentally is supposed to resemble Audrey Hepburn. The caper is interesting, all the way to the resolution at the end.

This story form mirrors the main experience, which is simply yet another of the relatively rare encounters with the extraordinary Audrey. She is not nude here, instead clothed as usual by the equally extraordinary Givenchy. But the rest is true: the whole experience is one of capturing her on screen: her strange mix of bigness and smallness. Her strange mix of self- conscious poise and spontaneous directness. There never has been this sort of photogenic being, and because the precedent now is set, no one likely ever will. 

It is extraordinary. Her shadow was Jackie Kennedy, and the mere association made JFK more loved and better remembered than he would have been.

Peter O'Toole, one of the our most committed screen beings, is here dedicated to simply showing admiring awe. Quite a role.

This is perhaps the most simply endearing of her characters, Holly Golightly being deliberately complex. Here, she is deliberately uncomplicated, no forgery, no copy, no statue. But great art.

Spoilers herein.

One thing I am learning in my study of films: a film can be important and bad. 

By important I mean that films are largely about other films, with a few here and there establishing new elements of the visual grammar. That grammar - both in what is says and how it says it - has a profound influence on how we think about ourselves and life in general. This film is important in the sense that it establishes - or purely expresses - many elements of that visual grammar in a highly stylized manner. 

But in doing so, it is so exaggerated, so blunt, so studiously unnuanced that it any other context it would seem campy. The war between the hands already is camp, post-Strangelove.

Watch this and marvel at the economy: the phallic train, the sledgehammer score, the use of song, the exploitation of the child's face, the monosyllabic sky.

Every element is refined into an image and blared, save one: the Tuesday whoring of Ruby (casually forgiven).

Incidentally, the anti-man theme is a little off-putting. Men are drunks (Steptoe), sexually obsessed (the blase townsboys), nitwits (Spoon), fatally mistaken (Harper), remote (Cooper's son) or just plain evil (Powell). Our relation to the film is intended to be just as the relationship of Pearl to the doll, exclusively maternal (and full of unfulfillable promise).

I'm putting this on my 'recommend' list, not because it is remotely enjoyable, but as an example of visual storytelling - albeit offensively banal.

Kael, who judges films as if they were amusement park rides, calls this 'noir,' which is to my mind a profound misunderstanding. A noir film is always set in a universe with a capricious fate, beyond the logic of religion (or anything else). This film is as far from that as one can get: the universe here is one run by simple biblical justice.

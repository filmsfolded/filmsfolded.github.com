Spoilers herein.

Herzog is one of the few artists in my experience where the more you know about the man himself, the more you can appreciate his films -- not as films but as the artifact of an artistic life.

The man is absolutely crazy. Manic. Possessed. His approach to filmmaking requires physical and psychic danger. He engages in broad sweeps of risk.

One of those is his collaboration with another madman, Kinski, a more flamboyant man, but probably a more honest one. That's because Herzog sees his job as collecting various touchstones in life, amplified by these risks, refined into broad metaphors and woven into a story. And that's what he's done with this apparent documentary. He's taken some experiences and traits and archived footage and woven a mostly fictitious story with his trademark metaphors and crisp contrasts. 

No matter that the truth is bent -- indeed, that's the job of the artist. No matter that Herzog claims sanity while depicting Kinski (and actually all his players) as mad -- in fact convincing us of the rightness of his vision is also seen by Herzog as his job. But some of the slips are pretty funny. 'I'm not crazy, well maybe except for the time I tried to firebomb him. And that time in Peru, I really wouldn't have shot him.'

There's a wonderful image in this film. Most Herzog films have one that sticks. It is of him showing his journal while in Peru. I cannot recall which project ('Wrath' or Fitzcarraldo'), but he was holed up in a tent in the real wilderness for weeks alone. During that time he was in an altered state and wrote several journals in miniscule script. He shows us one of these, and reports he has never read them. That, to me, is the sweetest metaphor. That is is wrapped in all this business about Klaus is incidental.

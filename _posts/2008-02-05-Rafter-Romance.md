If you've read a couple comments, you know the story. At least the obvious parts. Man and woman sharing apartment on different schedule. Hate and love, with love winning. 

But there's a story about stories that matters more. I'm attuned to these triple narrative devices. Its a particularly complex sort of triple symmetry fold that I first noticed in "2001." Its particularly Jewish in formation, going back 740 years that I know.

Here are the three: We have the kindly Jew who is a benevolent "arranger." He shuffles lives spatially. At the end, when things turn out well, he and his wife turn to each other and remark on how well his arranging has worked. Its the last thing we see.

We have the guy. He's an artist. That should be enough said, but his devotion to his particular story is underscored by a rich drunk matron who wants to support him. For reasons assignable only to his controlling his own story, he turns her down.

We have the girl, Ginger. Now her storytelling role is written as a stretch. She gets a job as a telemarketer where she has to convincingly read a script. It happens to be one associated with domestic life (refrigerators) which is plainly absent in the apartment where the thing is staged.

The stories are all about sex and love. Its honest, lovely precode sex.

The three stories clash in spots (some writing is involved) but braid to our satisfaction at the end. 

I believe that this triple braid was reused many times. This is the earliest I know, but I am sure readers can help me find earlier ones in film.

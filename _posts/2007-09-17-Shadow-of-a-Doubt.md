I think Hitchcock was a late bloomer, and even then he sometimes did some dreadful stuff. I just cannot fathom anyone who sees any consistency in his work, even the way he handles the camera.

"Rear Window" and "Vertigo" were masterpieces, novel cinematic narrative integrated into highly self-referential stories. I think in some way, they were the result of some happy accident and the peak of collaboration with his wife, who seems to have been the brains behind the narrative devices. Hitch seemed to have good visual intuition, novel ideas about who the camera was, and good production skills. But she was the genius.

She's not much in evidence here. Instead we have the lazy Hitchcock, the one who relies on tension. But this time, it isn't something we know that the characters don't: its something both we and the main character know. Sure, there's a small town and a small town home with evil visiting. But its hardly enough to sustain a long form film. There's one cinematic stroke only, with the rest is an effect that simply doesn't work: the tune of a waltz. We actually see the dancers at the beginning and end, and we hear the tune repeatedly. But the dancing itself means nothing; its the WORDS to the song that are supposed to matter. But if you listen to them, they don't, even remotely. This reference through three filters -- dancers, to waltz music, to the words to the music, to a point in the plot -- isn't worthy of anyone.

I'm going to recommend that you not watch this, because seeing any of Hitch's better films again would be better than seeing this one once.

Let's see. An American nation is threatened by terrorists. For seven years, the government is headed by people who believe that extraconstitutional measures are required. They detain people based on suspicion (often false accusations by enemies) and torture them because they MUST know something. These are specially created places outside the normal criminal system. It is funded and approved from the White House in the name of combating out a global movement, using soldiers and "contractors."

I've been watching movies based on this period. This is one made by Argentines, which adds something. Though the film-making is not particularly effective, it adds a genuine patina. What's disappointing about this is that though we get that the bad guys are genuinely evil men, we don't get the visceral impact of what happened. Really happened.

Spoilers herein.

I consider 'City Lights' to be a masterwork, one of the films that every literate person  must see. This film is often equally celebrated, but it seems to be a random collection of  integrated ideas to me. Some work, most don't.

The 1942 rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy. If you have a  chance with the DVD, see it in the 42 recut with no sound and subtitles.

The one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit. You really must see  three versions of this one after another. Look at the original. Then see the Robert  Downey Jr version done in 1992, almost 70 years later. Notice how much more comic  Downey's is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the  Chaplin dance. Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later, which pokes fun at  the Downey version and reannotates the original. A work of genius overlain on a  masterpiece.

Otherwise, there are better silent comedies to see. And better Chaplin.

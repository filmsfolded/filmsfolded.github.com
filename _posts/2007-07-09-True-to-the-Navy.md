Clara Bow was important. To me at least in my study of redheaded actresses and how they have come to serve as key types.

All her movies were black and white of course, but she was pictured in the fan magazines, which were far more essential then. And everyone would know she was redheaded. Her movies mention it frequently as well.

She was our first serious sex symbol.perhaps only Olive Thomas, another redhead counts. Bow was phenomenally well loved by fans, but not by Hollywood. But when talkies came along and she faltered, Hollywood pounced. Fans departed in hoards.

This was a sort of repair job. Her diction here is more confident. Its less colored by Brooklyn lowlife. She even sings. She sings!

But she sings poorly. And the movie's a dud.

But you can see how the story is designed to rehabilitate her reputation as a sex fiend. The story has her "dating" a dozen sailors on different ships, counting on them never being in port at the same time. But you discover that she is only doing this because her boss wants her too, not because she is promiscuous. And you then follow her as she discovers a "true love," also a sailor.

Watch as his manhood is displayed as battleship guns. (This was before the code.)

See? Its engineered by the public relations department. But it didn't work. She would soon be history.

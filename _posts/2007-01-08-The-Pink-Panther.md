The joke has always been simple: the French are ridiculous people, and among them their police are especially comical. This idea was only embellished by the amazing Peter Sellers. The music, generous slapstick and for the times, beautiful, suggestive women added enough to the formula to make it work. Or at least sell tickets.

Now, post 9-11 and the embarrassments of what followed on both sides between France and the US, the joke has gone flat. The French are still ridiculous, but it doesn't reward to play with it. And the incompetent police are the Americans. So the best one can do is make jokes about the old films, do some more extreme physical humor and up the ante on the sex.

They did this, then in fear cut all the sex stuff out. I'm not sure it would have saved this, but gosh, Emily Mortimer has the ability to do some pretty crazy stuff. I wonder if a restored version wouldn't be a hit on DVD (or Blu_ray).

The one interesting joke was far too complex. Our hapless Frenchie takes lessons to learn how to say "hamburger." When he tries to report that he has hamburgers in his pockets at an airport checkpoint (9-11 again), he utters the most incomprehensible stuff and gets arrested. It had so much setup in time, but I wonder how many people missed the joke because Martin's abjurations were too extreme.

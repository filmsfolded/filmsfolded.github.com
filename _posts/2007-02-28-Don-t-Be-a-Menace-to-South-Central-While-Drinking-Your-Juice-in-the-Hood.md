Nearly all movies are about other movies.

Nearly all life acts are from movies; nearly all stereotypes are from acts.

The Wayons merely close the loop: movies where the acts are stereotypes of stereotypes. They really know what they are doing, disguising it as social commentary. But that you get enough of in the first five minutes. Check out how many jokes are about acting, about every third one.

And then check out what they did next, with "Scary Movies," which takes the circle one more loop.

I admit that I'm a fan. They seem to be the only ones who can do what Zucker used to: serve up what are generally called spoofs.

I think it is because they start knowing that the target isn't bits of movies, but the bits we use in inventing the stories of who we are.

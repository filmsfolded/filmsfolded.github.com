I clumsily rented this thinking it was the Phil Dick classic. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

There's absolutely nothing interesting to be said about this film. But there might be something interesting in asking why producers think that cheesy stuff will be sweetened if it is wrapped in SciFi trappings. My own opinion is that this can be called the Star Trek effect.

Science Fiction comes in a few strongly differentiated flavors. One of those, quite distinct from the others, takes one simple idea and extrapolates it into an abstract world to explore 'what if.' For instance, a story might explore what if a completely egalitarian society existed? The placing in the 'future' is just a way of getting distance from common expectations. Star Trek was very much in this tradition. Their simple morality plays depended on a minimalization of the details of the future world. That is to say that the success of the story depended on the sets being fakey, the acting juvenile, the effects mindbogglingly stupid.

Many fans (not me actually) fondly adopted the approach. Since then, producers have blindly assumed that relaxing standards on the production is okay as long as SciFi is the style. Not so, and definitely not so in this case, where the story is the merest skeleton for moving photons.

Here's another item that appears to be simple trash, but that is worth watching if you study the state of the art in narrative folding in film today. The basic technique that you somehow develop or reference two worlds, one either "above" observing the other, or "below" as a sort of story within that folks in the story watch in some way.

The simplest form is when the story has actors in it as characters. Then there are three or four simple devices you can use. Here, it is the actor that lives IN movies W.O. By some accident finds himself in real life. The story often follows the contrast between movies and life. (Remember, readers, that this is a movie we are talking about, and the reason for such narrative tricks is to break down the wall between your world and the world on screen so that you will be engaged in the story.)

If it is movie for children's minds as here, the story always ends with our actor appreciating real life. The psychological implications of this for us are clear and we walk out of the theater happy. If it is a more serious project, like say "H Story," you'll leave disturbed, unresolved.

Anyway, this is for dopes, so it ends according to formula.

Oh, and our actor is a dog, a minor gimmick compared to all the other simplifications being shoveled around.

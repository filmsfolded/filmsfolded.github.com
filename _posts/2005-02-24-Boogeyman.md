I really liked this for two reasons.

The first had to do with the story. Both visually and storywise, this is influenced by recent Japanese horror, in particular "Ringu." The story in that case was folded to increase the audience's horror. Ringu was a film about a film. Each had its own reality, but the film within had its own somewhat inexplicable cosmology of magic.

The world of the movie we watched merged with the world of the movie the characters watched. At the same time, the world of the viewer seemed to merge with them as well. This is a well-known narrative trick in other genres and it is odd that it took this long to arrive in horror. Well, now its common: here we have an almost identical situation: we watch a story about a story -- actually a series of bedtime stories that "come to life."

For this to work, there cannot be any sort of scooby-doo ending where things are explained, perhaps by madness or someone's trickery. There isn't here. This is taken very seriously, not like say the world at a distance of slasher movies.

The second reason I liked it was the way that the images were beyond my comprehension. I'm a bit tired of horror art directors thinking they can come up with something scarier than I can imagine. In those cases, just what the monster looks like is clear, as well as what he does and why. Here, it is mostly a blur with all sorts of different impressions.

And it is nested in many movements that are too fast and short for me to make out. To get the effect, you have to see this on a big screen and sit in the right seats. There are fewer than a dozen in a standard multiplex: you must sit close enough that the screen fills your wedge of viewing so that just off the screen is just where your peripheral vision fails. That's how the effects are set up in this movie.

Understand these two things and be prepared to have your notions of time, space and causality bent.

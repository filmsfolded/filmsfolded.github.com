Spoilers herein.

The Greeks did not invent robust language, mathematics, science or self-reflection. They merely appropriated them from the Persians (and Egyptians). But they did add something marvelous, the idea of narrative exposition of these, and so we have philosophy, history, 'science' and drama which in form are all the same. Of these, drama has special power above the others, a power that continues today in film: the power to create imagination. Not respond to, but create -- that notion of the new mind was the assumption of _all_ Greek drama and underlies intelligent film today. One goes in expecting to be transformed, if even in a minor way. It was never about amusement.

Now fast forward. Because of all sorts of deviance and adaptation (itself an interesting story) of the storytelling form, we have a tradition of standup comedy. The core of standup is to ridicule others in a way that cuts close to dearly protected notions of self. This is a true art, and fully vibrant today. 

Along comes one practitioner, Ms Vardalos, with some trenchant observations about relatively ignorant immigrants in America and their amusing foibles. This follows hundreds or thousands of such similar bits. Even in this form, one can see it was a very good bit of standup. Fun, amusing, challenging, even edifying in a way. But the Hollywood maw is desperate for 'content' so it swallows everything even remotely expected to be tolerable when transformed into a film.

In this case, what we end up with is a standup routine, illustrated with pictures, similar in a way to how 'Christmas Story' illustrated Shepard's radio stories.

It shines when we hear directly from Vardalos either in word or in her double takes as she winks at the audience. But the pictures themselves aren't reproduced here as comic abstractions which would be the successful way. They are created as 'real' in the fashion of a Drew Barrymore journey of self-discovery through a love story. These people are presented as real. (The title of the comment refers to how the pictures should have been handled, in a pretend world, like 'Grease,' or after the fashion of Christopher Guest.

So what we have is a clash between the original notion of the Greeks where we vainly search for the reason we are watching, and a standup routine _about_ Greeks at whom we are supposed to laugh precisely because there is no reason there.

I suppose many people will enjoy this because they take it as simple standup, meant to amuse and possibly endear. But not me, I respect the Greeks too much.

Spoilers herein.

You know you are in trouble when Sally Struthers is the best actor on the project. But she is the only one who has any sense of timing and the only one (except Slim) to have anything like an acting career.

Here we have the heist ('90 seconds...'), the chase ('punch it baby'), the doublecross (and a couple sidetrips), and the inevitable love match.

What's amazing is how ridiculous it all seems today. The only mildly interesting thing is watching McQueen slap around his real life wife, something he apparently did often.

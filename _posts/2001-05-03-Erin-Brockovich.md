Spoilers herein.

After creating the truly exciting 'Limey,' Soderbergh puts in some time to make some money. 

He panders, he sinks, he makes a movie that wins prizes and makes money. This film was created by Roberts because she found a character she can do. He dives into the world of bitches, smarmy personal injury and corporate lawyers, and irresponsible companies.

What depresses me is not Roberts. We already know her limitations. We've heard this story many times; there's nothing new here. Roberts is no Russell Crowe; 'Erin' is no 'Insider.' (Why moviegoers celebrate this is truly depressing.)

No, my problem is that Soderbergh is an artist -- the whole society loses when he works on tripe. The framing, the editing, the abstraction is so pedestrian it hurts. Maybe this will pay for something good on down the road.

But I did get something out of it. In my rating system, for every 9, I need to find a 2. Now I can see 'In the Mood for Love.'

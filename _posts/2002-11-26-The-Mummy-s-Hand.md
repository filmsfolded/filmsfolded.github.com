Spoilers herein.

I confess I have an unusual soft spot that some films find. Its because my notion of film is an alternative reality that is created for us by some magic. That magic may not be all that understood or controllable by the filmmakers. The best films in my mind, include some reference to this magic and how the filmmaker wrestles with it. It is why I really like 'The Ring,' for instance.

This silly film hit my sweet spot. The curse activates magic that produces the movie, and begins with the rerun of the first film! I'm always conscious that Hieroglyphics are pictograms, literally the first movies. Along the way, we have a magician, and a pretty woman target. This time, the girl is actually pretty and obviously incompetent as an actor, which to me is a plus because it underscores the staginess of the whole thing. naturally the girl wouldn't fit in her (our) world.

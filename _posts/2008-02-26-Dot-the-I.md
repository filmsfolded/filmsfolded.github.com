Another clever shape. Another incompetent execution.

This follows the standard pattern for the reverse con: an elaborate movie on a movie, with turnabout at the end. The novelties here are that the con is really a movie, the movie we see, and because of that we ourselves are conned into thinking that we are seeing a romantic drama.

Its very nicely imagined, with just the right overall shape. And there are moments when the girl is effective. But all the actual cinematic qualities you need are delivered poorly. In particular, you need a rhythm-in-the-small. Everything grows from that. Its the key thing that's missing here. When you make an effective con movie, you rely on that rhythm to lull the audience, to suck them in. It isn't rocket science, and apparently comes intuitively -- or not. 

One indirect narrative lever here is that the two lovers are Latn: the guy is Brazilian, the girl Spanish, both in London. So they tried to insert a flamenco section (she's a part-time dancer). I just saw a film that did this effectively: Mike Figgis' "Hotel." That rhythm permeates and works. In fact, its a matter of genius that it unifies the thing.

No such luck here.

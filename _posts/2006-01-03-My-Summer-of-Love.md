When we enter into a film, we enter a world.

To varying degrees, depending on how fully you live, we turn our trust over to the people involved in the film, to sweep us this way and that, for whatever purposes they wish. Usually we know what to expect and that's why we arrange to be there. But expectations mean safety, and good film experiences mean you are caught without barriers.

So many films advertise one thing, even starting out as that thing, then creep into dangerous territory. You might even think of this as two women (supposing you are a man), or two faces of a woman. One approaches you with openness and innocence, beguiling you with the natural flow of how attraction, then love unfolds. This film you welcome into your heart.

It will have breezy moments and intimate ones, sometimes meditative and bit a mysterious. Sometimes even strikingly beautiful. You will fall in love with it.

The other face is one which plans. This one knows some mechanics of manipulation. It knows how to dance and sing. It can and will make you fall in love with it. Both of you will feel good, as good as if it were the real thing. No, better, because the real thing never unfolds as it should. Only the unreal seems real.

You'll fall in love with this film also, even though you know the thing is fabricated a bit. At least you hope it is only a bit. Unavoidably, as you go, you will find that the small bit you allowed becomes larger and larger. You'll question yourself and the selfishness of your lover. You'll question love. You'll want to die.

And so this little movie was conceived. It is a simple thing superficially. But what it is, and what is inside it is the same. Whether I can recommend it to you boils down to two things.

Is the thing (and the redhead who represents it) naturally perfect enough for you to give your heart without qualification?

And, is the manipulation by the selfish artist (here represented in the film by a really lovely young woman who plays the cello rather well) so rewarding, such a ride into a world of sense and warmth that the companionship is worth the cost?

If you asked, I'd have to say no. I'd probably send you to "Elvira Madigan," "Heavenly Creatures," or even "Fun." Or if you want a bit of strangeness, "Nights of Caberia," whose end is quoted here.

These 4 people (three players and the filmmaker) are earnest enough. They do have some charm, and you can spend time less pleasantly. But they just don't have the power to tackle something this huge. Love and risk is the biggest thing we have as humans, and they are not up to it.

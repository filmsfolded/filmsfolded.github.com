Some movies make their impression on you during the actual experience of watching. That's how we think it always is, but most movies enter our minds through other means. Often it is not the movie itself, but our memory of the movie. Sometimes it is the idea of the movie rather than the movie.

When you enter the world of 50's cheapo sci-fi you enter another dimension. That's because these were made to expire quickly. In those days, there really wasn't the availability of information we have now about a movie. It would simply appear in our neighborhood theaters or drive-ins and our only knowledge would be the title, a poster, perhaps a few words from the little lady in the ticket booth and what we could infer from all that, knowing the rules all these movie makers used. 

This one has it all to make a great poster: "creatures" (not just one) who are technologically created zombies; a Nazi scientist; gangsters; revenge; some amazing confusion about the relationship between atomic "rays" (here the word is the incorrect "atom ray") and electronics, and finally a threatened little girl (who isn't really).

Along the way we get rather direct references -- for the times -- to sex between our hero and his wife. And we get the odd idea of the zombies transmitting TeeVee pictures back to home base through their eyes.

That hero by the way is a "police scientist" who guesses the improbable truth early on and never, ever makes a mistake in deduction. At one point, he consults with another expert; the two call each other doctor and light competing pipes so many times that the one scene could stand as an icon for an entire period (incidentally still alive in German universities).

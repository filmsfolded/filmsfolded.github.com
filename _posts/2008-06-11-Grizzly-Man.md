To prepare for this, I saw "Into the Wild," Fitzcarraldo" (again) and "The Life Aquatic" , this latter being in the same vein as the originally intended documentary.

I have long ago accepted Herzog into my life. So it matters to me when he gets old. It matters when he stops being radical and merely talks about it. It matters when he has to go outside of himself to encounter those forces he imagines and settles on nature.

So its a death I grieve these days, and have to impose on this poor sap, His silly life matters when imposed on this grand template that Herzog has wrought.

It happens to be pretty powerful. Its real, but not as real as the fictions we used to get from this man. What we get is Herzog's unabashed admiration for a filmmaker who didn't survive. So we end up not watching this fellow, but watching Jerzog watch him. He compares the madness of the actor within ti Kinksi.

We hear his Dad's story about him. Its the story of an actor who entered a suicidal path after being turned down as the bartender on "Cheers."

Its wonderfully assembled. No one but Herzog could have done this. It puts Michael Apted's up series to shame. To shame.

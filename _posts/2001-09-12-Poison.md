Spoilers herein.

There's an approach to art which goes beyond being unique to being flagrant; beyond being controlled to excess; beyond being interesting to obsessive.

I work harder than most to find some center of interest in a film. Most films are either art because the filmmaker made them so, or they can be turned into meta-art art by a clever viewer. But the excess noted above is designed to work against this -- the filmmaker doesn't allow you to find your own center but forces you to his, designed to be as uncomfortable as possible.

Fair enough, but then the filmmaker needs to deliver something to make it worthwhile. I couldn't find anything here. It takes more than commitment, certainly more than mere unconventionality.

Spoilers herein.

This picture fooled me into liking Steve McQueen. Nearly all of his other roles repel me in their arrogance. Strutting is not acting, even in a strutting character. 

But here, the effect of his presence works, or at least doesn't distract. This movie is superior to the remake in how honest it is. All of us like to watch the master con, and especially when it involves a battle of superior wits. Here, the story is directly presented in all its complexities, although with rather hokey multiscreen tricks. The remake winks at us.

Films from this era have an unusual burden in their screwy hair styles and heavy makeup.

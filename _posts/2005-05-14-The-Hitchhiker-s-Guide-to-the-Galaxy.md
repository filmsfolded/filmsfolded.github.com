For decades, it has not been possible to write anything without acknowledging the cinematic imagination. People just like to think about most things -- most things that are associated with what they encounter -- in cinematic terms. Therefore, a storyteller needs to make a choice how to handle this.

Most simply go with the flow, and if you superficially look at most popular books, you'll see that they are just movies written down. Even your "seeing" of that fact may be itself cinematic. But some writers knowingly work against the cinematic, and that's the case with Douglas Adams. In fact, his whole charm is that he invents characters and situations that are so absurd they have no footing in prior movies. 

They are deliberately outside what we can "see," and that gives the storytelling every bit of its charm, its power. When we read the Adams "trilogy," the humor comes from the dissonance of what he presents and what we can imagine. It is this generation's "Alice."

He starts conceptually by giving us a book about an unfathomable book -- and plotwise by transmuting an ordinary situation (a yob whose home is threatened by a highway project) to a similar situation writ larger than imagining.

Adams and his readers fell into a bit of good luck in adapting the books to radio. The mechanics of impossible imagining worked even better there because you have no choice with the narrative. In radio, it relentlessly moves forward at its own pace like a fireworks display that is beyond your control. The impossible imaginings pile up, one on another in a constant stream increasing the depth of the humor. 

These ideas are conceived in Adams' mind as memes, a concept from evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins who is referenced in the various versions. He appears here in the book Dent reads at the party.

(Yes, I know it came to the public first as a radio show.)

But how to get big bucks by bringing it to the screen if the whole construction depends on it being too absurd for the screen? Adams himself said it couldn't be done without completely reinventing the concept while keeping enough of the events to appear to be the same.

But he never could break that barrier, and all the smart money in Hollywood knew it. It is impossible, not something simple like bringing a comic book to the screen.

So we get this effort from a team of second and third raters. Do yourself a favor and listen to the radio shows or even -- gasp -- read the books. You may discover a different universe..

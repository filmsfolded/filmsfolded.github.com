Spoilers herein.

'Revenge of the Nerds' meets 'Theory of Flight' with a little 'Other Sister' thrown in. Comes across as absolutely vapid. Its comic irony needs a reference, and this doesn't have one. First rule of screenwriting: tell the audience where the ground is.

Actors: Coughlin works hard at taking over the body of Stockard Channing. Swain is going nowhere, and here only gets by because her character is clueless about who she is and controlling her body.

As this is a first time director, we have few other clues about his intent. But the trend these days is to build in some ambiguity in the state of mind of the narrator. In this case, we can assume that the sterile storytelling is because it is Caroline McDuffy's dying remembrance (until the suicide) and vision of a happy ending (after the suicide). That would explain the dreamy, flat, abstract, incomplete world and the abrupt shift in tone at the suicide. (This follows the form of, say, 'Vanilla Sky,' and dozens of others.)

Dominica Swain was involved in 'Lolita,' a project whose narrator was similarly questionable. That must be why she was picked.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with your time.

I am a firm believer in the notion that actors are rare people. They have a set of challenges and concerns that are themselves interesting. Filmmakers have a different, often conflicting set of concerns and challenges. It is usually a disaster to put an actor in charge when all he knows is acting.

My favorite example is Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard," but there are tons and tons of examples. Most are like this which consists entirely of defining and displaying an interesting character. Real movielovers will find all such projects unsatisfying.

Plus, I'm not one who thinks this man is a great actor.

But there is something a bit interesting. The character here is a great artist who cannot seem to pull off the big picture, to make things slide smoothly. The actor is too, in precisely the same ways we see, as if we are watching two layers at the same time.

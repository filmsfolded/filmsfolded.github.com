Toward the end of the great period of experimentation, we have some experiments in excess.

The story here is about four great minds colliding, each intending to outsmart and probably kill the others.

One is a master forger who steals great books in order to sell copies. At the opening of the film, he steals a unique "Hamlet."

A second is a master detective, whose mere name throws everyone into a guarded position and further intrigue.

Then you have a (presumably) beautiful and intelligent woman, initially the forger's mistress and assistant. She plays all sides against the others for her benefit.

And because the US was at war with evil Germany, we have an evil German and his German henchmen. He was an unhappy customer of a fraudulent copy of the purloined Hamlet. (Interestingly, the so called Burbage Hamlet was itself stolen.) His purchase was with Nazi money that itself was stolen.

Witnessing the whole thing is the sweet, sweet fianc√© of a GI.

These four arrange to be in a grand public library (London?) just at closing time. What we see is a game of wits. People die. Books are stolen and restolen. Its a great idea, and perhaps in better hands it would have worked. But this is bizarrely confusing and uncinematic. Its interesting only in its ambitions, which as high as the best con movie.

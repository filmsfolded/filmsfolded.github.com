Spoilers herein.

In true reflection, the same DVD hosts a film and a 'making of' film, but the A and B sides are reversed - the attention is all on 'American Movie,' a vile, non-cinematic exercise in slumming.

Watch instead this little film. It is horrible. Forget about deficiencies in production values because they aren't so bad you can't ignore them. The problem with the film is that thanks to the documentary, we know that the filmmaker really is a dope - that there can be no shred of intelligence or insight here.

But if we came upon it without the derogatory wrapping, we might be able to make something of it, along the lines of 'Begotten' and 'Carnival of Souls.'

That's because the story is about a delusional man, and what we witness could be 'real' or delusions or both, or perhaps they are same, or (since the making of films is the creation of worlds) reality is a delusion. Usually, the device is more overt than just booze - the best examples employ absinthe (Dracula, Moulin Rouge, From Hell). Usually, there is an attractor for the delusion, as in 'Pi' as opposed to random drifting. Usually, there is some introduction to an external menace ('In the Woods'). Usually, sex plays a big role, as in 'Blair Witch' of the same era.

If you can, watch this with your imagination on and without seeing the documentary. At least it is honest.

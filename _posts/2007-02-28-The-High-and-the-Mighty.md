If you ever want an example of a film that has expired, and was fresh when it was new, this may be it. Wayne. You know there are still people alive who admire the man as an actor? And even as a man though he was the Mel Gibson of his era.

Well, set that aside. Wayne's role in this is fairly inconsequential, though there is an evil pleasure in watching him try to have depth, to play someone haunted by a past. 

This is a story about an airliner in trouble and the efforts of the crew to bring it home safely. Wayne is the member of that crew who though haunted, knows what he is doing. He's gotta slap some sense into the captain, you see. But that's just the wrapper. The real story is about the 17 passengers. Yes, in standard form, each has a story, most of which we actually see in flashback. All the stories are meant to pull at us, and it is here that the thing really shows its age. 

Yes, the acting is dreadful, in that "read the lines" sort of style. The staging is surprisingly inept, except for the blunt shifts between the great outside and the supposedly claustrophobic inside. And yes, each character is a stereotype that used to resonate but doesn't any more. 

Let's pause with that for a moment. "Grand Hotel," for instance had stereotypes that were every bit as obsolete, more. But the movie has such charm, we revel in those types. There's something about how true the energies are that push the levers and pull the strings on our puppets. In "Grand Hotel" those energies are true, real, we see immediately. Here, we see they are as fake as a politician's smile. Its the difference between a classic, and a previously popular movie gone fallow.

The only value this movie has is to teach us something about the fading of life through aging. Here's the interesting thing. Nearly all the stories behind our passengers are about fading through aging. Its a strange, surely unintended fold; in fact I'm sure the writer wasn't aware of how his personal concerns drive all the little vignettes. 

One character is pretty interesting, if you watch a lot of old movies. This character plays a vague role, something blurred between actor and producer; it isn't clear. In the film, his character is as insipid as all the others. But he had played Long John Silver a couple years before so successfully that he would so again and again for the rest of his life. His face and manner is so reminiscent of that persona and the written character is so weak that what we see is the actor behind the pirate only.

It happens in other films, but is striking here because everything else has faded so. The version I saw was wonderfully restored. Too bad they cannot restore the actual guts of the thing.

All the women except one token blond are redheads of various shades.

Writers, pay attention. This is a well written film. Yes, it has all the things people notice: dialog, motion, characters, arc. But it has something else on which this remark is based: good conceptual structure.

You just cannot write well unless you understand how to engineer the artificial worlds of reference. You also have to have a workable solution to the problems of introspection and folding. All writing is folded these days. All writing has some approach to introspection. These are unavoidable facts of the game.

Often, the solution is to combine the two. Thus, you'll have your characters know they are in a movie and let you know. About a third of all movies have this structure. But what if you want to be "true," or give the theatrical appearance of natural life? Well, here's one novel solution.

The world of the real requires that you define or circumscribe a world; you then define characters and let them bump around in this world according to the laws and boundaries you have proscribed and communicated. The viewer, naturally, is outside this world, so understands the boundaries.

But how then to give the riches of introspection and folding? Well, you have to define other worlds, one or two that are outside the one of the action, but which they refer to. That's what we have here.

First, note that our characters are a writer and an actor. The girls are props, just like the car, for all the work they do. Those two characters live in the little bubble world of the film. But sideways, there are two other worlds.

The first is the world (and book) that Mailes has written. The small circle of the writing we see has a simple narrative structure: Miles is our surrogate. We see what he does and nothing else. It is the most restrictive possible. But Miles tells us the sideways world of his book has a complex narrative structure that shifts and eventually escapes narrative. A simple world of writing referencing a complex world of writing. That folding without explicit introspection. A great solution.

But that's not all. On the other side is another referenced world, one that _does_ spill into the zone we see: the esoteric world of wine. In fact, the movie revolves around a scene where Miles and Myra wax poetic about the world of wine as if it were a mirror of their world with all the complexities of needs and desires.

God solution. Clever writing.

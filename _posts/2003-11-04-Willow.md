Spoilers herein.

Ron Howard is incapable of making a dark, threatening film. As a result, this one misses  the mark that 'Lord of the Rings' hits. It is not as charming as 'Dark Crystal' nor as much  fun as 'Princess Bride.' So I cannot recommend it on its merits directly. You may be  interested in George Lucas' experiments with Joseph Campbell's observations on myth,  but I'm not.

What does interest me is how he handles one, narrow archetype, the redhead. Willow  wears a red wig. The babyÂ‘s hair has been colored bright red, as has Sorsha's and the  baby's mother. (Whalley's hair is rather odd looking, because they didn't adjust the facial  makeup to match.) Heck, George even got a redhead to direct.

I believe there is something special about redheads in film. (Naturally, this says little or  nothing about redheads in real life, so no need to send me mail.) Since Clara Bow, and  then Hayworth and Hayward, the red has always carried a collection of nuances that  filmmakers can use as a shortcut.

Truffault explored this in 'Day for Night' where the magic of the women was in  proportion to how red their hair was, complicated by wigs going on and off. I think  Lucas, wanting to be a 'serious' filmmaker, was experimenting with some of these same  ideas, but with immaturity.

Howard doesn't understand how to photograph women. Even the sometimes hypnotic  Nichole Kidman looked bad in 'Far and Away.' In the same evening, I saw Joanne in  'Singing Detective,' made by someone who knew how to exploit her appeal. What a  difference!

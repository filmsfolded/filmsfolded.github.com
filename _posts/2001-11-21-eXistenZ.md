Spoilers herein.

I'm baffled by viewers who compare this to 'Matrix.' The story is quite different. The Matrix has real people living in a synthetic world; simple enough. '13th Floor' is much more sophisticated: real and artificial people living in many parallel synthetic worlds -- there is not just ambiguity about environment, but over beingness.

eXistenZ is more sophisticated yet in this dimension: synthetic worlds are not parallel but nested. Some real world exists which creates a synthetic world which in turn creates another synthetic world and so on. More: in this film, conspiracies blend levels, reversing and folding roles. This is the stuff of Phil Dick, not the Matrix, or The One, or any of that other juvenile stuff.

But there is a more fundamental difference: Films like the matrix start with a story concept, then work to tell the story by whatever visual vocabulary is current. Cronenberg starts with a specific strong vision and hangs a story on it. Clearly, his vision here is for artificially living sexual paraphernalia. These have highly erotic exteriors but disgusting, reptilian interiors. The whole film is built around this notion: prurient fiction, repellent pudenda.

And the whole thing self-referentially encompasses the audience with the final level because the film clearly shows itself to be a creation in the same mold as Allegra's. I love this stuff, if only as an intellectual construction.

But what puzzles me is Cronenberg's meekness. He knows he's a cult filmmaker, so why pander to a bunch of kids who will go to 'The One' instead? Jennifer has the guts to do whatever is required. Her presence here shows edge by reference, because we know that she would risk all if asked. But she's not asked. 

I predict that in a decade or so, as a reaction to special effects fatigue, someone with more courage will remake this with an X rating and more of an obvious Marienbad feel. Maybe you, dear reader.

Spoilers herein.

There's a lot to say about the confused stance of this film, reflecting a distinct dissonance in the American psyche: it begins with an imposed 'warning,' and tries to straddle the line between celebrating passion and condemning weakness. But I'm more interested in Brando.

He had already revolutionized film forever in just one outing, and would go on to do some very clever things. Along the way, he considers himself a lose collection of parts contained in a single skin. Each part can approach the role differently and by engineering the differences he projects the supertheatric. Each of his parts operates independently and some take over parts of his body. Here, one of his star 'component' performers is his butt. It is already showing plumpness, a matter which vexed Brando at the time.

But all in all, he manages something unknown at the time and rare since: a jazz performance among the various components of himself. Everything else (story, the actors, the situation) is simple traffic. Everything you see the characters do, Brando has his internal gang do, including the split of half the parts into a semi-competing gang. Including the homoerotic overtones.

Some cheezy backprojection and obvious stuntdoubles mar the production as much as the cold war preaching. Some believe that the icons in this film invented or accelerated some societal trends, and that may be true. But it is because the player alone gave it power.

History note: there's some credible speculation that this film supplied the inspiration to John Lennon in naming his band, the 'Beatles' as the splinter rebel half of an already rebel 'organization,' rock and roll.

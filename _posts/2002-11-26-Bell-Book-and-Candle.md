Spoilers herein.

Sometimes very ordinary films contain some interesting observation on themselves. The humor of self-observation was a cornerstone of Ernie Kovacs' life. Sadly, most of the self-referential anarchy I saw on his TeeVee show in the 50's is lost forever. But here he is, serving as a writer of a book on witchcraft who doesn't know anything about it. In fact, as the book progresses, we get the impression that it either still misses the boat or is retroactively made dumb by Gillian's spell. That's just like the writer of this film who has glimpsed something bright but somehow got it wrong in translation. That self-referential bit is interesting.

Also interesting is the use of redheads here. I believe that hundreds of such films have created (or mined) a mythology of redheads. Both Gingold and Lanchester are red here. On through to 'Practical Magic.'

There's more fun if you are willing to splice two movies together. In 'Vertigo' we first have Novak create a film-within-the-film and fool Stewart into love. Then we have the turnabout where Stewart turns director and creates a 'movie' romance out of Novak (without knowing who she is). That second film is this one, with a mirroring of the turnabout: first Novak turns the spell, and then (after being visited by the magic cat) so does Stewart.

Incidentally, this thin film has one of the cleverest title sequences I recall.

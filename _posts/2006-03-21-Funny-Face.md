This is an odd and appealing little movie.

It is a musical from an era when they were losing audiences. It features the king of such things at the time, an aging Fred Astair, at 58 and substantially heavier than his prime. He has relatively few dance numbers and none of those are clever or graceful.

Instead, this whole thing is cleverly engineered to exploit the rather unique traits of Audrey Hepburn. She was in the middle of a remarkable career based more on simple charm than presence at acting. When charm dominates the thing, you have to be extraordinary. Who else can you place in this category? Clara Bow and Louise Brooks, probably. Judy Garland when singing.

There's no one like this today, hasn't been for decades. Perhaps we filter them out, as we demand other qualities. Still, it is worth watching her to see just what it is that makes her so mesmerizing. Her face is oddly misproportioned, with a shallow jaw, heavy brow and commanding nose over that huge mouth. Its almost a caricature of a face, so that when she smiles, she lights up the whole screen.

And it seems to be more genuinely in her character than when Julia Roberts does a similar thing with a similar face. She has three faces against which she cast all her poses, all of them open to us. Smiling, crying or concerned and listening. Its an amazing limited vocabulary, though one more than Kate Hepburn managed to wring a career from.

I think this and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" may be her best films because it is as if they were grown especially for her abilities, to endear us to her through her face.

The setup in Tiffany's is complex, a call-girl in a movie who creates her own movie. This is more straightforward. She is discovered by a fashion photographer who -- in the body of the movie -- photographs her in all sorts of romantic settings. The beginning is just in getting her to Paris for this. The end is just the standard love, distance, reconciliation drill. But that second act is terrific: he places her in scenes to photograph. We see the setup with terrific clothes, the actual shooting process and then the final print. I guess eight or nine times.

Regular tedg readers will know I'm a student of folding in films. Here's an example. The point of this movie is to get us to fall in love. So while we watch beautiful, romantic photography, we have a surrogate in the film who does the same. As he watches and falls in love, so do we. A simple and effective narrative device.

Hey, and the subplot involves her fascination with the philosophy of empathy. get it?

Oddly, this conflates beatniks, philosophy and the French, which in my experience have little to do with one another. No matter, the result is an excuse for Audrey to perform -- without Fred -- the dance highlight of the film. Who would have suspected that such a gaunt frame, grown for static poses would come across so effectively in a modern routine that intends to poke fun at itself.

You must see this for the exploitation of an odd and unique face. And that dance in the beatnik club.

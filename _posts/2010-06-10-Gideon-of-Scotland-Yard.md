I fall easily into the worlds of great filmmakers. I do, even when the skills are outstripped by the ambition. I have many that I seek out.

So it puzzles the daylights out of me that I just cannot see Ford as one of the greats. Not as a filmmaker. Yes, I grant that he deeply understood the western and was able to fill it several times, counting "Grapes" as a western. But when he tries to tell a story as a story instead of a variation on something embedded in us, he falls flat.

"Valley" was nicely photographed, but was a disaster in terms of the long form. Probably the most offensive film was his "Irish" film which brought the western and plunked it down in Ireland. It was as crass as the American in the thing.

So I sought this out. This would have been a thrice matured Ford, one worried about narrative structure. Here, he walked into the only other genre as entrenched as the western, the detective story. I wanted to see. If he was a master, if he understood the form at all, we may see something extraordinary. It didn't matter whether it was a good film or well received. I expected it to be interesting to see the choices he made.

Well, there's the same spicing with humor as usual. And the same competent lighting. The actors seem at ease.

But check this out: there is no long form at all, only a sequence of episodes, some of which are loosely related. What we get instead is Ford experimenting with the pace of dialog. All of his regular films have a languid rhythm of speech. I think he made John Wayne act and carry himself with this retarded swagger. In fact, I think he created the man himself, who he routinely called stupid.

In this film, I believe Ford wanted to play with a different pace. The lines here are delivered fast. This denotes (at least here) quicker minds than usual. There surely are a large number of crimes being solved with offhanded ease. Part of the joke is how easily it appears to others in the story as well.

That may have been enough reason for Ford to make this. But it is hardly enough for us to watch it.

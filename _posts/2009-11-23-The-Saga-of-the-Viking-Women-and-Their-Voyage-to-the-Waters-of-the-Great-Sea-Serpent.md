I recently wrote an impassioned comment on the merits of 2012 as representing a cinematic advance. It has been rejected from IMDb a few times now. It celebrates the exploration of the visual vocabulary over the traditional values of what is often called the story. The story in 2012 is lacking, according to several of these traditional measures.

Okay. Here is a film that has those story values solidly. The only thing it is lacking is poetry in the lines. But the story itself is powerful and complex. 

Warriors are off, on both a spiritual quest and to provide for their partners. The women, left at home worry when they are late, so set out themselves, their own bodies on the line in a parallel spiritual/sexual quest. They know -- or suspect through legend -- that this involves a sea voyage through the watery lair of the vortex monster, a combination of phallic aggression and vaginal engulfing. 

Yes, friends, this story would be seen as deeply rooted as anything that Star Wars mined (at least initially). 

They do find their men. They do rescue them from the "caves." 

The general background is weft by some foreground fables:

-- an effeminate man of privilege is tested, found to be unworthy and is killed. His corpse is tossed into a decidedly less passionate vaginal orifice, together with a sex slave of notably discardable value. Meanwhile, a similarly effeminate Viking fellow accompanies the Viking women. He has been left behind by the real men. Short and meek, he is tested, found worthy and wins the tallest and most sexually selective of the Amazonians.

-- one of the women -- "the dark one" -- is treacherous. She casts the deciding vote to go on the quest to gain some advantage over her rival in the pulchritude pecking order. She indeed beds the king of the capturers and gains the upper hand for a while, increasing the plight of her countryfellows. But she is redeemed in the end, sacrificing her body so the others can be free. (This actress has a fascinating personal history that mirrors this role.)

-- the "king" here is more carefully crafted than a stereotype. He is costumed in the fashion of Buck Rogers' Ming, carrying a generic exoticism that cinematically evokes (at least in me) subterranean repression. He acts the part as if he is in those serials, a jailer created by fear of actually being whole.

Well, anyway, the story has heft. All else is crappy: effects and other production values. Yet among Corman quickies, this is voted the absolute worst, even with this real value, this story orders of magnitude more substantial than "2012" . There seems a Northumbrian lesson here. We need to be rescued.

Spoilers herein.

Exploitive, cloying stereotypes.

This film is what it is about, an unfair amount of attention given to the retarded daughter. The real center is the ignored people, those who fall between the cracks because others are 'special' -- people who fall between the cracks like lesbians, alcoholics, neurotics, troubled vets, people who don't have 'blessed' conditions. Juliette's job is to be so loveable that it makes us accept this unfairness. Give her a parade!

I saw this (again) in preparation for Sean Penn's portrayal of a mentally damaged person. He is the most interesting actor alive, and I wanted some background on how others handle it. All actors like to play characters that cannot be whole characters, either because they are damaged or they are actors. Every actor eventually gets around to it.

It is already the case that actors refer to prior portrayals rather to reality. Juliette gets extra points in my book for passionate commitment. She acts with her mouth, and luckily many mentally deficient people focus on their mouths as well. She comes up with some new mannerisms, at least to me. Not true, merely dramatic. I was always aware I was watching and actor. Try "I Am Sam" instead.

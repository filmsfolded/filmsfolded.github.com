Spoilers herein.

Films like this take a chance of being just too dumb and silly. This one works for me, but it likely will not for you.

The thing that makes it work for me is to constantly be aware of the context. A producer is a Monkee. A writer the guy who did 'Charlie's Angels.' The sex interest Bing Crosby's daughter! Cusak and Robbins just plain acting as goofy as they can.

Ordinarily, this excess just turns me off as in say 'me Myself and Irene' or 'Reservoir Dogs.' But this a goofy film about two guys who do what? Make goofy films. And the values they have in the film are the values of the film. I love this stuff.

I went on a binge, watching all four of the first Universal Frankenstein movies. I know that many believe "Metropolis" to be the first mad scientist movie. But that wasn't about science or scientists, but about repressive society. The "science" there was actually technology and had as much to do with things as the devices in "1984." 

This, this, I think is the first movie series where the whole point was that science was inerrently evil in its tendencies. Its different than a Faust story, where powers were conveyed for selfish ends; here the ends are discovery. Its no mistake that there's the heavy hand of religion in the village context that surrounds the man and his work.

So when I watch these, I pay attention to two things. One is how science is portrayed. Its radically different in all four. And the second is how the cinematic grammar is used to present that notion. Its a sort of hobby of mine to compare sequels and remakes.

In this second one, the nature of science has changed radically. A different writer, but the same filmmaker. Its no longer a quest for discovery; now the experiment has taken priority. We've added a new scientist, one clearly and visibly deranged. He's interested not in the discovery of the principles of the cosmos as they touch on life, but on the creation of artificial beings. 

Its completely different. The brain in this case isn't stolen at all, its created from scratch. The mad scientist creates the brain and the good one supplies the heart, still human. Its a heavy metaphor, but hey, this is billboard city. 

One wonders at the odd subtext of sex between two "artificial creatures," and what their offspring would be: natural?

The cinematography has changed as well. Now we have dark buildings with what has (erroneously I think) been termed Gothic. Well, at least there are Gothic arches. But the sets have greater sweep, and are greyer. There are fewer devices and decorations, less texture all around. The score has more frantic violins.

Its more cinematically obvious, drawing from Russians and not Germans as usually reported.

Sometimes when watching these things you can see the napkin that started the whole thing, and the scribbling on it.

Circus. Check. These are one of the most flexible and cinematic settings. We've seen many different things successfully done in circus movies. There's something about the abstraction of this type of performance in the performance of a film that works.

Mad scientist. Check. Gotta have one. Somehow he causes the terror.

Beautiful women. Check. All from roughly the same mold, literally. 

Then you can see the writer sort of disintegrating after that, because there is no obvious way to mix these three. The solution is a mess. What you have is a world famous plastic surgeon on the run for some reason, and he decides to take over a circus for cover. For cover? Then he finds beautiful, shapely young women with facial damage. He fixes their faces, and enlists them to perform in the circus. The horror? Well, if they want to leave, they suffer lethal "accidents."

Yes, its that lame, including a guy in a cheap bear suit who finishes off the doctor.

All through it, we yearn for that napkin.

Spoilers herein.

Disney studios has a simple formula which not surprisingly is similar to Spielberg's: Keep things really simple. One plot line only. Develop everything around the characters; rely on every external reference to give definition to them, do not be afraid of stereotypes. Don't make the characters work too hard to define themselves. Spend a lot of time on the score. Build everything from these two elements, characters and score. Don't take any risks with camerawork, editing, etc.

The result is a manufactured product that damages children because it blunts their imagination. Not as badly as TeeVee, but nearly so.

This little tale is stamped from an uninteresting mold. But I do find the craft of the score interesting. I do not know this fellow, but he does seem to get around. Perhaps Disney is the place where he can really shine.

When is Ms Theron going to get to use her own eyebrows?

This should be seen by any aspiring director.

Its a disaster. Yet it has a good enough set of screwball situations, and one of the best light comedy teams ever. What's missing? A pulse. 

Its something beyond merely lacking in comic timing. Creating a screwball world means the light has to crackle. Things have to move in an unreal, hyperreal way, veering both in jerks and in unexpected directions. To do that you have to have a rhythm to syncopate, to play against. And that means you have to have a director who feels the music of the story. 

So the lesson for directors here is in what not to do. This has the pace of a silent film drama. It has room to breath and us to settle into. That's wrong; our mind should be stabbing this instead of stroking it.

Its a poor state when I have to recommend that a film is bad in an educational way, but that's the case here.

Oh, the story has a mild fold in the vein of "Vertigo." A man wishes to make a story within the story and gets captured by it.

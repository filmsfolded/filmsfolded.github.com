Hitchcock invented the curious camera and produced two of the finest films in history. By this time, no one can deny that he was master of the craft, at least within his standard palette. But here he has some serious problems. I believe this picture to be a failure but fascinating in how it fails.

Hitchcock's space is one which exploits the fact that we are voyeuristic. So he developed a cinematic vocabulary that moved the narrator out of the story and into that collaborative space between the screen and the eye. He knew this well enough (at least since 1950) that he carefully chose all his stories to suit.

Every one of them involves investigation; every one employs the exploring eye within the real world and several imaginary worlds based on the real world. This is effectively the last of his films, the ones that employed his regular crew. And it is too adventuresome in the scope of what we see. The American public of '63 had an understanding of psychiatry about as unsophisticated and incorrect as their notions of nuclear energy. Nonetheless, Hitchcock tries to extend the notion of watching to the psyche using the idea that an analyst could "see" into the mind.

Our designated watcher - whose space we share - is Connery who incidentally owns a publishing house (!) and is an amateur observer of animal behavior. To make this work, the script removes all other watchers: a psychiatrist and a competing lover. The horse is even downplayed from something that "understands" her. Too bad too because the frictive sexual relationship between young women and their horses could have been used.

The structural problem is that Hitchcock was confident he could extend his cinematic grammar to describe the inner world of the mind. All we get is a Dr Stranglelove hand (same year, but Hitch saw it early) and a flash of color.

This was before Connery had his teeth fixed. Edith Head designed the costumes based on Jackie Kennedy's influence, and they had to use them even though Kennedy was killed a couple days before filming started.

Even in its day, the fakey stuff (employed so they could shoot on a set) was distracting. 

The DVD has a radical critic who says that if you don't like this, you don't like Hitchcock and if you don't love this, you don't love cinema.

Bah. If you love cinema enough; if you put as much energy into watching as went into making films, then you should be able to see this as a spectacular failure and know why.

Diane Baker is stunning.

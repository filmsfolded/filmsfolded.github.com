Spoilers herein.

This is absolute garbage. But you knew that. We are way past the point where you can deliberately make a bad movie in every way and count on us to laugh along with you. Two interesting things though.

One is the clear satire of the 'Omega Man.' Then this film became the basis for the similarly bad 'Omega Code' (and a couple equally excrescent fundamentalist products since then) except in Code the righteous christians are the good guys.

The other is the interesting is how Carpenter does his own scores. Figgis does this too, but he's actually talented and somewhat original. Carpenter's music tells us a lot about what he thinks of his film. He copies the instrumentation, the tenor and even some themes from Ennio Morricone's music for Sergio Leone's 'spaghetti' westerns. Those films did make a kind of fun at the western genre and entertained both because we got swept up in the story and were participants in goofing on ourselves for doing so. The music has a sort of lighthearted questioning to it, and ever since, anything resembling it has come to evoke intelligent self-reference within a chintzy macho context. That Carpenter uses it here means he feels he is being similarly intelligent. No chance John.

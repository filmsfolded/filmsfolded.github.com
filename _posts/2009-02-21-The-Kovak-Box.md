There is a standard form for a movie like this. Its so heavily imprinted that when you encounter a deviation, it shocks. 

We have a writer who wrote a book that comes alive. We expect that the relationship between book (the film within) and reality will be adjudicated on the viewer's side. Here it is all within the story. Instead of an overlap we weave with our genius, this movie presents us with an on screen evil genius who makes things overlap.

He literally read the book and then followed the story within.

All in all, this is a pretty unsuccessful movie, in several ways. But it still grabs us because of this strange twist on the twist mechanism.

I still don't understand the title, a rare thing for me.

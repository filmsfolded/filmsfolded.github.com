Spoilers herein.

Actors are among the most cursed beings in the world. To the extent that they succeed  as stars, they build constraints. That's because movies are always about other movies  and recognizable actors are always about themselves as we know them.

And that's doubly true for actors who rely on a gimmick, in this case choreographed  acrobatics. After a few dozen films, it must feel just like putting on a remotely controlled  suit and doing the minstrel machine bit.

I think it is possible to incorporate this in a film in a clever self-referential way. 'The  Wrong Trousers' is the very best of this, and pokes fun at the automatic nature of the  Hitchcock formula.

This about as far from that gentle sophistication as one can get. It is crude and stupid.

But yet, this Ms Hewitt is pretty good at mugging over the camp. I don't know her TeeVee  work, but it surely doesn't allow for actorly annotation like she does here. She seems to  be copying SM Geller, particularly the goofy acting-with-thighs type of poise she showed  in 'Scooby Doo.' That was pretty intelligent, though. This is not.

Spoilers herein.

I generally do not like mechanically moralistic projects like this. And Weir is a pretty heavy practitioner of the perspective. I must admit that the vague mysticism, the rambling focus, the abstract characters all are warning signs. But this film hit a sweet spot, perhaps soft spot, in my heart. It did when I saw it new, and again more powerfully when I saw it again last night.

I suppose it is a simple truth: that dramas -- even simple dramas -- can reach you if they target a domain of your life where you have experienced pain or confusion. This one targets the fear of actively combating the angst of emptiness: that same emptiness, by the way, that is crystallized and defined for us in films -- 60s and 70's art films and their children.

Max is an architect, movieland shorthand for a creative person working not just in the world of ideas but in the 'real' world. His self is restored when his fear is -- more precisely he becomes a whole being again when his vulnerabilities are recognized. This all happens against a backdrop of movieland textures: the lovely ballet dancer wife who makes her reality in performance; the obsequious psychiatrist who creates his reality in (obviously bogus) explanations; the greedy lawyer who eagerly creates a 'colored' history of memories; the religious Hispanic woman whose memory can be altered; the visit to an old girlfriend who tells him that things are not as he remembers; the architect partner whose only building we see is a 'virtual' reality.

Created worlds, constructed remembrances can only be pulled off if a level of self-confidence is guaranteed. The dynamics of openness, pain and earnestness are what's referenced here. Bridges is not a great actor, but he is intelligent. He knows how to reflect the fabric that Weir is weaving in his internal drama. Did precisely the same for the Coens with 'Lebowski' but there with comic overtones. No less visceral.

What makes this work, the one episode that will stick with me forever is the 'crash' at the end: the destruction of our vehicle -- the ripping open of our container. It is brilliantly cinematic. It is why film was invented, and how they sometimes invent us.

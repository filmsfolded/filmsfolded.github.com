Spoilers herein.

There will be some who see this as stereotypical baggage, because these men -- so far as they say anything -- do a stepinfetchit bit. Quite apart from the Jim Crow situation in real life, these guys on screen are no more cartoonish than anyone else on film during this period.

I assume that this was made for black audiences. The story is a thin disguise for putting on a show which likely differed in a very few details. The camera is static and unimaginative. Very few setups were used. But what dance! What energy! This is short, but the passion of these guys needs to be appreciated.

I thought I saw quite a few moves that Michael Jackson used.

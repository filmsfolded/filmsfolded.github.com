This picture was made as another try by Arnie to convince us that he is a smart guy. He's been going down the list with attempts, comedy, drama... In the Last Action Hero, he tried something -- self-reference -- that was intellectually ambitious, and clearly beyond his reach.

Here he tries religion, but hedges his bet by wrapping it in action. He hires a very artsy director, and a couple accomplished actors, perhaps thinking they will lift his boat. But no chance. This film is dumb, and so is Arnie, and the stuff that is done well just amplifies that fact.

The DVD commentary is a hoot, with every third comment being a compliment on Arnie's intelligence, his acting skills, his commitment as an artist.

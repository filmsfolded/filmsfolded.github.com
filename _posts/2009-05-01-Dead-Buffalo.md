I follow this young filmmaker's work. He makes it easy for me and there are rewards. This is his latest.

I like this guy's intuitions, and think he will so something important some day. These projects are his way of working with us to find out how. 

If you seek this out, you will find two things that are excellent: the general idea for the story and the way the camera is used. The strong intuitions I mentioned are how he coordinates the components of the scene: the lines, the camera movement and the edits. Its as fluid as one of the serious greats. Its really quite rare, and will pay off.

The problems are that the actual lines are poor, and the production and acting aren't at the same level. The score is as unconnected with the cinematic vision as the camera is connected. In other words, everything you actually see is strong. Everything you hear is not.

I usually like ambitious stuff, even if it is done imperfectly. But here we have a simple idea executed extremely well. I'm particularly attuned to films which reference the fact that regardless of what is on the screen, the viewer invents most of what he sees.

In this case, a girl draws a world she inhabits, shifting from the "real" world and back as the two appear to merge. It has an ending like "Heaven" (expect for a dastardly compromise in the last 30 seconds) and a beginning derived from Alice in Wonderland.

The acting to my mind was utterly unrealistic, but that's entirely as it should be.

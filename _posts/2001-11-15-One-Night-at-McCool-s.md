Spoilers herein.

This is just the kind of film you watch where attention to the mechanics is more attractive than attention to the story itself.

The original idea is so attractive, I'm angry that it was watered down so:

--Start with a heavily visual Rashomon fabric. Visually different with unique hairstyle, Jewel personality and clothes for each point of view.

--Center it on a sexual personality that by itself charms, draws the viewers into the role as one of the confessors. Balance the telling of the story with the happening itself in such a way that it is clear that there is a battle between versions. The game is which one of the listener's (not the teller's) versions the viewer chooses. One will win (Douglas) and as surrogate for us, will get the prize.

--Make it highly visual, expertly edited noir comedy that end on the noir (or else it has no noir at all).

--Fill it up with comedic actors as the three manipulated men, and allow them to be as funny as they want.

But they blew it, as Hollywood always does because of the evolution toward the bland that gets laid on any director that is not powerful enough to push back. So we get:

--The three visual identities are merged into one. (Check the DVD extras to see the original notions of the blond, black and redhaired Livs.) A mistake.

--Liv has a lovely face and she knows how to mug seductively. But the role requires a physical actress. She has neither the instrument nor the talent for this. A mistake.

--They took out the battle among the three listeners for the narrator's attention. Another mistake.

--They reshot the ending because test audiences were leaving without smiles. (Again, see the DVD.) Market forces are a compelling driver, but this change enviscerated the noir setup elsewhere throughout the film.

So we are left with the question: why make the film in the first place? The film comedy business is evolving. No formulas work anymore. Films like this are cheap, and 20 experiments will pay for a single hit among them. So why not take chances?

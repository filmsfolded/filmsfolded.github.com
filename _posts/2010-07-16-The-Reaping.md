I can imagine the pitch for this, knowing that it was manufactured to that specification:

 Inherit a ready cosmology from the Bible. It has quite few, contradictory ones. Pick the one most amenable to special effects.

 Use the supportable stereotype of paranoid, fundamentalist Southern nitwits.

 Adopt the evil girlchild persona from so, so many horror movies.

 Pay a decent, known actress. 

 Introduce a possible interracial romance.

 Layer past memories, prophetic and hallucinogenic visions. 

 Engineer the twist that modern audiences demand but make it sixth-sense-severe.

All that is too much engineering to work in a Hollywood production. I'll only comment on the last two.

The film overall failed for me. I just cannot get excited about the strings they tried to pull, from the child to the hicks to the supposedly spooky bible. But the narrative twist sure as heck worked. We spend 96% of the movie following some sort of nonsensical prophecy about a satanic cult producing a child that brings Satan to the Earth, triggering the end times. Our intrepid, on screen detective may be the designated angel to save the world, based on a price she has paid. 

This child brings the plagues, in prescribed order. Townspeople know what is up, take their bibles and guns to kill the girl and are thwarted. Now it is up to Hilary's character. Magical storms swirl as they confront each other and the child seems doomed at the "angel's" hand. But then Hilary's angel character has a revelation. The child is God's angel. Most of the town are satanists. Like "Wicker Man," Hilary had been selected to be tricked into murdering the girl. Seems that all the satanists are first-borns and for some complex reason they cannot kill the child; only someone who has lost all faith can.

But Hilary's character sees the truth, lets the girl go and the last plague is visited: death to the firstborn. It is actually a pretty good reversal on paper. The effects and the stereotypical, unimaginative settings ruin it all. But the idea is cool.

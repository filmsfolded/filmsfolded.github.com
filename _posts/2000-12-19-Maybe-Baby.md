Yet another film script about writing a film script. The extra stuffing here is the emotional grist of barrenness spiced up with sex humor. It is crafted according to film school standards, and adds not much to that standard. The interesting element here is Joely Richardson in the central role. She's an interesting actress. I first became aware of her in 'Drowning by Numbers,' which is a milestone in cinema. 

That film was a study in structured quirkiness. The Australians have built an entire mass subculture on quirk, so it makes sense for them to build a quirky tone around Joely. I don't know her range, but she does know how to pull the space around her into a humorous twilight zone. Some actresses (Gwyneth, Michelle) focus their energy into first building a face of charm before they apply whatever character on top. Joely has an equally odd face which she has the courage to apply directly to her acting.

The last time I saw her was as a background painting in the inexcusable 'The Patriot.' A failure to employ her well is a continuing blot on that film.

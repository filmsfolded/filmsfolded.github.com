Spoilers herein.

Scott understood that this was not a film about a simple character, which is why he was  attracted to it and others turned it down, unsophisticated actors like John Wayne and  Robert Mitchum.

He knew that this was an opportunity for an actor to play a man who was playing a role  - a role that was foreordained because he had played this role in past lives.

He knew that it was not about the man, but most viewers will not. The DVD has a  commentary, in fact, by the president of some Patton appreciation society who fawningly  prattles on in a parody of patriotism.

Scott knew that is was not even about himself as an actor, which is why he refused his  Oscar. It was about stepping into the cloak of echos, of animistic determinism, of Persian  notions of self. It was about visiting borrowed beings and using them to destroy  borrowers of lesser beings. It was about acting as life and life as a command  performance. That?s why we first see him performing on a stage.

Jerry Goldsmith, who did the score, was also tuned in to this. Check out his Patton  theme. Echos. All of Schaffner's films have this subtext.

Ted?s Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.

Spoilers herein.

By 1962, Kurosawa had already reinvented film, and this was slowly changing the world's imagination. But Japan's film industry was every bit as blockheaded as Hollywood, and he found himself indentured to a system that forced him into ever more popular tripe. Kurosawa did not write this. It was instead put together by others out of crowd-pleasing formula.

It blazes no new ground in visual narrative. It is not intelligent. The visual strokes do not relate to the story at all, something Kurosawa invented. What we are left is with is a stupid story filmed by a master. In fact, freed from worrying about things that matter more, he is able to spend time with the framing. And his highly refined compositions show it, including many that use his characteristic multiple planes. Even Mifune is reduced to the type of self-parody we would celebrate in the later Tarantino.

This is therefore a sad film, especially since we know what the next decade would bring for Kurosawa.

What's interesting is the minor mutiny that Kurosawa and Mifune conspire to create under the surface. They started their partnership making intelligent films behind the backs of the studio bosses (and much of the public). But by this time were reluctant guns for hire, walking through various situations that may or may not captivate them.

See this story for what it is: Kurosawa as ronin, not giving a noh about the local boss but willing to fight for him as he wanders through his territory. Willing to be the footstool, so long as he can send chrysanthemums down the stream.

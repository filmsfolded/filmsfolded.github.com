Spoilers herein.

There are films that are merely illustrated stories, and there are films that are centrally cinematic. There are so few of the latter, especially as mainstream products, that we should celebrate when one comes along. This one gets low marks from a lot of people because it superficially is dumb. After all, it is an excessively violent action movie with the double burden of two of the most offensive muggers working today. It has no sex.

But it has a cinematic soul. There are parts of this that are perfect. Parts of the 'When you wish' sequence go over the line and the boat chase is mundane, but the church sequence and two others are as visually poetic as it gets without a story on the big screen. 

The story is just an excuse, and is a simple construction, but some care has been given to details within those broad stokes: the face-wipe gesture, the 'identity' of Dominique (of Dolores Haze fame, possibly the most invented identity in all literature -- Lolita), the cruel jabs at religious watering down of powerful myth, the careful cooptation of the Frankenstein ploy.

It also has Gina Gershon in a relatively minor role. She's been worth following since 'Bound' -- she's not a great actress, but she uses her neck in interesting ways.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

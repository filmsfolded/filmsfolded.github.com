Spoilers herein.

This is an ordinary story told in an ordinary way. Pretty tepid stuff.

As the story goes on, Charlie's hair gets less and less red, as if it had started browning from her first experience with Rainbird. The red was stolen by Dr. Wanless and transferred to his wife. You can see the same effect with Mary Conant as well.

Dennis Hopper here in his most natural role since 'Apocalypse Now' both roles are him. He has a really cool negotiating session with the dastardly Rainbird. Its a very clever piece of time folding. How do you try to coerce with a man that knows the future.

Other than that, this is a waste of time.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

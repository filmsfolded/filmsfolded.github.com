No nation is the subject of so much lesser and stumbling tragic fiction as Ireland. I suppose that's the price to be paid for producing some of the world's few literary masterpieces.

So we have one after another journalists-who-would-be-writers parading through the bog in search of a surrounding so infused with misfortune that they can find a few usable nuggets just lying around. So it is here. Adian Quinn wanted a tragic role, so he had one created expecting us to sit through it. He even frames it with James Caan on a similar search, and we can only sit like Caan's bored history class.

There is only one small sparkle in this whole dreary affair. There's no sense of film; the story makes no sense, has no soul; the acting is distant. The one sparkle is a scene so finely exaggerated it must be seen just for the few minutes it affords. Stephen Rea is a visiting priest, so full of brimstone, repressed sexuality and a need to damage other lives that even in its excess it enthralls. This is what the whole film could have been if it had the guts.

There'll be no cinematic wonder lost if you see this on tape on a TV.

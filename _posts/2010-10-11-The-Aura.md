I am trying to understand the contribution of sound to cinematic narrative. It seems multidimensional compared to the linearity of the delivered narrative and three dimensional nature of the cinematic vocabulary. Though the detail we need to sustain narrative is missing, music (and sound generally) can form the skeleton of a rich narrative. It will take me some time to wade through this with the Zimmers and Elfmans distracting.

Meanwhile, here is a film that understands the power of silence. 

The story revolves around man who takes dead things and makes them look as if they were alive and making noise. He himself has seizure disorder and often crosses that boundary between silence-blindness and speaking-seeing. In between, right on the edge of that transition, is "the aura," a strange supernatural state where dreams diffuse. Some people experience it as colors or sound; range pretty much covers everything. This man experiences it as a narrative, which form the "film within." 

Spanish-speaking filmmakers have a long tradition of interweaving realism with other layers, sometimes unfortunately called magical. The evolution of this explores all sorts of folds, and I believe that the possibilities are roughly the same explored by those trying to mix on-screen singing into a realistic narrative. It is not a reach to see the taxidermy and abandoned wife segments as more "real," and the heist segments as "in aura," with a transitional segment early in the movie where the heist is imagined from the alert state. Describing it this way does not do justice to the construction.

The inner bits are noir-driven, meaning that there is an inevitability, a conspiracy of the cosmos. It has gambling, accidental engagements, partial but not adequate glimpses of what is going on. This filmmaker's last film worked this sort of thing with the imposition of the con game on "reality." Here he is much more masterful, seamless enough that he is able to give us both noir and an outer awareness, that recognition of the aura.

If you think of it, the power that noir has over us is the way we see ourselves as helplessly buffeted by forces. But the form has become so formulaic that it loses its effectiveness, its art. This solution, what this filmmaker has done here is brilliant. Unfortunately forces beyond his control took him away from us into his own world now.

The effectiveness of the noir dynamic here is accentuated by what he takes away. He takes the sound away. There are long pauses here. Time stands still for the viewer while the world moves. It is more effective than any score could be.

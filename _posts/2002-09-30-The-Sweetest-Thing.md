Spoilers herein.

I'm attracted to comedies that miss but show extreme commitment of the Marx Brothers anything goes discontinuity type. Whether the jokes are about bodily fluids is beside the point. This kind of humor is all about timing, and framing and setting the tone visually as a romp. This picture fails for the same reason as 'Freddy Got Fingered.' The enthusiasm and commitment wasn't matched by skill.

Watching this is a film school lesson: some film humor can be invested in the performer. Jim Carrey or Robin Williams can do bits that make us laugh regardless of how framed. But the stuff attempted here is situational humor. The girls are not the jokesters, they are the dupes. We need careful shaping of the situation and then their reaction. For instance, we have a long setup where Ms Blair takes a dress to the cleaners with an embarrassing stain. The proprietor is a family friend, then in comes a class trip, and her third grade teacher, then her priest. The setup builds and builds faster and faster and then, what? the scene ends. No joke, no reaction, and no laugh.

The funniest actress in this film is Parker Posey. Check out what she's done for Chris Guest, to see how she works as the target of the joke and then plays under the reaction. The other three can prance well enough, but just don't know what the director seems to have in mind. 

Carmen acts with her neck, Christina with her shoulders and Selma with her forehead. Take a look. Parker acts with her chin. Better for comedy.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

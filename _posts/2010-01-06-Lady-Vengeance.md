What if you decided that you were tired of making energetic films, that you knew how to do that. What if you looked deep into what you believed to be the soul of man and Korea, and decided to take a chance exploring that? What if the power of women confused you because it did not fit the cinematic model you had perfected, one of reasoned outrage and focused plan?

Suppose you wanted to explore this in a revenge film, but one focused on how a woman would work as representative of a people. You might start with "Twelve Angry Men, " run it through a "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern" filter and aim for something like "Murder on the Orient Express" in flashback.

You would want to do the obvious: enfold brutality into beauty, saintliness, global admiration. You would want to frame the thing as a struggle between Christianity and Buddhism. That means of course that you will start with overt references, like our heroine being released from prison conflated with the virgin birth of Jesus, the intercession of the preacher as a new threat and the differences in what justice is. You'd take that and slowly show how a traditional revenge movie (the Bronson type which you just made) is guided by reason and tokens, while the female-Korean-Buddhist rivers would drive from outside the personal furnace. Your whole cinematic and narrative flow would move from that old mold to the new. Actually of course, your new cinematic approach would simply reclaim what was there all along, the original forms of the cosmos taking revenge on the foreign.

There would be a literal stealing of children, killing and rescuing. This would be wrapped in issues of different culture and language. Wanting to make the sort of introspective film the Australians do these days, you might even feature Australians in this role. 

The thing would be designed to frustrate fans of your previous film: one that had mystery but the contract was that it was explicable and all would be revealed. You'd take your narrative in all sorts of directions that don't reinforce a solution. Here we have all sorts of prison dynamics and mininarratives that flummox the Christian flow, but are simply part of the seeming accidents of life. These literally linger on plot elements and personal dynamics in the same way that the camera in "12 Angry Men" wanders and discovers.

Myself. I think this is an achievement. It isn't in the category of Greenaway or Kar-Wai Wong. But they don't have to film from the previous film. 

Incidentally, the "folding" mechanism here has to do with films she discovers and shows to a select audience. We enter the last 20 minutes with that audience to participate in the killing: wearing plastic to protect us from the blood.

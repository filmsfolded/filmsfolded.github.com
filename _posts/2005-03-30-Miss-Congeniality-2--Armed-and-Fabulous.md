I found the first Miss Congealed fascinating. As a movie, it was a pleasant enough space filler. But what it had going for it was the sheer excellence of engineering: engineering to Bullock, I mean. 

Every actor of limited range knows the story of Kate Hepburn, how she wore out the one thing she could do, then engineered a vehicle ("Woman of the Year") which folded that one thing into an appealing enough character that she could take from film to film without anyone really noticing.

Bullock is an actress of extremely limited range who deliberately found a perfect film in the first one. Like all carefully engineered vehicles, it exploits "folding," where the performance of the film (which has Bullock pretending to be a cop) contains a performance (the cop pretending to be a contestant on stage).

The idea behind folding is that we the audience enter the film and increase our closeness to the story. That's important for these kinds of projects, the ones that Drew Barrymore does best these days.

This sequel has folding as well, but on steroids: Bullock as poster girl (mild folding) playing a man playing a woman (serious folding), with her in a "Priscilla of the Desert" costume in the final sequence. This sequence involves yet another "play," the Treasure Island skit in Las Vegas.

But along the way, they forgot to write any competent lines to fill this vessel. You can see that Bullock was in charge of the script and hobbled it through her desperate move to create a "Woman of the Year."

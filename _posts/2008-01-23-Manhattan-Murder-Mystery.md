One of the greatest pleasures I have in film is imagining - and therefore internally watching -- films that aren't there. Orson Welles is great for this since all but two of his projects were tinkered with by dummies and many others never made it to us. Also in this category are films that you know the filmmaker had in mind, perhaps great films, but that because of lack or talent, skill or resources came through imperfect.

Its a sort of detective story, a sort of scholarship into uninstanced imagination. One of the most interesting of these is the missing mystery in "Annie Hall." It was originally envisioned as a massive collection of narrative devices, a survey of storytelling tricks, each one elaborated cinematically and perhaps folded into some of the others. We know from Woody since that he is meticulous in his examination and categorization of these effects, and apparently he had too much to cover. So (as the story goes) his producer and some friends who form valued counsel talked him into jettisoning the mystery and editing to a romance.

What we ended up with is a relatively coherent collection of introspective narrative devices. But we wonder what the mystery was and how it could have fit in. Supposedly the missing piece has been reworked for this. It also is a tour of noir reversals and cinematic tricks. Its not as clever. Its not as coherent. Its not as invisible, which is what you want in a Woody project. You don't want just bones and scaffolding; you want a real being.

But its enjoyable, partly because it itself explores what the missing piece of "Lady from Shanghai" would have been. But you know, the missing mystery I imagined from Annie Hall? It was better.

I always like restaurant table talk about movies in movies. He blows that up in "Melinda and Melinda." All Woody things are connected. Some day someone will create a web service that allows someone to easily make and see the connections. Won't that be nice?

Spoilers herein.

Just a collection of skits, mostly misses. But here is Jamie Lee as a redhead. Pretty much the whole enterprise revolves around her reactions. This is a very specific type of film humor. Pretty hard to do it seems. Wonder why Jamie Lee never was a big success, given how she holds this together, keeping up with Cleese and Kline.

My theory is that some actors depend on very specific conditions to thrive. Just look at her few scenes without Kline or Cleese to see how ordinary she usually is.

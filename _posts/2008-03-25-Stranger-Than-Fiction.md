This is something of a failed project because the last two of the three acts are stunted.

The first act concerns our hero discovering that in addition to being 'real," he is a fictional character of a writer in the same reality.

Unfortunately, someone decided that this should be lengthened and exaggerated because of the comedic benefit. I am sure the project did not start out this way.

The second act is the most powerful in terms of the folding. Here we learn of the beauty of his independence, but that the book with his death is "so beautiful" that he really should die to preserve the beauty of the work. The laborious introduction of Hoffman's character in the first act is so that he can render this judgment. Its pretty powerful stuff, and after reading the book with his own death, our hero agrees.

The third act is a sort of resolution based on the realities of big movie requirements for a happy ending, with the guy getting the magnificently appealing girl. But its rushed and something of a mess. Its obviously grafted on. The narrative connections are broken; the rhythm is all wrong. While Emma's book is declared "not very good," the movie is pulled the same way in an ultimate folding.

Well, I guess we should celebrate any sort of overt folding in films, even second-rate ones. 

I have to remark that Hoffman is the best I have seen him since "Rosencrantz." He used to be a fine actor. And Maggie, whose character makes delicious things, is herself a delicious confection.

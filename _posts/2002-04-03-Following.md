Spoilers herein.

'Memento' struck me as intelligent and clever.

It folded time in a way that supported the narrative self-reference. The device of the text on skin spoke to the vigorous selfexamination of what it means to act. Seeing this predecessor disappoints, as does reading the comments that think these films are in any way similar.

Oh, this has some time shuffling. But it has nothing whatever to do with the story, which is a relatively standard triplecross surprise. Here, it is an aid to the storytelling. But 'Memento' spoke to deep issues of narrative and representation: the story was a throwaway -- just an excuse.

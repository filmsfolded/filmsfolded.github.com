Some films hang on the writing alone. Of those, very few impress. That's because when you commit to the word, everything else must be sublimated. No cinematic flash, no extraneous acting effects, no character for character sake. Just riveting relentless movement.

I can only imagine how difficult it is for the director to toe the line on this.

Great storytelling. See it. So many clich√©s are avoided: a bunch of coincidences and unlikely connections add up to a huge artifice that is taken in unlikely directions from the very first crackling moment. 'Usual Suspects' was more clever, this is more practiced.

But not particularly great movie-making. That's because while the storytelling is fresh and unexpected, the eye is not. It is hard to be novel with guns in Mexico -- these images are pretty well-worn. (The Butch and Kid stuff is a mite heavy, and to make them gay!) So we have here the compliment of 'Snatch,' all story, no image.

Caan looks pretty uncomfortable, which is apt.

Except for two elements, I found this among the better of the David Suchet versions. Its a remarkably complex mystery and it is sketched out well enough. The business about the open appointment book could have been made clearer earlier. 

The characters are less outrageously drawn than usual. Its perhaps less entertaining that way, but when it is done, it distracts from the core value of the project. Timing, diversions and deception and incredible planning -- all hallmarks of the best Christie. The sets astound me every time I see these. Its amazing the trouble they go through on exteriors. 

What I disliked was the way they bludgeoned us with the title. In the books, such things are subtle. Here, perhaps 20 times we see two schoolgirls playing hopscotch, often overlain on events. Its absolutely frustrating, and one wonders about how stupid the adapter thought we were.

The other absolutely superfluous think involved lengthy old newsreels about the prince visiting India. It was of no consequence in world affairs then, some nitwit on tour. But it has nothing whatever to do with this story. None. None whatever.

Now that I write about its flaws, maybe this isn't among the best.

Only in the US would it be possible to make a movie based on the premise that the local police, men with guns and power, are primarily interested in jerking the public around.

In their defense, this was released before September 11, and who would have guessed the power that these stereotypes would take in a slightly different context. A context where a Pakistani copy of a western cartoon calls for death is different indeed.

Well, it ain't a funny idea now. But all would be forgotten if there were one really good joke in this. "Dude, Where's My Car" had one. But this didn't have a single moment worth remembering.

There is one interesting thing about this movie, and you don't have to actually watch it to appreciate it.

The movie is about a group of pranksters that sort of make stuff up as they go, but in the large they are incompetent. Those same guys are the ones that collectively "wrote" this movie, with the same results.

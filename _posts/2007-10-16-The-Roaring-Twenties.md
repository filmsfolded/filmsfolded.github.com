This is a very strange movie experience.

Its a traditional gangster movie: good guy turns bad but is redeemed -- oh and he incidentally has a love that he's not good enough for.

And it features both Cagney and Bogart when both of them were tired of playing gangsters and their manner is tired too. These guys have no pizazz, no life. That makes the next fact heavy: its designed as if it were a documentary both on the times and this fellow's life. It is partly newsreel in fact, with that common voice-over style that even by then had become so distinct.

One thing that's unsettling is that there's supposed to be a distinct separation between the time of the movie and the time of the story in the movie. We're supposed to be looking back, from a time of angst to a time of sensual freedom. The problem is that its about 70 years from the time of this, and we miss the jokes, the distance between these two. It was supposed to be a play where the nature of the play-acting was obvious. Its gone now.

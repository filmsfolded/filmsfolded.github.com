They threw a lot of elements into this pot:

-- A Heidi-like redheaded teenager in the flush of sexual wonder, played by an actress with the florid name of Honeysuckle

-- Significant reference to and use of Romeo and Juliet (including the title)

-- Ripe Cherries by the bushel, directly conflated with menarche

-- An illicit love affair (that doesn't directly involve the girl) in the English country

These mix to make something tolerable that otherwise would be dreadful. The device is overused: the girl is sent to the country because of the war. She is the reporter, presumably writing as an older woman. We see what she witnesses.

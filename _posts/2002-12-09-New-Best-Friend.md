Spoilers herein.

I'm absolutely amazed at how many bad films seem to have had good beginnings. The scriptwriter is a graduate of USC Film School. And while her first script is unimaginative, it has many intelligent notions: the self-reference of the film-within-the film which here cleverly also becomes the fulcrum of the plot; the 'Rashomon'-like alternative truths; the murder by failing to act; the device of invented identity (an actor's dream). It even has the literal folding metaphor (in the paper). I believe that this very script with a few adjustments, and in the right hands could have made a very good movie.

But here, the director is so clueless and so unskillful, one's eyes water. I cannot understand why such people expose themselves like she does in her director's commentary. Without that damning commentary, we might blame this on lobotomized studio executives.

But there is some fun to be had here. You can watch many films at three levels at once: the film that is unfurled, the drama that the actors bring from their 'real' lives (for instance any Arnie or Wayne movie), and the inference that comes with the actor from prior roles.

This last is the most fun. Ms Doubtfire is really Mork. Julianne always has shades of Yelena, Cate of Elizabeth.

In this case, we have two of the most interesting film girls I know. Dolores Haze (Lolita) already was the center of imagined reality in film even in the novel. Dominica didn't create a deep character -- that's the point -- instead her fey, passionate androgyny gave a face to the fantasy. Wherever she goes in film now, she carries that magic.

Mia Kirshner's fate is more directly cinematic. Possibly the best written film of the 90's was 'Exotica' where she plays sort of a folded Lolita, a palliative fantasy. Putting the two on screen together -- regardless of how inepty -- has real power for a filmlover.

Ted's Evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

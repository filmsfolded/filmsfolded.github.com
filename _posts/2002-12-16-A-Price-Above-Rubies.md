Spoilers herein.

This is a simple 'repressed woman carves out a future' film. The normal form of this genre is to first describe the confining setting. Any religion or 'traditional' ethnic group can be displayed as stifling, even evil. This time it is the Hasidic Jew's turn.

But this fork of the genre demands a happy ending, as opposed to the smaller Bergmanesque fork that actually tries to reward the viewer's exposure to pain by insights. Here, the woman is stressed, fights back and sees a rosie future. So the evil environment has to have at least a couple friendly characters.

As an example of the genre, this one is pallid. It has the metaphor of a jewel finding a setting that superficially looks passionate. That metaphor is pretty thin compared to great films, but it at least puts it a step ahead of the norm of this type. 

There is a remarkable score: faintly derived from klezmer, it has both a quirky humor and a curious promiscuity. Apt, and I liked it.

But if you wish, you can get a little more value out of this than was put into it by seeing it as 'Nurse Betty' meets 'Dancer in the Dark.' That's because there is an alternative reality that Sonia shifts in and out of. Its because her notion of beauty is based on a promiscuous sensuality, contrasted to the exploitive, damaging sex the males give back. 'You had me at Â‘hello',' but there's a disagreement on what 'had' means. Talmudic arguments could have been used to enrich this situation, but it was avoided. In fact, the Jews here might as well have been Scottish Presbyterians or New England Puritans.

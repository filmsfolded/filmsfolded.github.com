Around the time this was made, I went to a "modern" concert. The "musicians" merely beat some members of the audience with their instruments. There was noise, there were instruments and people calling themselves musicians. Was it music?

Concept art has to be clever and profound, or possibly overwhelming or enchantingly strange. Just giving the audience the finger shouldn't be enough. This is a film only accidentally, a camera only happened to be the handy instrument.

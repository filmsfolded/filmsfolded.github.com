Often, my movie selections are driven by cathartic needs. At present, in my country the political dialog is controlled by religious zealots who profess a higher ground, but always, always, are discovered to be weak precisely where they shout strengths. 

This is a well conceived story, and was cinematically ambitious, but poorly executed. Most folks will know it: a "jungle" setting, complete with pounding, sexual drums. Two European groups stranded together unwillingly by contrived plot devices. One represented by Joan Crawford's character lives by sense. The other, headed by dramatic bluster by the Huston character is a religious nut, there to convert the natives. He decides to focus on Crawford. Following Maugham's cosmology, he will break because he is wound so tight, his brittleness is too much. He -- you probably know -- completely breaks Crawford's prostitute, and apparently wins. But in his gloating, he admires his new creature too much and attacks her newly innocent and vulnerable self sexually. Ashamed, he kills himself as the drums get louder. 

There were several of these films before the whole movie business was repressed by Huston-like characters (the same as we still have). They all have this same notion that is the real disturbing thing, that somehow the nature of woman is closer to nature, and that the essence of nature is passion. Also that the "lower" races embody this as well. 

So even though in the story, "the man" gets his due, it always because of a powerful machine that I think is a repellent idea. Urges and tension are more complex and real than sex, and whatever fabulations we concoct about sex and race. Crawford always thought she failed in this character, and I can see why. Even with a truly talented actress, and she wasn't, it would be hard to get inside what is really going on here. Because there's no there, there. Just another layer of sanctimonious management of the mystery of life.

What a pleasure it is to surf cultural tides. But when it comes to this material, I'm missing the most important part. 

That's because I wasn't born into the British class system, so cannot appreciate the subtle play with accents that films like this depend on. 

I would really like to have someone teach me about this before I die, even though I know it can never have the same deep visceral pull it must have on natives. So I know that even though this has plenty of universal charm, I'll never enter the inner circle of viewers. I suppose it is the same for any film. Of those who are touched, there will be some smaller group who understands the special language being used.

I read of a recent Almodovar film, there was the matter of training a Mexican actor in Continental Spanish swagger. Its a different kind of bodily aggression, the subtlety of which eludes me. But what of these grammars that are not ethnically based? What of those that have to do with allusions to shared dreams and structures of imagination that very few share? Its absolutely fascinating, especially when the film has other attractions that makes people think they understand others that "like" it.

This was created by a nation at war. There are all sorts of subtexts. The innate goodness of the people. The overlapping of class commitments to the common cause. The childishness of war. The recognition that the root of the society is in women, and sex. 

The celebration of a legacy. The intercession of God on the side of goodness. The acknowledgment of the importance and shared goodness of Americans. The journey, defined several ways, conflated.

The structure of the thing is remarkable. There's a mystery film embedded inside. Its a strange token of the form because there is only one suspect; the question is why. We learn why before we get the basketful of other payoffs, with parades, restored loves, and God's smile. 

It has to do with dirty tactics in the name of saving a society. 

Dirty tactics like firebombing civilians.

Archer projects are always worth watching, manylayered and deftly structured. This is among the best.

Spoilers herein.

About 7 years ago, I was involved in a project that led to a briefing by perhaps the world's top theorist in marketing through sex. I was amazed at the articulation of this science. I wonder if this film was crafted with as much sensitivity to that science as was the similar investment in 'Charlie's Angels.' I think perhaps not to judge from the result.

This is a sexless, funless death march every bit as bad as 'The Avengers' and for very much the same reason. As it turns out selling with humor allows for a lot of slop; selling by sex requires consummate artistry and has to be just perfect. That's because sex (the popular culture, public, movie kind) is a manufactured fantasy and the ability to pilot a fantasy in someone else's head for the specific goal of transferring wealth allows only a slim margin or error.

I haven't studied films about video games. Perhaps I should -- the notion is fascinating. I remember 'Tron,' which so amazed us that a successful video game was created. The weaving of game and film here is rather crude: Lady Croft plays a game that has physical nemesis and environment, before going off on her real adventure. In fact, the distance between game and reality is exaggerated. Oh well, maybe Scott or the Coen brothers will take the game/film challenge.

Tron now seems ludicrous, because the effects are tired. We'll tire of these too, but the selling point here is the (we are incessantly told) sexcrazed Jolie. I prepared for this film by watching 'Cleopatra,' which I think is that pattern for these types of films: sex, the exotica of the past, effects.

Jolie is no Liz Taylor, and you can take that to the bank. But Liz was no Liz either. Watch it now and see how little margin for error there is for the manipulation of sex fantasy in your mind.

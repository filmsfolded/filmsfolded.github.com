If you were going to name a few things that were inherently cinematic, what would they be? Beautiful women, violence, smoke, water, dance, fireworks. and trains. Why trains? I suppose you might ask why any of these, but trains just seem such an odd thing for the cinematic eye to be drawn to. It isn't as if it is easy, in fact the technical challenges are significant, and we see the same shots over and over again: the drive wheels, the edge of the assembly whooshing by and away, the locomotive looking ahead and entering a tunnel...

And yet from the very first year, the camera and locomotive have been buddies.

You know, you could say that both compartmentalize in some technological niche, or both transport but its schoolishy ridiculous. We like em in movies and that's that.

So here we have a standard form: the town (nearly always a British town) that rallies to save some icon of identity against the march of mindless bureaucracy. And this time that icon is a train.

Three and a half trains in fact, and two of them quite pretty. The first is rather lovely and is wrecked. I saw this together with Ingrid Bergman in "Jekyll and Hyde" and the similarities are striking. Just striking.

The second is a dull beast made interesting by taking to the streets in a wild drunken joy ride.

The third is the movie's namesake, an ancient machine taken out of a museum and piloted by two old enthusiastic clergymen to satisfy a plot device designed only as an excuse to create the image. It is a small, stately matron like the old woman who appears precisely when it does.

The half a loco is an old fashioned steam powered steamroller that has a couple fights with the Bergman machine and wins.

If this were an "experimental" film, and the people were somehow neutron bombed out of it, it would be pretty interesting with these machines as abstract characters. But you do have the people in their odd, ordinary lives, leaving those lives at every opportunity to service these machines. So you'll have to erase them in your mind, your eye.

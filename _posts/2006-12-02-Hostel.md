Gosh. We are left today with only three horrors. The extravagant slasher movie, the wet Japanese ghost haunting, or the conspiratorial torture movie.

This last seems to have very few degrees of freedom. The setup of the conspiracy can be deep, folded and reflexive, like "Saw." The tortures can be increasing gruesome, horrible and explicit -- well, that essential. And the manner of the film-making can be excellent, meaning that the cinematic expression increases the rush and horror.

This last is what is advertised here. To judge from the box office success, it does actually push the state of the camera. I didn't see it. There was obvious attention to presenting one and a half torture scenes. A lot of expert attention went into this and I even image that they were shot early as a means to attract funding. The rest is merely adequate on all accounts.

The formula demands that the victims "ask for it" by at least making bad choices and ideally participating in one end of the machine for pleasure or profit, that machine turning around and biting. Here, it is sex. We are led to believe these guys are seeking deviant sex; it is mentioned enough and why they travel to this "dark" place. We never see any of course, because the formal for some reason allows exposed breasts to represent all matters of sex.

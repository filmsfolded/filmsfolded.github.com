Early in a filmmaker's career, he (usually he) has to choose one of two paths. One path is to work in the "Hollywood" system, which these days is the name of a highly distributed, collaborative machine. This path is more secure in the long run because people will watch almost anything if it is presented with an aura of competence. It is a stable machine that allows many disciplines a forum for the collaborative process.

You can only make big, complex films these days by belonging to this machine. But the overhead is immense. More than half your time -- time that would otherwise be creative time -- is spent in negotiating among trades and disciplines that after all these years still speak separate languages. The production staff provides interpretive services to support this.

Or, our filmmaker could choose another path, one that trusts his own instincts and refuses to compromise even when the machine claims rules are broken. Even when people get hurt. Even when branded radical.

Pollack, of course is in the first camp, and here -- late in his creative life -- he makes a film celebrating that choice. The metaphor is the UN, a rather heavy one, and the bad guy seems to have absolutely no redeeming quality. The story involves the making of a "movie," an artificial assassination and supporting narrative that the "filmmaker" intends to influence world opinion of him and his choices. Just like Pollack's motive.

Into this rough form, this intent and this larger metaphor Pollack pours a collection of story elements about voices. We have some business about whispers, about voices in notebooks, about speaking the names of the dead in a large story element, and (in segments that were cut) her alternative voice in the flute. Then there's lots of business about her job at the UN, which is an important life choice for her.

Notice that the term used is "interpreter" rather than the more limited and correct term "translator." Interpreting implies that the context surrounding the actual words is considered so that you may present something quite different than what was intended in order to produce the intended effect.

Pollack is smart enough to understand these folds. So are the three main actors who have all supported similar folds by their acting in recent projects.

But this ambitious project outstrips Pollack's ability to pull it off, so in an ironic way this becomes an argument against the collaborative, lowest common denominator type of art.

His creative priorities are: metaphor first, staging second, then coordinating the actors, the dialog and only then honking the story into some sort of flow. This means that his actors come in late in the process so they cannot be tractors to pull us through all the metaphors and layers. 

Kidman can really do well in certain roles. Here she contributes something solid to the enterprise in a synthetic accent that has an unnatural poetry. Her voice is noticeably whispy with an underlying power like the continent she intends to evoke. But Pollack and his machine cannot keep themselves from making her incredibly attractive and endearing. After all, that's what sells the tickets. (Now do you get the bodies in the stadium bit?)

What a shame, a misinterpretation.

Spoilers herein.

Genres are defined not so much for what they are but for the effect they have on us. We expect a summer action picture to thrill and have no regrets if we forget it immediately. Science fiction is all about embossing itself on our minds in a lasting way, sometimes through finding a familiar pattern and twisting it in unusual ways. I can still recall certain elements of 'Forbidden Planet' after almost 50 years, and of course 'Alien,' 'Blade Runner' and '2001.' Some of the 'Star Wars' visual noise sticks with many people. 

I even remember some elements from 'Mission to Mars' that I expect to keep forever, like that amazing shot where we zoom into a ship through the window and then -- in the same motion -- around the astronaut and engaging in what he is doing. This outKubrick's Kubrick. Also our tour of the spinning disk.

This film has many of the right pieces, but none of them are used to effect. There is no impression made at all. The only setup that comes close is the scene where exploding bugs stream out of a body, but it is not rooted in any imaginative context. Kilmer is not a bad choice: his Doc Holliday (and to a lesser extent Jim Morisson) were lasting impressions. And not too many actors can actually do that. But here, he is a man without tools. I wonder why any decisionmaker would invest in Ms Moss. She's as talentless as Sharon Stone.

Creating that coherent, alternative vision vision is the job of the director. I am convinced that there are at least a dozen directors who could take this same script and basic effects and make a killer film. Tony Scott, for instance. Just imagine it: it makes the time spent less of a waste.

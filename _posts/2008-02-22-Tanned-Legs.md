The further back you go, the earlier in the evolutionary chain of cinema. 

Even if the movie is uninteresting in a conventional sense, it has interest. Each of these early movies -- and there weren't that many -- was a firework shot into a sky, defining it.

This one is a rather crude imposition of a show onto several slightly related stories of romantic situations, and some sexual intrigue.

The show has the legs of the title rather overtly displayed in an obvious attempt to add spice to the stiff staging of the romantic episodes. Some of these involve the participants bursting into song, so its a strange amalgam of a musical on the story and one in the story. The stories are trite, as one would expect, but the women in the stories, even the vamps, are amazingly prim, especially when compared to the show girls.

These show girls, by the way, were selected for a different body type than usual for the period and more in line with modern trends: low body fat, muscle tone. As much is made of the Florida locale, that must have applied.

Spoilers herein.

'Woman in the Dunes' meets 'French Lieutenant's Woman' meets 'Strangers in Good Company.'

Films about film ideas are generally dreary affairs, engaging more on an intellectual level than the visceral world that is film's strength. Superficially, this film falls into that category with the 'dogma' bit as a seemingly political statement. In order to support it, we have what appears to be an ordinary kind of genre story (damaged people stranded in some way, with the resulting scrapes and dents). Judged on this grounds, this film is a failure: the dynamics among the characters just don't engage us by themselves.

But a dogma film is supposed to not be a genre film, so what gives? Perhaps genres are impossible to avoid. Perhaps this film intends something different: to be an exploration of acting and representation on screen. I take it as that. Although the filmmaker insists that the selection of 'King Lear' is an offhand one, I do not believe him. 'Lear' is all about the eye, and whether perceptions can be trusted, and what sort of hidden demons lurk on that road between the writer's and viewer's minds.

It is the basis of a similar 'dogma'-like experiment in music: John and Yoko's 'Revolution #9,' Playing precisely the same role there though not so explicit as here.

Hundreds of films in the past couple years deal in some way with the merger of actor and character, and the conflating of the experience you see and another you see created (the film within). I have a database on these -- you'd be surprised how common is the notion. But among these -- and going back in time somewhat -- one of the most interesting along the dogma lines is Godard's 'King Lear,' a truly amazing film. It is quoted here in a few places.

The key point is that the 'best' theater is close to the chaos of life, out of which the viewer can shape his own narrative based on their own demons. My narrative for this film is centered on the man who plays the King here, Brion James. He played Leon in 'Blade Runner,' the intellectual of the four targeted (bladed) replicants. That film is similarly about seemingly self-generated impressions. I had it from Dick in the seventies that his story (and a couple others) was inspired by 'Lear' and 'Tempest,' precisely because of this untrusted, constructed memory thing.

In 'Lear' of course, the King dies -- and with him we are meant to think -- dies the bending of reality that he carried about with him, screwing up all that came close. But in the film, the King stays alive, which I take to be the point: we never escape the perturbing lens of film. In 'real' life of course, Brion died right after filming this. In the film, he merely suffers delirium and is replaced by the actor/writer/director of the play. That makes sense.

Jennifer Jason Leigh takes on the Cordelia role, the one where Godard placed Molly Ringwald! Ms Leigh is among those actresses whose appeal is in her raw commitment. She doesn't work, she completely subordinates herself, just exactly like the sexual 'performance' we see here. It's an annoying habit of these young filmmakers to pack irony into every crevice, so she plays the one character in Lear that is incapable of just this commitment to artifice. That childish insistence on the part of Levring (and so many others) drags the whole affair down a couple notches from being worth watching. Oh well.

The surrogate for the filmmaker is played by David Bradley, who we have recently seen in a role deliberately taken from Lear: in the Harry Potter 2 spectacle as the groundskeeper and his magically petrified cat -- petrified because of the reflection it saw. Flibbertegibbit!

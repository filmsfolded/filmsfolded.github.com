It takes more than art direction. 

I didn't like "Pan's Labyrinth." For all its lovely images, it sketched a world of black and white with such extremes that every part of the world I know was burned into a barren no man's land. Visual invention only matters when it is linked to a cinematic vocabulary, and when competently done even that only matters if it builds a word that somehow imparts value, or gives us some material in building a life. I realized the irony in writing the comment for Pan that the extent of my damning was similar to what I was damning.

There's no such irony here. For better or worse, we know the mind of this filmmaker before we enter the theater. We know for instance that this will be a film that makes unrepentable villains from a religion based on human sacrifice, while the filmmaker holds a similar religion. That the happenstance of birth matters. That grief and pain can be, must be noble.

Take that twisted world, extend it to a very long chase scene, add some excellent art direction and mediocre cinemtaography, and you'll end up with this. 

I do believe that films are like people: some leave the world )some world) better, most merely amuse and have no matter, and some leave the world worse. Perhaps that last category must exist. Perhaps those poisoning films will have a new value later, like Riefenstahl's.

I truly believe this matters, negatively.

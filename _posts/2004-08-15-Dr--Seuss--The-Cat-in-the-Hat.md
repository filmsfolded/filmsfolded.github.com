Spoilers herein.

Of course you know that this movie is deemed a failure. Its a failure as a Seuss project, and as a movie. But it also fails as the sort of moronic moralizing parents think they are giving their kids by plunking them down in front of a TeeVee. And it has probably the most blasphemous use of a song from 'Sgt Pepper' in all history.

Of these, the most interesting to me is the Seuss dimension. The Seuss world - just like his stories - is one that pretends to be something but is actually something quite different. His moral is that morals are incidental, something that is more apparent through the drawings (an what they represent) than in the words and what they seem to mean.

Those drawings are more about the process of drawing than in efficiently representing things. That's why kids find them so appealing: they know they are drawings and all the odd things on the page are a result of playing with the pen rather than 'seeing' something. Seuss's world is a world where you do something - give a moralistic story or draw a fantastic drawing - but along the way, you have fun in a shared space between drawer and watcher. (That, incidentally, is the story in this case.)

The producers of this film completely misunderstood this central notion. They have sets and characters that superficially resemble the drawings. And they stage somewhat accordingly, for instance the two kids often stand side by side facing the camera but talking to each other. 

But this is all mechanical, no joy. No joy.

This is a forgettable movie today, though it seems it still is remembered fondly by some folks who saw it when new. In its day, it actually was pretty successful, despite being incompetent. It was because of the built in fan base.

Last night I saw a movie based on a toy, "Transformers." We have them based on children's books, TeeVee shows, games (video and board), radio shows, and even theme park rides (Pirates, Caribbean). Popular songs, superstitions and conspiracy theories. Hate and country. Country music for that matter.

All of these come with a built in fan base, and "Rollercoaster" had its. Its hard to imagine now, but roller coasters were before 90% of all junior high schoolers played with drugs. They were before we had "action" movies that gave adrenaline rush without the mess and effort. They were before airconditioning became common enough that people actually went out in the summer for something other than to be seen.

Rollercoasters were something. Dangerous, full of legend, spawning all sorts of Scooby-doo like mystery.

And they had fans. And those fans came.

Sometimes when you see a movie, it isn't the movie that matters. You might have a special actress or time or tone you want to recall and the movie is only the carrier, the trigger. This is such a one. Its a dreadful movie, just horrid. But it may be one of the only ones that could transport you to a world that no longer exists.

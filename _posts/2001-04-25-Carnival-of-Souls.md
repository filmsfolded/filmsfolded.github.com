Spoilers herein.

If you wish to see this, I recommend the Criterion DVD. It has a half-hour report on the 1989 rerelease, done by local TV about their nearby cult celebrities. It really helps to see these guys and understand where they are coming from before you see the film.

If you must see the film the ordinary way, watch the shorter version. But it is much better I think to completely turn the sound off and watch the images of the longer version. That's because the score (a vapid skating organ) and acting are amateurish. The story, as with most horror, is trivial.

But Herk really knew his camera, or at least some elements of it. The camera positioning is mostly fixed, sometimes handheld. There's no magic in the motion. There's no rhythm in the editing. But some of the framing and lighting is technically brilliant, especially at the end in the abandoned resort where something extraordinary happens to his images.

This is no ordinary goof. These are Kansans from the 50's. There is no irony here whatsoever. There's something frightening about the idea of Cornbelt Methodists bringing life to the profane through some technical brilliance. This scares not because of what it is, but where it came from.

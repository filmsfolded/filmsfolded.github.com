I like Ruiz, I really do, and I'm glad there seems to be a bottomless bag of his films and a challenge to find.

He's what I look for when I want that explicitly self-referential presentation style, plus some clever narrative tricks, but I don't want to have to wrestle angels to death. He's heavy in the way he works, and usually light in what he works toward. That allows me to see these as essays on storytelling instead of stories.

The story here, which you won't understand until the end, is a simple conspiracy. Its remarkably simple and straightforward.

But the way it is presented is remarkably puzzling, and ever so much more engaging than an ordinary narrative. It involves some crazy folks and "normal" folks that also seem logically impaired. There's the obvious, that this is seen as a demented mind would, all arrayed higgledy piggledy. And the result is also obvious, that only the demented are simple enough to be true, an irony since the presentation is extremely complex. It reminds me of Aaron Copeland's fantastic elaborations on "Tis a Gift to be Simple."

Before ten minutes are elapsed, we have a woman get up from a dinner table, walk over to the camera, look directly into it and then clean the lens. That lens goes astigmatic when one of our endearing nutcases loses it. Previously he sees a window as a mirror as we look at him through it. His mania includes giving proper names to inanimate objects: hers (there's a loopy woman) is poetry. 

As with many narrative experiments, there are detectives. But instead of being our representatives, they decide to "do nothing." Its a very clever and unsettling trick. We want to kick them because we fear we won't know what is going on until they do. The chief detective says that he can't figure things out because he is too much in the present while his partner is in the future. Meanwhile, as they waste time in the pub, someone is completing a crossword puzzle with the proper names of the characters we meet.

There are other cool narrative games, all lighthearted. Our crazy couple dances with his cheek not against hers, but against a painting she holds. A puzzling force in the story is "salsox" which we find at the end is a rather complex, almost supernatural condiment that might be the cause of this enriched world.

Suppose you want to have a light evening and you don't want to damage yourself with some gross comic. Here's your movie.

Spoilers herein.

I think it is okay to base a movie entirely on style, in fact I appreciate many such projects.

But when you do this, you'd better be darn good: original, clever, exciting. This measures  up in none of these three areas. It moves along, but it seems like a TeeVee show. You  know the sort of thing: all the style that was in last year's movies.

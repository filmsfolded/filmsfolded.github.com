Spoilers herein.

This is some pretty good writing. You know its pretty good when it deals with ordinary  silliness and is directed by a non-entity and yet still engages.

This is a fellow that is not afraid to write junk films, but who has also written the  amazingly deft self-referential 'High Fidelity' and the ambitious 'Denver when you are  Dead.' This must have been from that period when he wasn't successful and just wanted  to write.

You can see the method: start with one of the three startingpoints: Nabokov. In  movieland, that means make every character a competing storyteller and have a distinct  reference to 'Lolita.'

Add to that 'Wizard of Oz,' which in movieland means three goofy guys swirling around  the girl and wondering what life is all about.

(Since Rosenberg likes us to know what he is doing, there are copious references to  these two sources.) 

Then simply expand the Dorothy to several bodies, sharpen the dialog - especially the  Lolita lines - and you end up with this.

This movie is bad for two reasons. Both are deadly in my opinion.

The first is the way it was envisioned, as a video recording of a stage production. There's a world of difference between what works on the stage and the screen. They made no adjustments whatever in the character's mannerisms, and the staging.

The result is a dreadfully ineffective movie. The only time it works is when we see the show within the show, the "Springtime for Hitler." Alas, less time is given to this than in the original movie. Really, almost nothing works. One or two of Lane's facial reactions and his number in jail. All else is a horrible mistake in terms of the production decisions.

The other deadly element is the gay humor. The 68 original was based on this too, but in those days queers were considered fair game, as were blacks. Since this one broadens all the jokes, the gay jokes are more extreme. Yes, I know that the "gay community" thinks it is all in good fun, and the show is amazingly successful.

But it still strikes me as ironic that in defusing the holocaust (against Jews, Gypsies and gays) with humor, that humor is based on what are essentially antigay attitudes. Look, I even liked "Freddy got Fingered," so the humor of debasement is okay with me. But not when it claims to be something else.

Mel, you need to be ashamed.

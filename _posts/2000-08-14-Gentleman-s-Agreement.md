Of the last hundred films I have seen, this is the least artful. It is heavy, blunt, preachy and totally lacking in any depth. Production values and acting are poor.

While the goal is lofty, one must see this primarily as a  historical artifact, as sanctimonious propaganda tooting America's moral superiority at the beginning of the Cold War. At root, it ironically celebrates the difference between us tolerant Americans and those "other guys."

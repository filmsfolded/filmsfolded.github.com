Spoilers herein.

Warren Beatty was a budding genius when this was made -- sort of an Orson Welles. Determined to bring then novel French sensibilites to Hollywood, he created a specific vision. Most films are about other films, and all the references here are French.

This film transformed Hollywood, and launched a dozen or so major careers. It is a milestone and should be seen on that basis alone. But its value in its time was that it was so different. I remember seeing it when it was new, in the brief period before it was withdrawn in failure. (It later came back.) That first screening was a shock: the shot in the face at the bank, the two shots in the face of the brother and wife, the dancing bodies at the end were different, but the real shock was the expanding of our collective eye. You had to be there -- its not the same now.

The reason it doesn't have that same effect today is because it was so successful in setting a new tone. But two scenes still have power: the first scene with a nearly nude desperate Faye whose eye just happens on enough to make a situation out of. This has an idealist film concept behind it, a presentation that is still modern and abstract.

The second scene is the meeting of Bonnie's family at a picnic with CW standing guard. The film is washed yellow and overexposed. The action is close to what an amateur might film at a real picnic. But its realness makes it stand out at the most artificial scene in the film, the center that in other films would be set by a narrator or chorus. 

Beatty would go on to make two other groundbreaking film, 'Reds,' and 'Shampoo,' and then he lost his vision. Dick Tracy was ambitious and beyond his means, and we lost a great talent. What we have now is 'Bulworth,' how sad.

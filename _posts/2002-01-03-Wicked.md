Spoilers herein.

Yes, I rented this because of an interest in Ms Julia. But it did not repel me. 

I suppose that is because I value different things in a film than most. The story normally interests me less than the narrative. Neither is of interest here.

Sometimes, the self-awareness of the actor interests me. That's what I was looking for, as Stile's Ophelia impressed me. But no payoff in this film.

What I found mildly charming was the competent pop handling of old film grammar. This is to De Palma as Brittany is to Chuck Berry. The start with the finish, the faceted wedding ring, the whiteout cuts, the POVs, the crawlspace shots, the reflection in the eye, the splatter, the closeup of Julia's eye when first made up...

A real lesson in how original visions can be incorporated in a common film grammar, and be used more or less without notice.

People love this film. It is gentle, somewhat relaxing. Sweet, at least superficially. 

No character in this entire story isn't at root a good person at heart, even the one Burt Lancaster plays. It seems to end happily, with money all around, the Lancaster character redeemed and a ne research lab established.

But look closer.

The backstory is that Happer (Lancaster) had a dad that cheated a Scot named Knox out of an oil company worth hundreds of millions. Now the son, Happer wants to buy a village and Knox's son is the holdout. Happer hates himself, naturally and is obsessed with skygazing.

The main character is an underling of the oil company sent to buy up the town. He falls in love with it, but at the end is exiled. We end with his bittersweet return to a disgusting Houston. We know that the townspeople hate their town, hate their lives, hate that the Air Force uses the surrounding area for bombing practice.

At the end we know they will not be able to move as they had hoped. The Russian smuggler will be the only one whose live will not get worse.

It is a sweet film that leaves you bleak afterwards, rather like the "Wicker Man" of a decade earlier.

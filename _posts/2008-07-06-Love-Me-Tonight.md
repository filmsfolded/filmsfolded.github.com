At first glance, this will be a waste of time for you, if you are like me. Its an early musical, about a particularly vapid sort of love, and featuring the most repellent of French values. It has actors that generally are weak, and songs that never mattered.

But its wonderful, because it is wonderfully constructed. It is in fact one of the first films to enhance the vocabulary of the camera by allowing it to move in a way that through edits is orchestrated. It doesn't yet have curiosity or intent. Its purely without emotion or meaning, something that would be impossible today. Today, no camera movement or perspective can be used without carrying an association. Here, it is allowed to just be decorative.

The movie's story is about a man whose entire focus is dressing, who fails in love with a woman at first glance because of her appearance. You will fall in love with this because of its appearance, in fact precisely because it has no inner soul. Its pure cinema in ways that Brakhage never could know.

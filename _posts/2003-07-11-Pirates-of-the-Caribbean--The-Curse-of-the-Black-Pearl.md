Spoilers herein.

Disney films usually have a moral. Here they stretch themselves in several ways beyond  the obvious first-time PG-13 rating. The implicit moral here is that it is okay to steal so  long as the establishment is unreasonable. And further that there is a higher justice.

What's interesting is how the Disney machine works. They'll exploit any cinematic notion  they can to give a thrill if that thrill is somehow tied to increased admissions. Disney has  the industry's most advanced lab on these matters: they track artistic notions and  cognitive science in quest of maturing artistic notions as fodder for their products. This  is no collection of artistic types, but serious scientists, intent on engineering your  response.

Put those two together and here you have an interesting theft: the wholesale adoption of  the architectural camera. We saw it in "Nemo" where the whole thing played with the  three-dimensionality of the space. We saw it in the second Harry Potter movie, where  they paid lots of attention to the placement of the situation in relationship to the actual  building of the school. In Hollywood filmdom, this technique -- always locating the  camera in relationship to a wall -- was developed by Terry Gilliam. That explains why  Depp works so well with the effect. He knows where your eyes are supposed to come  from.

Rush has worked on four films that reference the placement of self in space. These two  together: the good and bad pirates, are both intelligent actors that can listen to the lab.  This is an engineered product, openly stolen from others (like the equally well- engineered "Charlies Angels 2").

It's not as clever as "Nemo," not something you will actually remember like "12 Monkeys,"  not something that challenges you like "Panic Room" started out to be, not as self-aware  as "Hulk"s swoops. But it uses the same notions, and uses them well enough to give a  good ride. Now that this has entered the mainstream, what's next for real creative types?

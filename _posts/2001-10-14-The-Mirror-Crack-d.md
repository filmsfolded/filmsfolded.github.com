Many of the most interesting films are films about films. Here we have a book about films that was made into a film of a book, and the result is fascinating. Genres evolve, and the changes reflect and probably cause change in the culture.

It doesn't interest because it is well done, because it is not. The performances are laughable, in that way that Americans poke fun at superficial Brits through even more laughably exaggerated, superficial acting.

No, this film interests because it is a major event in the development of the film mystery, a scientific fossil which has value not in what it is, but what it tells us about what followed. Though the book leverages two forms of drama: films and the village fete, the British village drama is missing here. Its loss is particularly missed because that's the fulcrum that Ms. Marple used. The whole point was insight abstracted from common sense of everyday life.n The 'mirror' was the rather intelligent mirror of life mirrored in the presentation of life.

What we have here is a Hollywood abstraction instead: a very slightly eccentric, rather lovable old sleuth who simply cranks through the clues on the audience's behalf. Lansbury establishes not only her own, entire career playing essentially this role, but we see here the first of a mature genre. Mature enough to parody by the performances: Liz Taylor as a fat, past her prime old actress: Novak as a bimbo; Hudson as preener.

The only respectable performance is by Ms. Chapman, who seems to have been an under-appreciated talent. By the way, did anyone else notice Lee Marvin as the conductor in the flashback?

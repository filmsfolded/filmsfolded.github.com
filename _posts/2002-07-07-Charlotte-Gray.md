Spoilers herein.

There is no actress like Cate. She completely dissolves herself in the activity around her. She is the spice, not the meat, and therefore becomes the driving force in the meal.

Anderson is a rare visionary as well. She is interested in subtle misdirection. She tells a story just like others, but the story is not the matter of the experience. The meat of the story is secondary to the real but hidden focus. To even name it reduces it from that complex, fragile emotional fabric that Anderson targets. Together, these two women try something ambitious. With 'Oscar and Lucinda' it succeeded wonderfully because the story was so unfamiliar. It didn't allow us to fall back on cinematic patterns. We therefore were allowed to focus on the femaleness of obsession versus compulsion. Lovely. Worth watching.

This project is no less artful or ambitious. But it fails because the story type is too familiar. People can watch it and think it is a movie about a spy in wartime France. That's too bad, because it probably will hurt the careers of these two women. Cate only a bit I assume.

This is film about what it means to be a woman: to always be in unfamiliar territory; to always have to reconcile who you 'really' are with who you willingly pretend to be; to have to deal with tragedy rather than prevent it; to be of service to others while maintaining a center of self. But all that is placed behind the story, where it is supposed to be; but until we have a more cinematically literate audience, films like this will be shunted aside. Just like the women they portray.

Spoilers herein.

This is lovely. It is lovely if you are into acting: the men involved superbly set a foundation for the two women Cate and Julianne who are among our greatest living actors. These women duel but not in the uninteresting way by butting heads. (For egregious examples of this see how Denzel works.) Instead, what they do is create ever high levels of annotation on the situation, each at a higher level of abstraction than before, all the while keeping the plate spinning form the prior effort. This is not a profound vehicle by any means, but it is profound acting.

This project is also lovely if you love language. Wilde knew how to form the most succinct quips, much better than Shaw, his only competition. Most of this is framed as dialog that flies back and forth almost too fast. Wilde is where Capra found his notion of screwball, so in a sense almost everything we see on screen is influenced by Wilde's few plays.

This project is also lovely if you are into self-reference as the basis of art, that kind of art that defines how we advance our ability to abstract, especially how to abstract cool soft stuff like love. Here, we have Wilde writing about the dangers of the written word; how one committed, words constrain every element of everything that follows. The best we can do in life (he seems to say) is to just begin writing it and adapt to the consequences. (We have a key scene with our friends attending a play, another Wilde one. We have another key scene with Northam 'performing.')

A fine man. An ideal author.

Unbalanced

This is a well loved version of the classic. Its really quite an education playing with the ideas that must have been behind certain decisions in the different versions. 

Some of the ordinary values are present here: the emphasis on faces and places. The places are indeed more present than I recall in any other adaptation of any book. They really do matter here, with the interesting effect that it seems to have been done expertly without obviousness.

Also there has been a decision to focus on traditional character acting instead of rumbling through the story. That fits well with the usual face shots, required for TeeVee. But it contrasts with other productions where the focus was more clearly the story.

The benefits are straightforward. The two characters here are more fleshed out, more grounded than elsewhere. Jane in particular is real. We understand her. Rochester is a tougher case, because we're not supposed to understand him, simply accept that forces are at work within him that are beyond our reach. (They were beyond Charlotte.) As we align with Jane, we feel actually rooted. Yearning is a shared connection that transcends all others I believe., and we do share it with this actress, Ruth Wilson.

There are a few sequences in this strategy that fail for me. One is that business on the moor. The filmmaker chooses to use the same facial presentation during this period, and the point is that the character is losing self. She's without her love, and literally loses her being. Its a dramatic challenge because the tools we have by then all depend on our connection with that being. But you cannot have it two ways. This is a literally rocky bit.

But there are structural difficulties with this set of overall choices. Its because the story has heft. Its possibly the most densely structured book written in English. Everything that drives the story has been introduced within the story previously. We see that Jane is attracted to a man before she even meets him because he adopts a little girl he didn't have to. Want to know why? You need the bits about her being rejected. 

Want to appreciate this business of soulmates? You need the discussion about twins and the notion of coupling. There are deep, deep symmetries in all this, the earlier the more important.

So you cut matter out of the beginning with peril, but that's what they've done. They did it for obvious reasons, so they could have a clean break between the two episodes. But it breaks things elsewhere.

Gone is Miss Templeton and her "betrayal" by getting married. Gone is the almost lesbian bonding with Mary Burns, and the importance of hair. Gone is the justice of and to the schoolmaster. Gone are the difficulties associated with teaching.

So what it trades in likability and access, it abandons in depth, which is why we go to Bronte in the first place, right?

The ending, with Grace Poole holding Jane's child? Wrong. Some rejections are absolute.

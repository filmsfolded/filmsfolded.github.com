Spoilers herein.

This was clearly Sharon Stone's movie, so much so that the team didn't do enough to keep Berry from embarrassment. She's no real actress, but she didn't deserve having nearly everything being done only halfway. Compare how the camera treated Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy with this to see what I mean.

And compare to how much more effectively Stone is dressed and framed. This and Demi Moore's role in 'Charlie's Angels 2' answer the question about what happens to faded starlets. They get a second, much more effective career as bad matrons - more effective because the characters are so unique and the glamor of the camera so much more effective.

This could have gone so many different ways to success, but it just sort of stayed in the middle subject to much the same curse as the cosmetics in the story.

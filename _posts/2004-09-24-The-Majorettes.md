Spoilers herein.

Yeah all the usual production values are horrible. And the setup is along the lines of Jess Franco, but with adolescent body types. 

All is pretty dreary until two thirds of the way through when the slasher is discovered and blackmailed. The thing quickly disintegrates into a battle among evil groups. It is an incompetent film, but a pretty interesting collection of events in that latter third, of a scope worthy of Tarantino.

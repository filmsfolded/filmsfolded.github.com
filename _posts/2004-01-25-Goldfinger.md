Spoilers herein.

This is the best of the Bonds, in part because the action/gizmo genre was so young. In  those days - hard to believe - this was smart humor, was sexy and thrilled. Now it is  merely of historical interest only.

Worse, there are franchises that one can watch and really get a lesson in the diversity of  filmmaking. The Alien series does that for me. Even Freddy. But these - after this one -  innovated in no way at all.

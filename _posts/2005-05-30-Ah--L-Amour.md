The very best thing about Hertzfeldt is his original vision of animated stick figures.

This is the very first and has many of the elements that make some of his subsequent work worthy. What's missing is the overt self-reference. The character is clearly himself, but in other works, the drawer is explicit, and often the paper as well.

But still funny, if you are a guy. The very same theme occurs in his "rejected" collection where the entire business world rejects the work. But that latter effort is much more clever in that it exploits his OTHER big idea (past the stick figures) the self- reference in the world, not the character.

You already know that this is a mess, and I won't belabor the "design-by-committee" approach that goes with weak filmmakers. When you pay $30m just to have a grumpy goof show up, you've got to lower risks on all fronts. 

And. And also to note that Harrison Ford must really be delusional to still believe after all his failures that he is a good enough actor to do comedy.

But in the midst of all the little jobs done by various trades (the cars, the girls, a few jokes) there were two elements that were not a waste: two of the most interesting mature women in film. Lena's turn as radio call in host is an obvious nod to her "Lightness of Being."

We just saw that house last week in "the Italian Job."

Made Poorly

Spoilers herein.

'Swingers' was ambitiously clever. Flawed but showed some awareness of itself.

Now along comes what is advertised as chapter 2. But this time one of the duo directs. Big mistake. Actors just have a different set of sensibilities and concerns than filmmakers. Filmmakers need to worry about the delivery of a narrative that inserts itself into your soul/ They're composers. Actors are single instruments.

So what we have here is just a loosely connected collection of skits, engineered to allow Vaughn to embarrass. We are given the Falk character as surrogate to tut-tut about the dope. That's pretty thin justification for capturing us.

Nothing clever or rewarding here, folks. That's even stranger when you consider they sought out Christopher Doyle, the man who put new life into cinematography with Kar-wai Wong. His eye is subdued here; I guess he just couldn't find an educated mind to attach his educated eye to.

Famke is redhead here, sorta. I'm beginning to appreciate how redheads are used in film, usually without thinking. Here, she is a sexy loser, even to the point of giving away her child.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

This is something of a landmark film, at least in the horror genre, that genre that flourished before the slasher notion took hold. 

It had competent management cinematically. The effects were not hokey. Though it was in 3d, the use of dimension was understated. 

Ironically, it features an artist who is crippled and who needs assistants to do his work. The director of this film was visually handicapped and could not see the space, and relied on assistants. 

Since this is a tedg comment, we may as well get the folding issues out of the way:

Right after the intermission, the new wax museum is opened and a barker attracts customers. As he chats up the passers-by, he turns to the movie audience and talks to them. In the original 3d, this folding effect is emphasized by his paddling one of those balls on an elastic that he punches at on-screen characters before punching at the audience. Clever.

The notion of wax figures representing life figures and the conflating of the two is an idea similar to one used extensively elsewhere, mostly in cons and stories acting. Its surrounded here by the character Price plays, which mirrors the situation. We see him before the tragedy in a "normal" state. After the tragedy (during which we see many statue faces melt), he has a melted face. He covers it sometimes with a wax mask that reproduces his undamaged face. These some disguise of his mobility as well.

The curious thing is that this different than the wax-face dynamic that forms the horror. In this version of the story, the victims are usually dead and are selected because their face is special. Some statues are of the actual persons inside them and are worth seeing because the murder of that very person is newsworthy. Some other statues are related to the person within because the face is appropriate for the character depicted.

It may sound trivial, me nitpicking these things, but I think they matter. There's a process that happens when you enter a film. You literally enter a world. The more clear the world is and the more effectively you are introduced to it, the deeper you can immerse yourself in the effect, in this case horror. Its an art, that process of introduction and part of the art is giving us a situation we can enter, usually subconsciously.

Other Price movies do this superbly. "Theater of Blood" is perhaps the best. It also happens to be deeply folded, where the drama and presentation of the movie is folded into the plays within. Here we have all the components, and we go halfway, but it just doesn't work.

Just watch it, and you'll see what I mean. Its a failure. Other versions have the basic mechanics better.

What's interesting about these projects is the collage.

The story is simple: two young lovers. She refuses to marry him because he is poor. They break up and each become coupled with someone wealthy. They discover love is what matters so they reconcile.

Its boring and predictable. The thrill is supposed to be in watching their debauched fun while rich. The cinematic device is the collage. We see a series of images, first of her and later of him. Images of partying, laughing, drinking. We are meant to infer wild sex, gluttony, but the collage is tame.

That's because the technique within the collage is the swirl. Compared to the rest of the movie, indeed all movies of the era this collage was supposed have much shorter segments, more focused and abstract, whooshing by with lots of swirls in between.

I'll bet it worked in its day. I'm sure it did. But today this brisk skating of images is the norm.

Its a disturbing realization. Its not just the notation that's changed, is it?

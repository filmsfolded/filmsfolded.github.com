Spoilers herein.

In the 60's, Japanese audiences criticized Kurosawa for not being Japanese. This film is exemplar of what they had in mind: extremely styled after Japanese watercolors; very slow reactions in the actors; studied movements; highly elaborate, theatrical setups for the final horror. Many recommend it for the stylistic elements alone, and I can too.

But more interesting to my mind is how the Japanese deal with self-reference. These stories follow a literary tradition of self-aware fiction where the act of storytelling becomes subtly entangled in the story. And so too here:

--The first story is about the penalty of not coordinating one's narrative with reality.

--The second is about the penalty of telling that narrative inappropriately. The telling of the story often destroys elements in the story which overlap with the life of the storyteller.

--The third, the most elaborate and intended to be the centerpiece, is about all stories being dead. Stories keep the past alive, but since the story and reality are so confabulated, the past keeps stories alive. This sequence is the most elaborate in staging, but also the most elaborate metaphorically: the poet is protected by writing on his body. Terrifically powerful image, one elaborated by Greenaway in his Japanese-centric 'Pillow Book.' But alas, writing and speech are different, so the poet has his ears stolen by the past.

--The final story looks at things the other way: the three previous were focused on the storyteller. Now here is the listener and about the penalties of swallowing the story. Even the smallest drink captures you. Your reality cannot be separated from that of the story (image).

Each of these self-referential Japanese story-morals is combined with two other arts, the art of watercolor as already mentioned and that of film. Quite rich.

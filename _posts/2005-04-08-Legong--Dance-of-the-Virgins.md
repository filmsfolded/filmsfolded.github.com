This is a wonderful little film, and I'd like to recommend it to you, but I have trepidation. The story itself is rather banal, but who cares? Cinema isn't about story anyway. The color in this, with extreme browns in the print I saw, are extraordinary and might be enough alone to recommend this by itself.

The whole thing is shot in Bali before the various race riots brought on by immigration and tourism. The story is constructed is such a way that several religious ceremonies can be depicted: marriage, funerals and so on. These are hypnotizing, especially the motions of the priest's hands. I could have watched that alone for an hour. (If anyone knows more footage like this, I'd sure like to know.)

And all the women are lovely, as we know ahead of time. Ah, Gauguin and Brando!

My trepidation is colonial voyeur's guilt. This is a valuable film because it transports me to an unfamiliar world, a whole world not just a poorly or partially crafted one. But it is a world that belongs to someone. Though 70 years separates my eye from the action on the film, my watching is one of the several actions that destroyed the place.

My original angst over this sort of thing was from "The Gods Must Be Crazy" a similarly engrossing voyage into another world. Only it had a good story, or at least one that didn't strike one as a mere excuse. I saw it when it first came out and was immensely entertained. The bushman who "starred" in it killed himself thereafter, the confrontation with our world overwhelming his ability to live.

Making movies is serious business, I think. Watching them is similarly serious. Both need to be done carefully because done well, both are dangerous.

The heroine in this project kills herself on screen. I wonder what her delicate life was like after the film ends. 

Pieces of this movie found their way into "Love Island."

Spoilers herein.

The production values on this are horrid, if that matters to you.

A disaster. Sayers' character was a reflection on the then British re-examination of the class system. What makes Lord Peter's stories unique is not that they were clever mysteries, because many others were as clever -- or more. It's Lord Peter, his man Bunter, and later additional characters and family members. 

Lord Peter was war-damaged, undeservedly coddled, randomly privileged. He was obnoxious, self-centered, careless, a preening fop. Occasionally, he could charm, mostly with women. He was not intelligent, and that's the charm: he was a sort of anti-Holmes, and any pure deduction was likely to come from Bunter.

In short, the whole point is to poke rather sharp fun of everything British in a more direct and personal way than Christie would.

But look what the BBC has done to this character! He is charming, smart, not aloof. While all the essential parts of the mystery can be found here, the guts have been ripped out of it. The famed Damlier is even transmuted into a Bentley! Presumably, during the Cold War, the staid BBC is afraid of what this had to say about society. Too socialist.

If you choose to see this, look for Betty, fresh from Monty Python's Holy Grail. Sweet.

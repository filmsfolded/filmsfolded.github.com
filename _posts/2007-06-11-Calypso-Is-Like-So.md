Wow, pretty fantastic. Right up my alley. If you like a heavy dose of movie in your movie, you'll like this.

The story is simple, and it derives from the basic fact that many films are a matter of war between actor and filmmaker. They just have different missions, different lives altogether. In the worst, most comic case, an actor fully embodies the role. That's what we have here, an actor gone berserk by taking his roles seriously. He's a Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum type.

We encounter him on the set of (apparently) "Calypso like So," which we know because of the huge sign with those letters. He's living in a trailer on this (again, apparently) abandoned set. This is all about him, though another character will pass through, a woman.

We'll learn that he is mad, that like "The Last Picture Show," and the less comic and more engaging "Millennium Actress," his roles have become life. But because he is mad, he has killed everyone. A "blond journalist" comes on the set, is drugged, forced into a role, photographed, and killed, all according to film roles that have become stereotypes.

Its clever, dense and short.

Spoilers herein.

It isn't often that I watch and old movie and it works on me at it was originally intended. This situation, though obnoxiously artificial, and a little too breathless, still left me suspended in an afterglow. That there was an unhappy happy ending was something sweet, and in the final measures much less condescending than almost anything of similar flavor.

But this had me from the very first scene. Three people are singing in a bar in Hong Kong for tossed coins. One of the coins falls in a spittoon. The guy on the left, nearest the spittoon, quickly judges it a loss. But the guy next to him cannot forget about it. It is one of the fastest dives into the core of a film I can recall. Ever.

That small moment of the 'short form' sets up the larger story: here we have two people, one coin and one spittoon. And the coin isn't wasted.

There's the standard folding bit: the play has a play within in the form of a con.

William Powell surely was working hard during this period, what with the Thin Man and Philo Vance and so many other projects, most of which tapped the same studied charm. This is a pre-Hays gem, with especially sexy clothes, sexy only in a theatrical way.

One can only wonder where films would have gone if the Hays Office hadn't existed. Toward more natural allure, I suspect and less of what we have today, the titillating.

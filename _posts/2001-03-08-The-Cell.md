Spoilers herein.

Weak script. Bad acting (except for D'Onofrio, who has done memorable work). Even big Latin butts don't do it for me. (Watch Musetta Vander as Mrs Baines who outclasses Lopez. )

Science fiction with absolutely no science. Every plot device is stolen.

What is interesting is the art -- I suppose it is a matter of taste how effective it is. I really like this sort of thing when done well. Done poorly is 'What Dreams May Come.' Done well is 'Prospero's Books.'

In between are all manner of mixes of brilliant imagination and pretense. I'm willing to tolerate a lot of pretense, because I think the world needs lots of risktaking so far as cinematic vision. 'Titus' failed to hit a home run with me, but I celebrate the attempt. Not so sure here.

The problem I have is a matter of coherent vision. Some scenes impress. Some effects work. But it is all a jumble as if many people generated many different notions, using whatever was available. If an attempt had some power, it was kept regardless of whether it fit an overall concept. So what we have is a dozen different 3 minute episodes that use roughly the same characters. Some are effective, most not. Few are original.

Ridley Scott and Peter Greenaway have the ability to build a vision that is sustained through a film, that because it sustains, can be elaborated and enfold depth. Their visions can serve as a structure into which other components fit. With less novelty, all good directors do. DePalma comes to mind. Others.

The difference between what can be done and what is here is vast.

Why do filmmakers subconsciously relate suspense of a film to suspending people in that film?

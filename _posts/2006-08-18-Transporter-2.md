I liked this a lot. But that's largely because I spent a lot of time with the BMW shorts that had a world class director make a short based on the idea. They're very clever.

The deal is simple: an ultracool guy, some matters of honor, cars, fights.

Its merely a matter of whether the guy is cool enough (he is), the fights are engaging (they aren't) and the chases sweep you up. Well, the last one is a simple checklist.

Hero jumps from plane or copter to train or truck? Check.

Hero fights while driving and has at least one of the following: hanging on the side and having the bad guy driver try and scrape you off; being dragged under the thing; falling out the door and jumping back in a surprise later. Check, check, check.

The chase at the beginning is a bit less obvious.

The girl is refreshingly not a babe. Its the only European influence.

See this only as preface for the BMW films.

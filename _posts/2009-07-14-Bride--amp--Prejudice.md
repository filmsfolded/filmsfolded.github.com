One of the things I am following these days is the resilience of story elements. 

It is puzzling to me, in part because of the mystery of what people think a movie is. Invariably, viewers will describe a movie as being "about" what happens in the story. If a movie is made of a book and the story deviates in any way, it is noticed, even if more essential effects are preserved or even enhanced. But those plot elements survive and move from project to project in an apparently desperate attempt at survival, like Bach preferring life as Muzak rather than being ignored.

Jane Austen is important to me, because she was one of the originators of the long form called a novel. This form is one of the primary constraints and powers behind successful films. Her version depends on internal, personal struggles with a crisply defined external environment that buffets her choices. She was English, but is one of the forces behind what in America would appear as noir.

The whole enterprise depends on two dynamics: the public recognition and affirmation of the "rules" of society, and the deeply internal, silent, personal negotiation between the power of self and creative accommodation. 

Now here we have the story of "Pride and Prejudice" conveyed pretty much whole, but with absolutely none of this dynamic. The reason is that the Bollywood musical, indeed the modern stage musical depends on openness. In order for there to be a song and dance routine that involves dozens, internal struggles get revealed to the "public" so that they can express or comment on them. The form demands an opening of the mind, a recognition in the crowd that something is going on.

So instead of the richness of person that art depends on, we get a simplicity that religion is founded on. Instead of impossibly soft human fabrics of urge, we get broad crisp stokes that can be expressed in a few lyrics. 

It is astonishing, because it seems that we are seeing a similar thing in the negotiation of the story. Just like Jane's characters have to accommodate the small menu presented in order to live, to be, to express self, so do narratives. Narratives have agency, personhood, desires, urges in themselves. They have to make choices and sometimes -- well, usually -- we do not have a happy ending. This is the choice that this story made: to survive as a vulgar Hindu- flavored chant.

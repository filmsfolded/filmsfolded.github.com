I simply do not like Hopkins. I think he is simply dull and lazy, conditions that talent and experience cannot overcome.

We've seen him in projects where his personal inadequacies support the role ("Remains of the day"). And we've seen him deliberately pushed to the point of embarrassment and declaring that he would quit acting. Recently, it has been one tiresome disaster after another. Shucks, if Michael Caine can find himself again, why can't this guy?

Well, here is his shot at doing something that matters, and I have to give him credit for knowing that he is in trouble. This is an incredibly risky endeavor. It deserves a close look. He has decided to place it somewhere among "Naked Lunch," "8 1/2" and "Singing Detective." He has -- apparently without much control -- turned over the editing job to a guy that is a B-lister but who has worked with the Cohens.

I am convinced that a better editor could have made up for the fact that Hopkins simply does not understand those three films I note. The composition here is juvenile. I saw this with "The Tracey Fragments," which has less but competent narrative structure and more masterful cinema. I assume that Hopkins thought that frenzy would cover the emptiness.

I wish he would have looked at Jodorowsky or even Hopper's inverted experiment instead. Then his confusion would be an asset, and we would be better off. Failure is honorable; cheating is not.

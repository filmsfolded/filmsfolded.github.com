Spoilers herein.

You have to remember the context. This was before Bill Gates rolled over the world and held us up for 100 billion dollars by being a thug nerd. It was during a time when society from President Reagan to high school administrators was championing American virtue rather than intelligence. It was a time when sexual equality and respect for intellectual matters took a few giant steps back. It was before Columbine. It was a time when the jocks ruled.

In all times, ordinary comedy pokes fun at the prevailing values and, after the fun, ends with a simple moral. And so it is here. What makes this movie so remarkable are the two morals, one serious, one half-joking.

The first is that nerds are better at sex. Despite its titillating wrapper, it presents a profound insight into American society, even today -- though the stereotype of 'nerd' has drifted quite a bit. The second is that most people in society are not in the privileged, celebrated  class, at least not in ways that they value.

High school comedies fascinate me. That's because high schoolers are faced with a very small selection of personality types among which they must choose. Those who fight the choice actually constitute one of these types. I believe the number to be constant at seven, but that's my own theory. By setting a comedy or drama in high school, something all of us have been through, you get huge shortcuts in setting up the world of your story. The seven types are immediately recognized and you can get on to your parody or whatever you intend. This film is notable in addressing the nature of the world itself.

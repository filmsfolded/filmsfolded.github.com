Set together, these ten experiments and the two extensions, are must viewing. There's a scope and variety, a rhythm that is almost transcendental. If you like Tarkovsky and Wong, you have to see this transitional event.

But taken individually, they are pretty uneven. This is not a good one. Sure, it has lots of the values non-cinematic viewers associate with Kieslowski, but which really come from his partner: story knots and drama.

But (as these were shot in order), the man was simply worn out by now. In particular, it has stamps (series of stamps), locks, bodily sacrifice, non-human beings, brotherly containment. All these in another Kieslowski project would be elaborated visually.

But not here.

Spoilers herein.

I collect films about films, and have discovered a huge class that this film represents. Fashion photographer or pornographer. Video tapes of sex. A murderer. A detective also engaged in sex somehow, often with someone involved in the case. Extremely low production values. Lots of simulated, flavorless sex of course.

These aren't mysteries in the traditional sense where we are introduced to suspects and then suss things out. Instead, we have the TeeVee version where characters pop up as we go. Never mind, you should be able to spot the murderer quickly, especially if you know that absolutely nothing (minus the sex) is there unless it is necessary. So when a scar is noted, it is important.

Spoilers herein.

This project is the first mainstream film to be built around the increasingly popular idea of simultaneous different characters. The root of the idea comes from the Brando school, where an actor both presents the character and his 'commitment' to the the character. Over time, and with the saturation of irony in the culture, this has been embellished. The French Lieutenant's woman was the first (at least to me) mainstream film where two roles were fully conflated. Kubrick had pulled the opposite trick with Sellars in Strangelove and Lolita.

We have been seeing this notion grow and grow mostly in actor discussion but few performances except those from Penn, Depp, Moore and Blanchett. But it has completely captivated Hollywood. Recently we saw one mainstream solution in Nurse Betty -- relatively simple for the actress to pull off because she was supposed to be unknowingly inhabiting several persona. Ball is another, relatively simple solution.

I myself consider it a real evolution in society when advanced notions like this enter the popular mainstream. And there is no mistaking that this film has nothing original, but is an engineered product using ideas tested in the arthouse. No fatal knock, that.

The setup here is that the multidimensional bit only happens in the last few seconds. Everything else is preparation for that moment. We know it is coming, underlined by the signals. Among those signals are the artifice of the characters (the evil Dad, the noble, talented prisoner, the poor fat kid), the synthetic situation (three interlocked deaths in three days) and the coincidence (the chance of her waitressing at his diner, the happenstance of his arriving at the accident scene). 

We are used to such simplification when presented as expository setup. And we are now used to spending a whole film being set up (Blair Witch, Sixth Sense) for that final moment. Hollywood loves it because it sends us out of the theater wondering and talking, and that buzz drives boxoffice.

So. The deal is that Ms Berry is supposed to be spending her 110 minutes establishing character dimensions, mileposts, souvenirs throughout the film that she can have us recall in those final moments. 'Multidimensional' here means more than real, it means ultrareal, something that is so unusually rich it enriches. The camera helps by adopting the odd ultra real perspectives that have also been wrung out in art houses by clever people. We saw similar mainstream use of these ideas with the recent Mothman.

With all THAT setup, I must say that Berry disappoints. She does well enough slogging through the setup, but she is unwisely directed away from the rural blackness that could really have provided scaffold for this richness. Except for some strong jungle evocation in the first sex scene, she acts 'white.' A few slang terms and emotions (mostly about her son) are a poor substitute for an investment in thinking and speaking as genuine rural Georgia black.

She seems completely unaware of what this situation demands, of setting these places for recovery at the end. So when we are given the big final scene, it doesn't deliver the power it might have. Three graves, ice cream, service station, outside the house, sharing spoons, recalled drawings, sex, comfort, 'correction,' resignation, 'execution,' prostitution, service, that scene as the last walk. All these and some others were establishing points that we might have seen in her face and manner, in the acceptance of the spoon.

There are less than a dozen actors alive capable of doing this, none African-American. My money on the first black woman to hit this level will be Phina Oruche from the UK. No beauty queen -- someone who is coming up through what real actors need to.

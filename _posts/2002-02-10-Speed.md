Spoilers herein.

Seeing this film in 2002 is a lesson in the moving baseline for thriller films. When this was new, it thrilled. Now it is tame.

It is a matter of escalating notions of pacing and threat. A busload of people is small potatoes in a post 9-11 world. Hopper himself has increased the drama of his villains. But the biggest change is our expectations of how the camera moves. I think de Palma's 'Mission Impossible,' was the biggest raising of the bar in this regard.

Terrorist bombmakers always use the same color coding in their wires?

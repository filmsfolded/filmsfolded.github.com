Spoilers herein.

The purest and most powerful of films are films about films, especially the subset that  are about the making of themselves. Such endeavors often provide windows into our  souls by tricking us into perverting the truth as we judge someone else doing the same.

This one has some particularly strong material to work with, strong material with  historical resonance and driven by a usually powerful actor. But in typical HBO fashion, it  is so watered and dumbed down that the cleverness is reduced to a mere stain. Along  the way, they twist the truth around in precisely the way they demean. Don't these  people pay attention to their own moral?

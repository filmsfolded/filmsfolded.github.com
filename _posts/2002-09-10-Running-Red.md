Spoilers herein.

Cat's eye comments follow*.

This is a film about a woman (played by Lisa Arturo, one of the faux lesbians from 'American Pie 2') who works as a scientist in a secret plant in California developing outlawed biological weapons. She has many personal problems and has been through several marriages, murdering her last one in a fit of pique. Because her work is so unique and valuable, the authorities covered it up and placed her next door to a Russian defector (played by Jeff Speakman). That aging defector (code named Running Red) did not supply any useful intelligence to the CIA so has to 'earn' his keep by looking out for his neighbor. He is having an affair with her, here noted by her stealing his 'banana.' His .

His daft wife has no idea of his past, his soured deal with the CIA or his affair with the neighbor, despite her hints. She is played by Angie Everhart who doesn't even know she is in a movie and believes her husband has had a job for the last ten years.

The story is rather predictable. Old Soviet special ops buddies show up. They kill his lover (the woman he was supposed to protect), so he kills them. Along the way, we never know whether the resurfaced Russians are in cahoots with the CIA or not. Sometimes they seem to take control of the whole movie, for instance when the hero Greg is sent on a wild goose chase into literally another movie: a bus lures him out of 'Running Red' into 'Red Heat' in an attempt to fool him into thinking their purpose, one of Russian law enforcement. A bus gets hit by a train.

All this oblique storytelling is symbolized by Greg's ability to shoot around corners by having bullets bounce off mirrored surfaces. This narrative is challenging and not for the simpleminded; for instance, many viewers may miss the importance of the bug exterminator.

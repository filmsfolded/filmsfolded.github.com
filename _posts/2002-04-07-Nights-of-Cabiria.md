Spoilers herein.

I suppose there are many who believe this to be a character study, or perhaps social criticism. I don't think so -- I believe this to be Fellini's first film concerned with the nature of what film is: part prostitution, part promised miracle; part mesmerised fantasy; part romantic pretense.

And that's how this film is constructed, four set pieces dealing with these four ideas:

-- The film actor as reluctant prostitute

-- The masses flocking to the madonna based on the magic of the ritual performance

-- The audience being hypnotized by watching someone be hypnotized

-- The play that is behind love, and all it is, is a play for money (which connects to the small sequence in the beginning)

This is definitely worth watching, and it has historical significance as well. But I think it s pretty weak Fellini so far as the visual elements and the narrative adventure. So many of the dramatic metaphors are peculiarly Italian -- somehow they don't translate to the universal as well as say the Japanese of Kurosawa.

Spoilers herein.

My favorite films are self-referential. I love this stuff.

Some films are deliberately self-referential, like films about filmmaking or acting. But some are accidentally so, say a film about not being superficial (so as not to be trivial) which itself is superficial and trivial. There are lots of these.

This film is accidentally self-referential. It is about the pitfalls of vanity and is itself vain. It is about a Burton/Taylor romance during the time of the Burton/Taylor romance. But most of all it is about how easy it is to manipulate the public with images.

Egypt's rulers hung on hundreds of years past the glory era purely on the power of image. Rome's politics at this time was similarly determined by the crafty propaganda of a media elite to prop up vacuous leaders. Fast forward to 1960 where the art of film was at an all time low, the good films essentially the ones we were told were good. The film's cost is largely a result of graft and fraud on the part of the modern Romans (now incapable of governing themselves stably) who exploited the situation.

The film is about poor administration of an empire and itself is an example of similar mismanagement. As a result, the moral of the story in the film is that enterprises like this film should be horrid. It is. Some scenes do have good acting (McDowall, Burton), but they are of the broad theatrical kind which was inappropriate then and laughable now. Some photography is impressive, but the eye of the camera is dead, uncreative. Taylor may have cast a spell on audiences prior to this, but she looks fat, pasty and bitchy to me. Things that should move well (like battle and crowd scenes) don't. All the filmmaking skills that are apparent in 'Gladiator,' for instance, are missing here. What's left is more important to cultural anthropology than film criticism.

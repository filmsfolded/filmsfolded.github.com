What we have is a collaboration between two people. They are lovers in a way, struggling to create something special where otherwise they would be engaged in more normal things. Those more normal things involve travelling wellworn byways. 

But this union requires a certain amount of deceit, uncomfortable deceit. 

Such is the story here and the also the story of the creators of the story. 

Kieslowski usually does a more delicate weaving of the two than is here. This is still excellent storytelling -- paced disclosures are the order of the thing. But it is lesser Kieslowski and I actually ask my friends to put this toward the bottom of their decalogue list.

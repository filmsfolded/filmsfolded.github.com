Spoilers herein.

Yup, the production values stink. Yup, the thing is juvenile: death and sex, plus poop jokes.

But I got into this. That's because, like 'Coven,' it takes itself seriously. Its not camp, where it is bad and knows it. Its bad, and soldiers on. Its juvenile and honestly so. Its no different than Kevin's movies, except with a lower budget.

Neither this nor Clerks is as good as 'May' which deals with much the same perspective. Snowballs, glass.

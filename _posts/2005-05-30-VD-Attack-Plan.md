This is a fairly uninteresting little film in itself. What's interesting is that it reflects just how far the enlightenment of the late sixties went. This was produced by Disney, directed by one of their oldest hands and narrated by Keenan Wynne. It was intended for high school "health" class.

It is informative without actually mentioning sex or showing any genitalia or even nudity... or for that matter any humans at all except for restroom symbols. This is preAIDS and focuses mostly on syphilis.

But the amazing thing is that the religious right has swung the pendulum extremely far from advising schoolkids of anything having to do with sex. So Disney has gone to extremes to eliminate any record that this ever existed, because it mentions condoms, well after soap, penicillin and abstinence.

As I write this, there is still a boycott on all things Disney by the religious right. That's more than enough reason to watch this, just in defiance.

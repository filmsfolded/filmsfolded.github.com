Spoilers herein.

No one wants Gilliam to succeed as much as I, even over this distance of time. He has an architectural imagination, places his sophisticated humor at the metalevel, and on this project had the support of the 'spiritual' Beatle. So each time I come to it, I base the experience on an overly generous acceptable of the world he creates.

The story is as much about himself as anything, I suppose, with his being swept into one world after another 'stealing' this and that.

He has succeeded on only one project, I think - 'Fear and Loathing.' Until then, he tried something beyond his grasp: the notion that the world has charmingly incoherent (and funny) pockets. Or that there are hidden layers in ordinary reality that just need the right eye. Or even in Brazil, the rather common twist that of the other way around - that reality is the illusion. Only in 'Fear' is this collapsed to a simple mechanism of a wholly created world in the mind of a brilliant, drug-addled madman. On that he could have finally approached the more ambitious 'Don Quixote' from the other side as it were.

One of the touchstones on that path is this project. Some visual imagination, but one gets the impression that none of the vignettes realized that flash of inspiration he had before his attention swooped off in another direction. The 'play with' idea - always the safe haven for self-reference - is here a Punch and Judy play. I don't know whether we have to wait until he is dead before we start synthesizing his work into one huge movie of large chunks similar to the smaller chunks in each one. But if we did, that Punch and Judy play would be replaced by the larger 'Munchausen' play.

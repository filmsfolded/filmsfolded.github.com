Spoilers herein.

Following Johnny Depp around can be quite a chore. This fellow likes challenges, and could develop into a Penn. But he does muck through some strange stuff on the way.

Here he is again with Olin, though they share no scenes. This is a walk. (The film has no depth at all beyond showing some presumably lovable characters.) Their last outing together was a pretty interesting trip, with a real director. Depp is like many actors I suppose: alternating between dumb stuff for money and projects that he cares about.

Everything in this film is borrowed from other films which do it better. (Except the spice thing, which SM Gellar, Demi Moore and Penny Cruz did even worse, Mary Stuart Masterson a little better.)

Seeing Olin and Binoche together again reminds of how intelligent films can be, how genuinely transformative. Just not here. Not here. Depp works a lot. But we don't see much of Olin these days, and when we do, it is unchallenging stuff. Mystery Men? She really has an otherworldly carriage. Wouldn't this film have been better with the roles reversed (Binoche and Olin), and with the focus on the boy (and all his presumed sexual comings of age) instead of the Mayor?

Could it have been better if we discovered something of the loves abandoned in each preceding town? Perhaps if Depp's character were really given something to do. One wonders, because this is the director of 'Gilbert Grape,' so one knows he's not a simpleton., and has used Depp as an artist.

So one wonders, if the pairings of Binoche and Olin, Olin and Depp, Depp and Hallstrom each resulted in such fine films, why is this one so vapid?

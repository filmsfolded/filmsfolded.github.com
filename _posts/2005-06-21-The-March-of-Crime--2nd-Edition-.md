The first of this series was a faux "lesson" to parents. The march in that film was the march of errant children toward deviant brutality. It must have been a huge success, because it spawned a whole category.

This is the next in the series, and it drops the lesson to parents. Instead, it gets to the brutal and salacious details of one case. It happens to be one that they had film on: a teen kidnapping, torture, rape murder and mutilation. The "march" in this edition is the constant march of characters like this guy against us reg'lar folks.

Because it lacks the hypocritical wrapper of the previous one, this exploitation project is even less interesting. It kidnaps us.

The news footage seems to have originally been silent, having placards for text. Oddly, the editing here is so rough that it contains snippets of those, and not just in a few places.

Spoilers herein.

The gold in this project is the sought-after gold of the unexpected success of the first film. The magic of that success came from the rare alignment of factors that allowed Jack Palance to actually have an effect.

So, okay you're the writer. What do you do? bring back a copy of Curly of course and have the whole cast and crew go in search of whatever accident that made Curly shine the first time around. They don't find it. Actually , they think they do, but it ain't real.

Nic Cage is a minor talent, whose only two tolerable performances are here and in 'Moonstruck.' And that's because he finds himself in a well-crafted film.

I have nothing to say about the plot except to remark that its true purpose is to establish itself as a yearly income stream instead of the other seasonal offerings we've adopted as tradition. Its reason for being is therefore contrary to its stated moral, sullying the whole enterprise.

Special notice should be taken of four participants.

Tea Leone shows real acting talent here. She conveys multiple emotions in each face shot where Cage can put on only one. You'd think he'd insist on not being outshone. I hadn't noticed her before, but she impresses here. Much of the time is working on simple appeal, but there are complex moments.

I recently saw 'Proof of Life' which had an Elfman score that completely misunderstood the film. Here, he is a much better match. He works a lot with honks and squeeks which works well in this sort of moral comedy.

The little girl has been coaxed into a few magic moments. One: 'I knew you'd come back,' is pure syrup, but two others are alone touching enough  Let's hope they don't haunt her.

The writers have done a good job in hitting the marketing center, by rehashing Dickens and Capra with just a little 'Groundhog' freshness. Just a little because this is the one job where too much freshness would be off-putting. The one 'modern' touch is the alternative universe glimpse which thankfully isn't explained. (What happens to the children when this glimpse blinks out?)

Bottom line: this is a minor film. But it does not aspire to be a good film, only a competent entry in the commercial Christmas race. It does well at this, and one must admire the craft. Dickens was a crass commercialist after all and he had a big hand in inventing Christmas -- basing it on on lowbrow sentimentality.

They give us a story about how evil it is to sell out to Hollywood -- to take the life out something wonderful -- and then do it! I just last night saw a much better film ("Almost Famous") which made the same point and then transgressed in the same way. Do they think we won't notice?

About ten years ago, Demi Moore -- then being pushed as sexy -- tried a similar film: "The Butcher's Wife." Also rancid.

I can just hear the pitch: Latin magical realism meets food and sex; we'll go lush and have a date-movie ending as the girl faces her real values. Lots of gay humor...can't miss. We don't need to waste money on A-list writers and directors since we've got Penelope.

I hear a third of this movie was cut so that they could squeak it past the test audiences. Too bad. As Jennifer Lopez shows, a pretty nonactor Latin can be pretty much fun in film ("Out of Sight"). Bossa Nova (actually this music is more the samba from the south of Brazil) has real appeal (Try "Tango" for a Latin music success). There's lots of possibilities in food (try "Eat, Drink, Man Woman") in sex and and in magic. How could they miss? Poor writing, directing and acting.

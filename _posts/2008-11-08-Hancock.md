I viewed this unwillingly. Will Smith projects give me the willies. Like many other big budget productions the economics drive decisions of safety that suck all the novelty and risk out of a project. It isn't that I dislike Will; he's a likable product. Its just that any movie that chooses him probably would not be worth watching.

And this isn't for the first two thirds. Its a simple joke repeated over and over and we settle in patiently looking at our watches until we can escape. Even the movie lobby would be richer we think. And then the story takes an unlikely turn. Perhaps you will know and expect it. I did not and it had its full impact on me. We learn at the same time that our bum-hero learns the truth about his situation and a whole cosmos of new -- action annotated -- dynamics opens up. Now, if you haven't seen this, the new dynamics aren't particularly valuable on their own terms, but coming after we have been lulled, coming after what is essentially a childish setup -- it petty darn marvelous. And it isn't stupid.

Basically the idea is that the gift of power, if held in a partnership, makes that partnership ever so much more attractive and valuable, even essential. But at the same time it pulls out the forces that drive the special power. This is not a trivial dynamic. It is not from the "good versus evil and good wins because it is the biggest badass in town" school, though the wrapper is.

Charlise Theron's attractions actually work for her in this partnership we see, because it is not a partnership we are in. The asymmetries of all situations are amplified because of the Will-Charlise dynamic and we become more aware that we bring little else to the table other than our 9 bucks.

I liked it. I think it works. I hope you did not read this before seeing it so that it can work for you.

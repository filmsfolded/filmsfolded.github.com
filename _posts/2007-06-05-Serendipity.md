Often I spend my time with a movie outside of it, watching me watching it, imagining how and why it became what it is.

But every once in a while, I fall into the thing. It succeeds in its intent, to charm me. It happens almost never with date movie because the conventions and expectations are so rigid. That makes them obvious and invites me to step outside. But this worked for me, and it might for you.

I think it is because it does three things. The first is that it is remarkably competent; film-making -- at least this kind -- requires attention to so many elements. This is quite simply one of the most well engineered date movies I have ever seen in terms of those elements. No risks, no innovation, no real art except in the performances. Just polish, skill, craft.

The second is that it unashamedly touches on romance, the heart of romance as well see in movies. Its a rich notion that probably exists only in movies and a few magical times with the person you love -- so you know it is real. But cinema inflates and freezes it for you to hold. Perhaps that is not so wise, but it is what romantic films are about and this plays those keys.

The third thing is what interests me the most. Mind you, I only suss this out afterward. 

I have recently come to appreciate the invention of what I'll call noir, the noir world of fate. Its entirely a movie notion that as we watch, we become gods and goddesses that (perhaps against our wills) change the world we see so that coincidences apply. Often they are unhappy, but noir fate can work the other way as well. Not usually; it takes some clever invention which we have here. Its why there's mention of Cassiopeia. See? (I mean that literally.)

Its such an attractive idea, that two souls are fated to meet, (one a film producer, the other an analyst). They were born to be together, born alike in some fundamental way. The world will contrive to make the natural fit. Its something to yearn for, and that's what date movies are for: a pinnacle of happiness in love.

This captured me. I suppose it was fate. I wish something similar for you.

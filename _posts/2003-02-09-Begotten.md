Spoilers herein.

This film is about its voyage into our minds, and it gets more competent as the steps get closer to us. The least artful element is the actual acting and shooting. The selection and processing of images is very nice. In fact, I used this (extremely slowed down) as the background of my word processing environment, producing some strange text indeed.

But at that point on its voyage to us, this starts to become a special work. The image is defaced and obscured, to further mirror the story about our own ineffable drive to devise a barrier between ourselves and anything with higher clarity. 

And then this project really takes off with the sound. That sound is not related to the images themselves, but our reinvention of the images. It is in our head, or near to it. Very clever. Very effective.

The story is about the same thing. Powerful folding.

At this writing, Mel Gibson is preparing yet another Sunday School play about Jesus. I'll trade one of these for that any day.

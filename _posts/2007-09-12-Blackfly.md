I think the best humor requires context from outside. That way the viewer does some of the work, adding in bits that make the thing funny. Collaboration in funniness is always the funniest.

The context here is Canadian's notion of their land as a glorious place. Its probably first in terms of self-definition, the purity of their souls conflated with the purity of their place. From this comes their patient tolerance, even with Frencies, and their gentle place as humanitarians in the world.

It is a glorious place of course, in many respects and absolutely in comparison to its neighbor.

That's what a viewer, and especially a Canadian viewer would bring to this, a simple, unending torture that a place visits on a man.

Really funny. The jaunty song adds.

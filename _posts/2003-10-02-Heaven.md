Spoilers herein.

All movies are about other movies, never life.

Kieslowski made a career out of making films that take a national filmmaking style and  twisting them to new purposes, letting us know he is doing so in the process. 'Three  Colors' was as much about French filmmaking and the French national character as it  was the stories within. That business about watching with the watching creating  accidents of fate...

He planned a similar trilogy that worked with Italian themes in life, but especially Italian  filmmaking. Italian films are about the freshness of captured impulse, about excessive  emotion and excessive theatricality expressing that emotion for the screen. About  characters, never situations. About talking, often with overlapping threads. About the  magic of place created by the magic of people.

KieslowskiÂ‘s method (like Ang Lee's method) is to come ever so close to the soul of the  thing but be different in ways that matter but don't necessarily show. That's why you end  up haunted by something that seems ordinary.

In this case, we have the importance of family but it is outside of the peer pressure that  drives the thing in Tuscany. We have the magic of the land, but it is magic that the  characters enter by transcending it rather than the 'normal' way of creating it in the soil  by presence.

But most of all, we have passion almost exclusively without words. We have love driving  fate and not the other way around. We have emotional minimalism down to the music.  We have Griebe's odd colors like frescos instead of real earth. We have always the threat  that this is really magical rather than real.

To make this work requires an actress who can pull the entire world with her. The less  noise she makes, the more we hear. Cate Blanchett is one of the three most powerful,  multilayered actresses alive, and possibly the only one whose scalp could become the  whole landscape. Watch how much she does with so little actual motion. She's changing  the way we dream.

BillyBob wrote 'The Gift' as if he really meant it, and with the same two actors created  something blunt.

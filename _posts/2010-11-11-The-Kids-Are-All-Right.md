This is extremely good movie-making, movie-making of the sort that is centered on relationships. The relationships shape the characters rather than the other way around, and from this situations spin. All feeds back to the relations and all depends on the actors, one actress in particular. She knows and delivers. Moore is one of our very best actors.

The situation is that a lesbian couple use a sperm donor. One of them takes the experiences and is able to build a real enough human framework to begin making a film. She is lucky enough to have engaged Moore before she starts, and she brings Ruffalo. They worked well -- and well with children -- on "Blindness." Together they attract Bening to perform what already is her standard role. These are three very fine actors who know the secret language of creating and projecting relationships first before doing the usual thing of finding their characters.

The young filmmaker lets them go and they develop a very, very fine film, excepting the ending. Let's talk about that first.

The arc of the thing is in the developing of a crisis. In the world of the film as well as in the world of the actors, identity comes purely from relationships and we watch as the relationships are eroded and identities threatened. This is, in other words, not at all like the standard ("I Am Love" is an apt example), where human souls are muted and damaged, and where dynamics play out in the relationships. I do not believe it was intended, but the lesbian/IVF slant works the way science fiction often does, to show truth by shifting it from the normal a little. 

The way that we see things come apart shows us the Legos of identity, and it is pretty darn uncomfortable watching because it rings so true. But because -- I suppose -- of financiers we have a "happy" ending that seems to have been built for a different film, even a different world. This ending starts when Julianne's character turns off the TeeVee and apologizes to her family in precisely the same way that Nic Cage does in "Family Man," and similar paper characters do in thousands of other films. We then have a domestic scene showing the happily ever after tone that simply jars. 

So get up and leave the theater when Julianne grabs the TeeVee remote. You will leave in a state of suspension woven by three fine actors doing something relevant, powerful and by a different presentation than usual. If you choose to stay, at least pay attention to how the skateboard is used by the kid used to doing the heavy lifting in a family of women.

Julianne likes these sorts of acting challenges and has since "Vanya on 42nd St." This approach to acting is not about creating a soul, it is about connecting with an audience and you do that by connecting with on-screen beings in a similar way. 

The setup is easy: traditional family exists. Yeah, I know they are gay and the kids were artificially started. But the template is standard, with all the tensions you find in a normal family. As the film progresses, we see the joints opened by tensions. The catalyst is an outsider who opens those joints so he can splice his own identity in. There is a biological analogy.

Within this setup, Julianne is the character we follow and it is through her that we are connected to her connections. Her to her partner and kids, is in the foreground and they among each other in a background. Watch the millions of nuances, they placing of self in a way that includes us. This is far more engaging and effective than, say, Streep's consistent approach.

And there is some film filmmaking as well. One shot stands out. We have met Ruffalo's character and know his world. We see him in the foreground in that world in a framing taken from Antonioni: perfect balance in the elements around and behind him. He is at peace in this world he has built. Into an unfilled space in the frame enter the two teenagers entering his world for the first time. The cinematic vocabulary here took my breath away.

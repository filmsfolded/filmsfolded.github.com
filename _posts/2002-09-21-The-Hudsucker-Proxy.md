Spoilers herein.

The Coens are not the basis of my life in film, but they sure make it a lot of fun. Its like a crossword puzzle that dances through your memory by teasing you with clues that you use to assemble a pre-engineered interlocking marvel.

I believe a Coen project has three elements and they build it that way. They begin with a major problem in narrative. These are well known; most have to do with the identity of the narrator, specifically names or roles. For this film, it is the fated role; for 'Lebowski,' the name; for 'Man who Wasn't,' it is recognition; in 'Brother,' we had fate again but this time targeted on opportunity (rather than vehicle) for narration.

The second element is the selection of the cinematic cloak to wear. I believe this is wholly unrelated to the first, in fact the arbitrariness is part of the fun. In 'Man' it was noir; 'Brother' adopted the indigenous narrative song (which led to both Homer and Teebone Burnette); here it is screwball. And not just today's screwball. When these guys mine, they go to the source lode and in this case it is Capra. In fact, I believe they started with Capra's original screwball, 'It Happened One Night.' There, the man is a fast-talking news reporter who attaches himself to a popular phenomenon as a personality. The woman is successful (in terms of being rich anyway) and she masquerades as a 'regular' girl. Turn that inside out and you get the outline for this. Add some other Capraisms and the gods in the machines and this is what comes out.

Oh, and the third element: pure cinematic experience. Visual metaphors, extreme images, manifold quoting, almost distractingly detailed sets. Here, all the actors support these three elements, and that is the marvel of Coen projects. Many other films really do believe that the story and the 'quality' of the actors in making it real somehow carries power. This is much better, being rooted in intelligent inquiry and love of visual imagination.

Robbins and Newman support this type of acting well. They have done so before. But there is always one actor at least that the Coens use as the white space: the actor that only knows about one dimension of the project. Here, that is Ms Leigh. Even though she is being goofed on, she does the best work of her career.

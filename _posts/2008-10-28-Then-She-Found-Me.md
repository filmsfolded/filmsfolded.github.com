Poor Helen. She falls into three traps here, and we have to suffer with her.

The first trap is one that has become a rather tiresome observation. Being very good at acting provides nearly no basis for being a competent filmmaker. Indeed, since the concerns are so different, it is often the case that in stepping over the line, an actor carries the wrong values and messes up the project. An actor is all about push, about delivery, about richness. The actor's job is to be powerful, effective even when subdued.

The filmmaker's job is to take away, to sculpt the world of possibilities to give us a narrative that we can fondle. The filmmaker takes away much of what the actor gives, so that the actor can fit into a larger enterprise and be effective. Without that shaping we get 90 minutes of auditions.

Hunt, like so many other actors, falls into this trap.

But long before that she, or her sponsors, made a fatal error in thinking that they could get away with amateurish cinematography. She probably felt that the camera is only there to catch the actors, so art or craft was not especially required. Wrong. This is painful on the eyes.

There is another problem as well. The source material isn't particularly novel or difficult. But it has a certain structure that makes it work. Its not a simple structure. It depends first on a notion of pain being required for happiness. This is purportedly a Jewish wisdom, and likely is common in the American post-holocaust culture. This is conveyed as the basic cosmology into which this adopted child (now an adult) finds herself.

Then the story itself builds on the symmetries of belonging: she wants a child. Her mother who gave her up wants a child. There are two men in her life who represent aspects of childishness and who convey dialog about the nature of motherhood.

This structure matters. Its what makes narrative work. Its is the skeleton of the shape that the filmmaker must sculpt around, using vision first. Hunt misses this.

Colin Firth is such a likable guy, he almost makes some of this tolerable.

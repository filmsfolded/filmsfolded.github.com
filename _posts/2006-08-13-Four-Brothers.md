Each of us dies a bit when a presumed young talent is confirmed to be ordinary.

Early in a career, sheer energy can impress. There's a reach that boldness, even arrogance, gives you. I was hopeful in this case, and particularly for this film, in part because he finally was given a-list talent to work with. He could have done anything.

Unfortunately, he decided to do everything. He decided to make bits of four movies and in each case he merely borrows.

I've been thinking about this with my creative partner, about this business of cliché and originality. There's a value to cliché: it speeds the introduction, it settles the viewer quickly and makes things easy to read, to follow.

It sets a pattern which if you are clever you can modulate in some way and be recognized for stepping outside the ordinary by using the ordinary. You CAN be amusing using cliché and shorthand. Naturally you skirt stereotypes and with lots of material like this, you can't avoid them.

But if you really want to be worthwhile, you do have to be original. You must. You must have enough confidence to make something new and send it out.

I suppose each viewer will make their own decisions about who matters in their lives. But someone who utters borrowed phrases can't tell you anything useful, or moving.

Can they?

I you are discouraged at the state of the world, at the general inability of folks to reason, then you won't want to visit this.

It is a mystery series, which means that it places itself in the domain of "thinking viewers'" material. These do have murders, and sleuths, but there's little detection though the women involved do stumble onto the "solution."

The very shape of the thing is a bit offensive. BBC mysteries have long had two vales in mind: make the place interesting and make some characters the viewers will like.

In this first episode, we are introduced to the "detectives" thus derived. Its a simple matter of looking at demographic charts: two women around 60, disgusted with men. One is blond, pretty, fit, and very smart. The other is dumpy and dull. Neither is scheduled for a romance.

The blond Rosemary drives an old land rover and doesn't want a newer one because of the "girlie" things that were added. I expect as we plod through this series, the characters will evolve based on what the producers think is a sweet spot. Its really offensive, as if what we watch had only a few major parts to fill and designers of these amusements could plug in what they want.

The three major parts are the women, the "murder mystery," and the place.

This episode has a really very appealing place. And it has a reference to the only watchable thing I have ever seen from TeeVee, "The Singing Detective" in a man with eczema. 

Otherwise, this is a slap in face.

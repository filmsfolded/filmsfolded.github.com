Spoilers herein.

'Nurse Betty' is something special, a high watermark in the abstract reasoning it  demands of an audience. The complexities of what is real and fiction are pretty folded.

'Betty' relies on this, and this relies on 'Tootsie.' But of the three, this is the only one  that is actually fun to watch. That's because it is structured to encourage the sort of  hammy acting it satirizes. And these players know what to do: Kline is always clever in  his narrow way (he had actually just done a 'Hamlet' of the type he goofs about), but  Whoopie and Sally are at the top of their game in an Almodovar-ian way. That's where  you reflect the layering of the plot (a soap about a soap) on the style of acting.

Sally deserved better roles. She knows how to do folded acting, even the kind where one  fold is serious and the simultaneous other is comedic. Here, the whole cast - especially  Downey - is in on the joke.

I am convinced that most of the players, and especially Sally, were doped up.

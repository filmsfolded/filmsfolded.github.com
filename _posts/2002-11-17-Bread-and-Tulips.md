Spoilers herein.

Screwball is a most effective approach but it is delicate as well; it cannot be stretch willy-nilly for other purposes, and that's what is tried here.

Screwball characters have to have a certain charmed abstraction, be pure and distinct from reality. Unfortunately, Italian comedies (like comedies of many nations) are central to the definition of what it means to be Italian. And that depends on a pseudo-reality of the characters. One cannot have characters that are unreal and real at the same time -- at least without great skill -- and that's why this fails.

But along the way, we have all the points from the screwball playbook: the 'performance' (here via an accordion), the reporting at a distance (the comical cell phone) and the finding of true love. They just don't register.

Sure it is unbiblical, but that's not the point, at least my point. (So much of the New Testament was fabricated anyway.) This is instead a simple matter of unwisely trusting the actor's viewpoint.

There are two worlds in the community of film-making. One world is the world of the composer, someone who worries about the multidimensional effect of the thing. In this world, before you start, you engineer the narrative stance, the physics of the world involved and the identity of the camera. You confabulate dozens of things before finding the niche that the actor fills. If you are lucky you'll find actors that are (1) intelligent enough to understand what you are doing and talented enough to collaborate (2) compliant enough to do what the filmmaker wants without understanding (or usually caring) or (3) someone who has a pre-existing persona that fits the niche.

Nearly all actors are of type 2 and 3, which means that they are the last people who really know what a movie is all about. Australia has institutionally made a commitment to producing actors of type 1. So we have the very, very best of our film actresses through that school, and some fine male actors as well.

But not Mel, alas. He's just as thick as an Alabama pancake. Even though he learned the craft of directing from Peter Weir, he's not picked up Weir's balanced approach. Weir works from both ends: from the composition as a whole (see the masterful "Hanging Rock" for an example of this) as well as from the "Scorcese" end where all the physics of the world come from the characters.

When Gibson did "Braveheart" he was able to hide this weakness in the massive battle scenes which for a movie of that type IS the structure in a way. But not here. What we have is no composition outside the dynamics of the people, even though scripture and subsequently layered legends provide plenty.

This is the worst of film: a film made by an actor based on solely an actor's perspective... based on a story that discards everything in the rich rich world (even if you limit it to the Bible) except the individual, one individual. Regardless of what you believe, Jesus deserves a better film, from a real filmmaker.

(These two worlds of film have analogs in religion: one side has a complete cosmology based in different degrees on faith, grace, prayer and good works. The other focuses exclusively on people: Jesus, Mary, saints, sometimes angels and devils.)

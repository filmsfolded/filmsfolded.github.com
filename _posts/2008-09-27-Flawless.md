Its not bad, you know, even though it has essentially two characters: Demi Moore and Michael Caine, neither one known these days for anything remotely interesting. There are a lot of other characters, intended to collectively represent an evil, selfish world. And it is here that the movie works. 

These are diamond traders and the scummy types that work with them. Its a rich lode, because the diamond business is an artificial trade that exploits crevices in the imperfect world of commerce. Often, its not the story at all that matters, it is the domain that is woven, wherein the story happens.

Here the story involves some small mystery that borrows from the original Oceans 11: how were the diamonds transported out. And even that mystery is revealed late and embedded in how the heist surprises us. So the story qualifies as "good enough," essentially a procedural. Demi Moore impresses only by how plain she looks, after decades of working in the other direction.

But its that world of genteel thieves that is pulled off pretty well. There's some miraculous casting here, some very effective lines, and -- unexpectedly -- its all delivered with cinematic competence.

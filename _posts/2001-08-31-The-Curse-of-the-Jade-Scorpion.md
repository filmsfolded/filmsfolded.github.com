Spoilers herein.

Woody is uneven, that's no news. The amazing thing is the variety in which are considered the good ones. By my yardstick, 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' is sophomoric drek, and 'Sweet and Lowdown' is one of the cleverest films made. (Both had excellent actors as anchors.)

Here comes the latest which starts out with Woody the writer/director's curse: Woody the actor. Usually, he gets in the way of his vision as a writer. This time, he writes better for himself as an actor: lots of physical comedy designed for his gawky mannerisms -- lots and lots of one-liners, so rapid and numerous its hard to imagine them popping out in his couple-week writing drills.

Its amusing. See it.

Woody is a director of situations not actors or effects. He just collects good actors and assumes they know what to do. Altman works this way too, Problem is that good actors have different acting styles, and the better ones really diverge. Without a common vision to guide them, those differences can whip you from one world to the other.

Thus we have Akroyd's ironic delivery next to Hunt's very clean honesty. We have Wallace Shawn's mastery of playing several dimensions simultaneously next to Woody's broad japes. If you are a serious watcher, this strobing of realities will make you dizzy (dizzy bad not good as in 'Moulin Rouge').

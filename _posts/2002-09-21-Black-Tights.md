Spoilers herein.

This film is truly dreadful, and I say that as an enthusiast of dance and the dance film.

Some of the dancing is fine, but most of the choreography looks half finished or borrowed from elsewhere. The music surely is and appears to have been whipped together and performed overnight between some real engagement. It is so bad everything goes better with no sound.

And that's true of Chevalier, who does a cartoon of himself. If he weren't dead serious, it would be funny. The camera and editing are universally bad -- one can get away with a lot in ordinary films, but there is little margin for blunt imagination in filming dance.

The colors and sets are apt. Cyd and Moira are stunning.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

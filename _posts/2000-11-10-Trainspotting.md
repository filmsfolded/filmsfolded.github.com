Why was this made? Because someone felt that there was a market for an edgy film. This is edgy, but mostly in cheap ways: scat, death, desperation, loneliness. Lots of character shots of the different dumb ones. So it delivers what it intended.

Is that enough? To judge from the IMDB comments, it is also a convincing antidrug film. Is that enough? McGregor is a promising actor but even that is not enough (see him in "Pillow Book" if you are looking for REAL edge).

Sorry. I think this film is relatively artless, and the cinematic tricks are at the music video level.

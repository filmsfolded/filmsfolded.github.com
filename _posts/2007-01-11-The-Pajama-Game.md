The container that this movie gives us is completely mundane. More, it would be a waste of your life, a sin, to watch it except for one person, Carol Haney.

Her story is that she was a dancer, a good one. A very good one who became Gene Kelly's assistant, and who taught several of his partners to dance. When we watch those old dance movies and marvel at these woman, what we see is an imperfect copy of Carol.

She was able to go to Broadway as a performer and was a success, which led her to a secondary role in this movie. After beginning, a role was rewritten to accommodate her.

During the filming of this, she suffered bodily damage and additionally was diagnosed as diabetic. She died shortly afterward, her body used up. So this -- three musical numbers -- is all we have. Two are absolutely amazing, the result of her collaboration with choreographer Bob Fosse. These would make his career.

So, I am recommending you watch this piece of trash, this horrible thing, for those two numbers so you can be exposed to someone special. She deserves it and you do too.

But there's a bittersweet pleasure in watching, a sort of noir cloak we put on as the cost of admission. Because this woman is making something for herself and us that is destroying her.

Why? Why do we value damage? Billie, Judy, Janis as singers, valued because they risked everything. Not every time, but when they do and they touch outside their safe boundaries, they touch outside ours as well in some way. But dance is ever so much more explosive because each time with someone like this, each time the body risks damage that can be permanent -- a life of pain for one instant of shared performance.

Look at this and see. Its so far beyond the usual that you feel honored, blessed, adventurous.

It does matter, You do connect. It is something beyond amusing us, even though we both pretend it is mere "entertainment." The blessing of film is that we didn't have to physically be there, that we can experience this after this woman has died. For us.

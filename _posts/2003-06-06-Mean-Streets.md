Spoilers herein.

Scorsese is a talented man, no question. This is - I believe - his purest film, the one that is the least constrained by external conventions and pressures - the one that echoes through everything that follows.

There are lots of basic philosophies in approaching filmmaking. I continue to be amazed at how radically they differ and how comfortably they are accommodated in film. That leaves us to sort out which one fits who we are or want to be. After all, we as viewers owe it to the filmmakers to be a skilled in viewing as they are in their arts.

Scorsese is an Italian storyteller. That's where the characters are everything. All life and motion in the universe comes not from a nature, an environment, a metaphysic, but from people. They create situations, the environment springing from their eyes rather than the other way around. An Italian storyteller himself gets in your face and never relents, following you down the street, poking your shoulder with two fingers. There's a threat of violence in his eye, and this permeates all that is created. Sex is a story. Death is a story. Crime is a story.

An Italian filmmaker attaches his camera to the characters by a string. It moves as they do. There is no disembodied observer as with most other filmmakers, this observer is an invisible character who tags along - because there are no entities other than characters in his world.

What you get is a certain honesty, directly descended from 'The Bicycle Thief.' What you also get is an inordinately heavy reliance on the actor who selves both as narrator and the observed. ('Taxi Driver' would take this to the extreme with no scene not being something observed or imagined by DeNiro's man.) But in the scheme of powerful filmmaking, that's pretty thing gravy. That's why I was particularly interested in 'Gangs,' which can be seen as 'Mean Streets' with architecture and situation outside any character. Weinstein (the dope) forced Scorsese to more of a story, less political drama and muted chaos. Everything in between these two films is uninteresting.

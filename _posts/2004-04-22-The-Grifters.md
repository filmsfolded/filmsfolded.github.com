Spoilers herein.

Yes, you already know that the presentation values, the acting and such, is superb in this  project. But that is _never_ enough. What we need is some engagement with the story  modifying the distance between the screen and your mind. It has to play with that  relationship in some way.

The con is the technique of first resort. And there are an amazing variety of ways that the  con can be used to confabulate the story: who is defining and telling the story.

The people involved claim that they focus only on the 'Greek tragedy for the underclass.'  They mention it constantly in the DVD commentary and Scorsese deeply believes it as  well.

But they clearly are interested in the metanarrative (as they were in 'High Fidelity'). Each  of these two women fight for control over what we see. Cusak is only the surrogate.

Only the simplest part of the game is the guessing and the revealed twists.

Spoilers herein.

This project is no more sophisticated than many others of the period, but has become important only in retrospect. As a master's early film, one can see here some fledgling elements that appear throughout his career. Some commenters here note certain visual icons of interest, but what is more import I think is the notion of the camera.

Hitchcock is important because later he developed a new philosophy of the eye. The camera takes on a personality and fluidity that is more than just a ghost or a peephole. His later camera is curious. It questions, sometimes aggressively. This would happen well after this film, but you can see him rolling over some precursor ideas. How many watchers are there in this film? Other than ourselves, basically every major character. How many avengers? Are we among them?

Even in this early film, beyond the lighting and symbolic iconography, he works with shifts and contrasts among the various watchers, and in parallel among the avengers. Not masterful yet -- actually heavihanded -- but clever nonetheless.

I really hate TeeVee. I hate how it has changed news into the most trivial of snips, how it it has transformed politics into the manipulation of narrative, and how it has made it commonplace for advertisers to assault our deepest senses. But most of all, I curse it for the way it drags on film, real film. The very existence of TeeVee means that we are trained differently than we might allow ourselves to be. But when we have a "major" film event and it uses TeeVee conventions, its particularly repellent.

Pop music is what it is because of the accident of how the market has evolved to make money from it. You have to buy an artifact to "own" the music. At least that used to be the case, and even today that model is still clung to by the "music business." Because the idea is not to provide music, but to sell artifacts, the music is perturbed. It has developed into a form that suits the market: so many seconds, so few hooks, so much personal charisma or charm. The result is that what we carry in our heads as melodies are little sales viruses that crowd out the transformative power of real music.

TeeVee is worse, because it digs semantically deeper.

The commercial compact with theatrical film is rather straightforward: if something is attractive enough, I will pay. Then I will enter a space designed to eliminate everything but the film. I will engage in a shared world with the filmmaker. During that uninterrupted time, we engage in the long form, something unique, something special, something powerful enough to change lives. I decide what is attractive, what tradeoffs I wish to make and to some extent when.

TeeVee is a different contract. They're interested in attracting me not so I can see the primary narrative, but all sorts of inserted side narrative designed to convince me to buy something. The purpose is not to be whole, singly engaged. In fact it is the opposite, to be serially interrupted. So TeeVee never engages in the long form proper. Instead it builds on small episodes. It gives the illusion of the long form by stringing episodes together and having some large container. 

That large container in the original soap opera are grand sweeps of human interaction: betrayal, scheming, justice. In this case, that is enhanced by large sweeps of war that surround this, provide some notion of flow, and even plot devices that allow tragedy and separation. But its still a soap opera. Its still chunks, little chinks to go between ads and slightly larger chunks to be consumed in an evening. Oh, you may get involved in various characters, but you'll more likely be involved in the accounting process, simply keeping track of who that was that now reappears, and what story they are re-igniting for a little flash before jumping to the next.

If you are like me, you use film as a tool for life; you use narrative and explorations of it as part of a rich adventure with people who can make stories that weave with selves. Its a gift, the biggest we have as humans. If so, if you feel this way. If you depend on art. Then you will be disgusted by the TeeVee travesties of the long form that are shaped only by the crassest of market forces.

This is the first "big" miniseries production, and it is a template for many others that followed. Its probably no worse than many others, but it should be reviled because it was the first. It set the template for all that follow, that allow you to sit and go nowhere with the illusion of motion and with your wallet in your hand.

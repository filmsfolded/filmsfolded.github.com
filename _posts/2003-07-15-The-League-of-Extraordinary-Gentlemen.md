Spoilers herein.

I watch an awful lot of movies, and I seek awful movies as well because they often have  interesting ideas behind them.

This is one of the worst films I have seen all year, and one of the most interesting ideas.

I was really impressed with how 'From Hell' was put together: its notion of a story of a  storyteller telling a story about stories. Depp understands this. Absynthe uniquely  accelerates this. All the rest was just the mechanics of film knocking around.

It was with anticipation that I went into the theater this time: This time, we were to have  a similar additional layer: a fiction involving fictions, and different kinds of fiction!

The characters here a come from radically different literary traditions: reflection, meta- narrative, games with the reader, games with the world, games with the manner of  telling. These are not just different people, they represent wholly different words,  different ways of inventing the world in your mind.

Think of the possibilities. Lynch played a game of two worlds fighting in 'Blue Velvet,'  Greenaway did with 'Cook, Thief,' dePalma in 'Femme Fatale.' But they involved just two  forms of imagination. Here we have five! (not counting Sawyer - he or Huck represents a  legitimate six type of literature, but that's not why he is here). This could have been  something truly astounding, as cinematic as 'Hulk,' and as intellectual as 'Bladerunner.' 

Alas. Sean Connery ruins every project he has been in since he began to believe he  knows something. He consistently fights the director, stays outside of his vision, avoids  collaboration with other actors to seek a groove, and has no patience for cultivating a  rhythm among scenes. This is just a bunch of movie parts, jumbled together, some of  them fertilized but not washed off.

Real movie buffs owe themselves the pleasure of imagining what this could have been,  especially if you know something about Mycroft Holmes, who invents the world by logical  meditation.

No actor here survives embarrassment except Peta. I do not know her, but am told she  worked in a TeeVee copy of the US copy of the French (actually Dutch) 'Nikita.' She has  an easy job, since of all the characters hers is the most entrenched in cinematic  metaphors, and breathy sex is always easy. But at least she found her character: redhead.

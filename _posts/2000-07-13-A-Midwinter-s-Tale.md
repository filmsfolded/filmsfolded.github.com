I love self-referential movies. I love Shakespeare. I love this little film.

The movie itself isn't so great by itself. Alone, it is a quaint dredging up of an old story and a catalog of petty conflicts and emotional turns.

The context is that this is what Branagh did to prepare for his own Hamlet, after the disaster of his pretentious Frankenstein. That film became a Frankenstein's monster. Here he purges his palette.

One stationary camera is used. Middle shots only. Black and white. Adopting all the shorthand of Woody Allen so that there is no originally at all in the filmmaking proper.

The story is what an actor does to collect people and center down for a particularly true Hamlet. And that is precisely what the film is for Branagh, (one of) his methods for centering in on the (particularly true) Hamlet that follows. The few real scenes of Hamlet here are tantalizing.

The Claudius here is Branagh's Polonius, the Hamlet his Laertes (and Zeffirelli's Rosencrantz). I saw this right after seeing Pacino's 'Looking for Richard,' which attempts much the same. But this is graceful, generous to the actors in contrast to Pacino's selfish grab.

I am skeptical of turning Hamlet over to actors to construct from their own relatively small desires and visions. But this convinces of at least powerful contributory effect, both in the story and the existence of the film itself.

Spoilers herein.

By now, you already know that this has a trivial story and apparently childish morales:  'everyone is family,' and 'forgiveness,' and respect for the otherly challenged. You know  that it  seemingly is a second-rate project with a single gimmick. You may even know  about the rather offensively off-putting camp in the performances all around.

But this is still worth watching for two reasons.

The first is that the apparent superficiality is illusory. Casual adult viewers may think the  story is Disney-like, revolving around a simple platitude - a platitude that is one of  those artificial Sunday School truths we think it is good for kids but that no one actually  lives. This is no Disney; in a typical Disney production - say 'Lion King' - there is us  and there is them. We watch them. The world is simple.

Spanish (and Portuguese!) literature since 'Don Quixote' has been founded on a far  richer notion. There's us and the book, and within the book is another observer and an  observed reality. This creates an ambiguity about who we are and whether we are in the  book, or the book is in our world, or (depending on the author) whether the world is  created by the 'writer' in the book.

It is a sophisticated notion. Very complex. When kids are exposed to it, it changes their  facility for abstract reasoning, which is a whole different order of growth than 'do-bee,  don't-bee' moralization.  

And despite apparent simplicities, this is a complex situation: the many versions of  watchers and roles within roles and projections within projections are non-trivial. Forget  about all the wiggling sprites and see what this is all about. Its very structure undermines  its apparent saccharine morale, and makes it different than 'Bullwinkle' and 'Pussycats'  and 'Zoolander.'

Just consider the 'short' at the beginning: hosted by our artificial intelligence guy (Mr.  Lisp - Lisp is the language of AI) who ran a TeeVee show to entrap kids. He shows a  book. The characters in the book are fingerpuppets. He also comments on the upcoming  movie. This is a guy who makes movies, who is in a movie, who is commenting on  another movie - and does so by showing a representation (a book) of another

representation (fingerpuppets), acting out that movie.

And the second reason? the 3-d of course. Now you may think this is unimportant, but  we live in a visual world that is dominated by 2-d images of three dimensional reality.  That means that we have generally lost our architectural awareness. Yes, it seems that  this is all about those few things that come out of the screen. But it is far deeper than  that, even with the primitive technology. This is from a guy who traveled a thousand  miles to see a reconstructed 'Dial M for Murder' played on dual projectors, possibly a  once in a lifetime chance these days.

It matters. If you expose your kids to kiddie films, stick to this, the Pixar projects  ('Nemo' is also about space), and the original Muppet Movie. Now that's parenting  instead of babysitting.

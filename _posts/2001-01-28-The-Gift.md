Some films are worth watching for the rush of being a part of chances that are being taken. Sometimes an artist risks everything and you participate in the danger. And some films (but only a few) are worth watching because they are competent.

This film is the latter. It surpasses 'What Lies beneath' and 'Stir of Echos' by leagues. but not because of the script. The writers took no chances, just plugged away at a formula. BillyBob constantly disappoints.

But the execution is highly competent. Competence is a wonderful thing -- you don't have to even like the film to get an exhilaration from the high level of craft. I had this experience with 'Autumn in New York,' which was a syrupy formula also presented with relentless competence (and which was also punctuated by Simmons). This film is similar except it has a golden center in Ms Cate.

So see it for the craft, and because of Cate. She's a treasure. Not showy. facially quiet.

But there's something else, some negative from Thornton. What would we do without the American South? Our mythical zone where every man is a buffoon or violent lowclass, and every woman is mindless. What would we do without the mist of voodoo and the inference of evil in swamps? Without the hint of incest and the threat of beflagged pickups? Why without these crutches, you'd have to be a real writer. At least BB didn't drag alligators into this one.

He was on my mildly interesting to watch list. Now he is off. As an actor, he has intensity but no depth, rather like Nic Cage. As a director/writer he just follows the playbook, sometimes blindly, Rather like Costner. I'll avoid him in the future. It's his good fortune that a strong group showed up for this film.

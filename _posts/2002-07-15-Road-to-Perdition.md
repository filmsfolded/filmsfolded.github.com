Spoilers herein.

Four and a Half Artists and Two Dupes.

This director understands a secret of casting and how to exploit the weaknesses and strengths of an actor. The story here is framed in terms of two men who know what they are doing, played by Newman and Law. Both are extremely self-aware actors that are able to create a separate whole being beside which they stand and control. In the story, Newman's character has charisma and control. Law's is the surrogate for the filmmaker -- he is gifted, seems to know more than any character, and is concerned with photographing the violent end of people. This is already a signature of Mendez, this newscamera is just like the videojournal of 'Beauty.' Look at how Law has adjusted his posture and walk. (Compare it to how Jennifer Leigh has not and presumably cannot.)

Mendez uses these two as puppeteers who dimly are aware that they themselves are puppets of Hall and Mendez, currently the best pairing of director and cinematographer we have. Below them we have the two hapless characters: Sullivan and son. The genius of this film is that they are played by actors who are not in control, who themselves don't know what Mendez is doing to them. They are victims as actors as well as characters. Many have noted Hanks' limits as an actor here and consider that a flaw. No indeed.

In between the two is the Tucci/Nitti character who is nominally powerful, but himself is subject to forces beyond his control. Look at how his body language is ambiguous, and ambiguously staged.

So I find three things of interest here: 

-- how Mendez understands his actors and passes that information to the actors, 

-- how Conrad is able to take that information and create Tarkovsky-like tone poems that leverage the narrative (watch how Conrad understands Newman's face. Two previous collaborations between this face and camera are in the iMDb top films.

and

-- how this is served back to the viewer as explicit voyeurism in terms of a skulking character.

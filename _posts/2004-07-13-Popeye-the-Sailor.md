Spoilers herein.

Popeye's first cartoon after he matured on the comics page. I believe the Fleischer cartoons  may be the best of the era. Where other pioneers were working with characters abstracted  especially for the screen, the Fleischers gave life to 'real' characters.

Betty Boop until 1934 - when regulatory prudes stripped her of her magic - was an  amazing invention: sexy, somewhat dumb. But the important thing was the flapper persona.

By 33, the Fleischers bought the rights to Popeye and this is the first appearance on screen.  His dumb but endearing masculinity is a perfect match for Betty's similar femininity. She only  appears in a cameo here, except the voice of Olive is very similar (and done by the same  person). Betty was retired in 39, to be replaced by the unplucky, unsexy Olive.

The world of film stereotypes would never be the same. The death of the Clara Bow type  begins with this short.

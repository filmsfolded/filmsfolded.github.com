Spoilers herein.

Yet another film that does precisely what it preaches against. Quite apart from that, and how pretty the 'star' is, there's some interesting energy in the direction. Fosse is a dancer/choreographer, and it shows in subtle ways. For instance the way that Roberts is marginalized in shots he shares with almost everyone.

But he is what keeps the film from working. A more powerful actor would have saturated the entire world with the malevolence to support the flashback framing. This guy is a lightweight.

How could they ever make a film without dealing more with the film/Bogdonovich connection, and his bit with Cybil and Dorothy's little sister.

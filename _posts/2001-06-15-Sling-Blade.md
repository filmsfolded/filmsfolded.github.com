Spoilers herein.

Sly Stallone is a mugger, a selfish actor with little depth who bores with his personality. He wrote directed and starred in his first film, and that film showed an extraordinary cinematic sense. He hogged the camera, but it didn't matter so much since the film had energy.

Billy Bob is a mugger, a selfish actor with little depth who bores with his personality. He wrote directed and starred in his first film, and that film showed an extraordinary lack of cinematic sense. He focuses exclusively on himself annoyingly crowding every scene. He does have the simpleton act down, but that's a slamdunk for an actor.

In viewing this in 2001, one has the advantage of seeing a substantial body of work that has followed. Stallone and Billy Bob. One note actors.

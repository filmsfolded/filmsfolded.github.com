I suppose we should be happy when someone takes the good old sports movie genre and sort of makes a metamovie about it. The assumption with sports movies, and especially the bad news bears variety where the incapable are gathered into the church -- the assumption is that sports imparts the energy of life. That the kind of challenges in sports are larger and tougher and better, more pure than what you find in life. If you have conquered some game, you have conquered life.

The twist this time is that a weak soul, one that falls outside any grace in the real world is brought into the church of sports by a kindly priest. Ed Harris is playing a priest in a coach's suit. He's a real actor, and Cuba and Alfe are too. And it is a bit fun watching them for about 5 minutes.

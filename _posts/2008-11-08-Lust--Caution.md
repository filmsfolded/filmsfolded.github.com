Three things worth noting in this.

First of course is the sheer excellence of the film itself. Lee's first impulse is always to express cinematically. So the acting is placed within the film rather than the other way around. He worries about textures, textures of the place of course (lipstick on a coffeecup) but textures of time (the shuffling of Mahjong tokens) and emotion. This is what film-making is at the start; using the vocabulary. If we had nothing else at all, we would still have the pleasure of an artist comfortably in his medium.

The second notable thing is a narrative device I study: folding, especially folding associated with new noir. The instance here is that we have an actress playing an actress. She plays on stage and in real life, and naturally the two blend. Artists use this device because there is a subtle but powerful dynamic at work: as we see the fiction and reality converge in the story, we internally blend the fiction on the screen with the reality of our lives. It happens that Lee's cinematic skills are tuned to emphasizing this dynamic. Its a wonderful example and one that works to a clearly noticeable degree. 

He casts this "play" within a situation of Mahjong, where fakes and bluffs are expected. Western viewers like myself will miss the full effect of this, not knowing the scheming in the game that -- in the first few minutes -- we have conflated with how the women we see are the real hidden power behind the men. And then we move into the noir element, the third notable feature.

The hidden power behind the (Chinese) men we see are Japanese occupiers. But diffused through all this is the simple, overwhelming urge to belong -- belong to a country, a movement, a man. Many movies have this feature, and as here conflate the personal conflict with surrounding political ones. Many also show passion and sex. But Lee has found a new way, made available by simply showing things as they really are, not as homogenized to satisfy some cultural need to hide our humanness.

This passion is real enough, what we see is real enough that we see it immediately as something we have all experienced. That puts us in the innermost seed of this narrative at the same time that Lee has us penetrating from the outside by his folding dynamics. 

Simple noir is the situation of an average person being manipulated by forces that are connected to the fact that a viewer is involved. Odd circumstances appear to drive the story that would never happen if there were not the invisible force of the narrative demands of the viewer. This transforms the viewer into an agent of the story. It happens here of course: we are denoted on-screen as members of the theater audience, as watchers (and controllers) of the resistance cell, and finally at the end as the off-screen watchers of the Japanese overlords. (Skilled viewers will note that most of the techniques Lee uses are from the Japanese cinematic vocabulary.)

And then there are the sex scenes. Instead of overtly recognizing the presence of the viewer by carefully posing and framing to hide the reality of the act, we have the opposite: revealing of the moist, rushed details.

This, I think is a must see. Only the score is less than perfect.

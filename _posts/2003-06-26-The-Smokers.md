Spoilers herein.

You already know this is a disaster: an edgy film that is incompetently tepid. It's placed  near "Ginger Snaps" in tone and "Business of Strangers" in plot. But it is so inept it hurts.

But you might want to see it anyway. Sometimes when a very good actor finds herself  under a clueless director, interesting things happen: she makes her own way, filling  spaces that the director is wholly unaware of. Thora Birch is only on the screen a few  moments here, as she was on her way from "Beauty" to "Ghost." But she is incredible.

She does the Jack Nicholson thing, holding a tension like many actors. Holding it  internally, some distance under the skin. So far, pretty ordinary. But once in a while she'll  move that tension to just outside her skin. What makes it Nicholsonian is the way she  does it: sometimes dramatically so we notice and sometimes subtly so that we are put  off. Four girls wear makeup masks. Only she knows how to use that in her craft.

At the end, she is walking into the graduation and turns around and sticks out her  tongue. Compare that to a similar situation: Jack coming into the asylum at the  beginning of "Cuckoo," with the same glance/shift of presence.

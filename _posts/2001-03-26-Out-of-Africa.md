Spoilers herein.

This works. But it works for disturbing reasons.

The film changes her deep respect for things African (except the headman). The whole tone is European: the 'high level' view of the land, even the score. What's strange is that much of the book deals with how alien is the European perspective in Africa. The movie misses that kernel, but for slight lip service. Her things in the house are more European looking than her real possessions (which one can see in Denmark). It could as well have been set in Australia to judge from the film instead of the book.

Streep is a miracle. How sad has her state become since. Here, she is at the height of her powers, from 'French Lieutenant's Woman' to 'Ironweed.' Redford's character is much more interesting than Redford. He merely exudes charm -- his effect doesn't come so much from talent.

Dinesen's stories are indeed wonderful (and Markam's which are also used here).That, and the deep landscapes are what carries this simple movie. This was the first big budget film that was primarily meditative -- especially the last 50 minutes -- with scant plot, so Pollack deserves some credit for breaking the ice for more advanced meditations.

Suzanna Hamilton's and Michael Kitchen's characters are charming. I recently saw Kitchen in 'Proof of Life' which quotes this film. He was rather good there too.

This film should be seen for historical reasons: of colonialism, of a great actress, of a landmark technique.

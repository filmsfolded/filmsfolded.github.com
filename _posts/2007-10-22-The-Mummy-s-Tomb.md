This is the second of the Universal mummy remakes, and I think the worst. 

Mummy still lives. Mummy kills. Mummy burns. Ho hum. 

There's one thing interesting about though. They wanted to reuse as much footage from the earlier film as possible, so perhaps a third of the movie is a retelling of what happened by a participant 30 years later. You see the old footage in flashback. Despite the weaknesses of the movie, this device works for me. Its a crude fold, putting us in the story as the audience of the older story, soon to be visited by the ghoul from that story.

As the template flows in many of these, the pretty girl is desired by the monster, or in this case the monster's controller. Her virginity is established by some mechanics having to do with an impeding marriage. The template usually has her strapped to a bed, awaiting some puncture.

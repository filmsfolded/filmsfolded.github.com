Spoilers herein.

This is very much a TeeVee movie. It has an extraordinary focus on faces, a TeeVee  indicator. And it follows the Rod Serling rules. In a theater, you have a captive audience  so you can dole out the mystery and solution as you go. In TeeVee land you compete for  their attention: nothing can be resolved until the very last minute. You must keep them  wondering through all those commercials.

So we have 95 minutes of preparation for a spooky end.

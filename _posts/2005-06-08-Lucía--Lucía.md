Within the world of film are movies that comment on themselves. This post-postmodern trend is the most rewarding to my tastes, and no one does it better or more creatively than Spanish speaking filmmakers.

So profound is the influence that even an offhand secondrater like this gets seasoned with clever ideas.

The underlying notion here is the story is narrated by a woman whose husband has left her. She is what they call an untrusted narrator: she lies, she embellishes then admits it and backtracks only to replace the old with new lies.

The game is in discovering that this is the case, then unravelling what has really happened. Along the way, you invariably lie to yourself and make up a pleasant movie with a happy ending out of all the possibilities available to you.

Both folding and fictional redhead allow this to overcome serious weaknesses.

I read Christie, study her actually for her inventiveness in playing a game that is central to the future of narrative. It is truly important.

I watch the Suchet adaptations because my wife likes them. But I grit my teeth when I see how brutally they have destroyed what was novel. Oh, I don't mind Suchet, or the bumblingizing of Hastings. They aren't the way Agatha drew them, but they are similarly cartoonish characterizations and she would likely have approved.

No, the problem has been the dreadful writing of that blunt man Exton. They changed production crews from one film to another but nearly all the adaptations were written by that oaf who transformed a challenge into TeeVee fare where we are surprised at the end without work.

At long last, they fired the guy and brought in a writer who's more true to the complexity of the enterprise. This fellow Horowitz did well enough on "Murder on the Links," but here he does a splendid job. Agatha's written clues are converted to cinematic devices. In a TeeVee world where every face much be clearly shown, we have several that are not. Ho ho, something's up. I didn't remember the MacBeth part from the book. I think that was an extra, theatrical, hint.

A community of actors. Yes. And this time they really engage us, even better than in the book because here they are actors playing actors who are in turn deceiving us.

I am appreciative of film and Shakespeare both. The problems of transporting the plays, essentially minimal and cerebral, to moving images are daunting and I appreciate a novel attempt. Even if it fails, it is likely to fail interestingly. Of Shakespeare's plays, the comedies are about situations, the tragedies about ideas. Neither of those translates well to film. But the histories, lesser plays in my opinion, are about characters. Now, character exploration is inherently cinematic, a natural for the screen. especially with as many speeches to the camera, confidences with the audience, this play provides.

So I went into this prepared, nay yearning to like it, even like its failures. I don't mind resetting, cutting and such. My favorite adaptation is Greenaway's 'Prospero's Books,' to give you some idea of the slack I cut.

But this simply doesn't work, either as film or as Shakespeare.

There are interesting, even clever sets most of the time, but they are not used well. The battles, even the minor intrigues don't compel -- we always are distracted by the cheap staginess of it all. Some actors are good enough, some rather dreadful, but none of it works because the troop doesn't have a center. They could, should have relied on Shakespeare. But they didn't. Instead, there is a strange pastiche of camp, satire, earnest emotion. It is as if each actor had their own idea of the nature of the experiment, or joke and failed to tell the others.

Someone, perhaps here, thought that if Shakespeare were alive, this is how he would have done it. Nay. He was first and foremost an actor, a skilled dramatist. He would have concentrated on story, on developing motivations, on conflicts, on duplicity. None of that has any citizenship here. He would never, ever pass off a tank blasting through a wall as a dramatic effect.

All faults would be forgiven if the lead were sufficiently powerful to compel us, perhaps an early Wells. But McKellan just doesn't have the stuff. He can handle the language, such as he kept, but he lacks the projection, the charm Richard commanded.

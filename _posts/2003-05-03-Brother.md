Spoilers herein.

There's no single element here that can't be found better in lots of other places. What makes this - and I presume other Kitano projects - worth watching is the complete integration of all those elements into something pure in its personality. It is not a personality that I find interesting (Like 'Ghost Dog' or any Mifune/Kurosawa project or even Leone), but I do recommend this to cinephiles who appreciate it when a film has a center. Everything in this project knows where that center is and adds to the being built around it. The central character of course has the same personality as the film, something I especially appreciate: meditative tension - no deliberation, only principled reaction.

The female lover is something of note. Any project like this, where the presenter is so omnipresent, must have a token 'viewer' as white space. Joy Nakagawa is a sort of model/celebrity interviewer, a media type more recognizable in Japan. Here, she is tarted up appropriately and the effect of her presence is subtle (as most everything here). Her demise is a dual of the similar hostage situation of Aniki, where Denny shoots, does some damage but saves the day. Her death and the fated spiral downward must follow, and with just the same symmetry.

Sometimes the sheer audacity of a project is enough by itself to make it worthwhile. Often when that's the case, the ambition of the project outstrips the filmmaker's abilities, but we subconsciously fill in the inadequacies and enjoy the show.

In this case, we have incredibly rich possibilities and some previously clever and successful writers, at least when working on the "short form," where one big and two small jokes will suffice. That big joke with these guys is usually shaped as postmodern satire where an uncomfortable corner of life is trotted out and exposed as, well... uncomfortable.

These guys are best when the possibilities of the joke aren't exhausted because of a need to fill time, when the situation (and perspective) involves innocent kids, and the animation is highly abstract. That applies in "South Park," but not here.

The possibilities are cool and uniquely suited to movies:

America at present is almost completely a nation which defines itself in movie terms; the level of the national narrative is now set by guys like Bruckheimer. America, all its "religious" values, all its myths and identity have been coopted by one party, possibly for an entire generation. Major life and death decisions are made on this basis.

Meanwhile, the people in the actual business of movies (and that includes most "news" reporters) are shouting the insight that is obvious to them; those guys are exploiting you using techniques we understand. Unfortunately, they spin a similarly cinematic and simpleminded narrative of greed and payoffs, not having the intellectual power or desire to elevate us.

Puppets all around.

This is the territory into which these boys have ventured, using a movie to expose the movie- ness of both sides. They believe that by simply showing excess, the first resort of satirists, all will be manifestly clear. The problem is that the technique of showing excess they chose is excessive itself in precisely the same manner. So they can stir the pot, but end up stirring themselves as well.

The juvenile humor in other projects hasn't been anything other than an irreverent tone- setter. Here, a homophobic streak is inserted in such a way that it never turns back on itself to let us know it was only another Styrofoam pillar kicked down.

Ask yourself why "Blame Canada" was a milestone in satiric humor in the South Park movie. Recall the way that unravels your political mind without fingerpaints. Then look for something as rich here.

Nope.

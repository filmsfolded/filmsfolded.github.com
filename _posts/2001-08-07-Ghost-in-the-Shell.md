Spoilers herein.

This story is just plain stupid. And I say this as someone steeped in SciFi, and especially investigations of created consciousness.

There are some wonderful books to check out, depending on your taste. What makes these worthwhile is the deep ambiguity, from Golem through Frankenstein to P. K. Dicke.

I suppose since these movies are for kids, they can't be any more sophisticated than Saturday morning cartoons. There are some haunting visuals here, but they have nothing to do with the story. Good science fiction creates a new world, extrapolated from now. What's extrapolated here are some corporate strengths and robotics. Same stupid guns, keyboards. text-based computer screens! Ordinary guns. An ordinary conspiracy.

What's strange is that the robots are humanoid, girls with huge breasts and no genitals. What's the excuse?

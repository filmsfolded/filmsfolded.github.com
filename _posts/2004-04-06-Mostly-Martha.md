Spoilers herein.

This is a German movie, which is to say that it is mechanical. But it is an intelligent  German movie, so one can expect it to be introspective and reflexive. And so it is.

It starts out with very crisp, engineered shots and editing; incidentally, our heroine is  crisp, mechanical and engineered. Moreover, so is her creation: three levels.

As it progresses through the old (dare I say mechanical?) plot device of 'unprepared adult  unexpectedly inherits sweet kid,' it becomes more emotional and Italian. As it does, the  photography and editing mutates to the characteristic, veristic languor of Italian films.  And the food mutates as well. 

Three levels.

As food films go, this is one of the best, though perhaps not as engaging as others.  'Cook, Thief...' is perhaps the most cinematic and sensual, 'Eat, Drink..' the most  flavorful. But this is the most integrated in its matter and manner.

Others: 'Babbette's Feast,' 'Big Night,' 'Wedding Feast,' 'Tortilla Soup' (bad), 'What's  Cooking' (bad)...

Redheads again are featured, including brown and blond hair lit to be red, and this helps  a lot.

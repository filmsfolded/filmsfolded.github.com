Spoilers herein.

This is a simple story about a storyteller and his stories. So it fits the standard play within the play format. 

I suppose you can judge for yourself how bad this is, and how offensive. What interests me is Ted's law of insertion: that's where the story within (the cartoon B'rer stories) is exactly the same distance of abstraction as the containing story (the tripe about the kid, his dad and frequently mistaken mother) is from the world of the viewer.

Spoilers herein.

I can enjoy almost any movie, and pride myself on being able to see something  interesting in even the worst, like "Video Dead." But this type of black exploitation film is  too great a challenge. Yes, it was funny in spots, but it was the kind of humor that  debases the laugher. Yes, it is great to laugh at ourselves and there's some latitude when  the performers are of the same group as the target. 

Ostensibly, this is a Black "Clerks." But I feel like a smaller person after an experience like  this. That shouldn't be.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of  your life.

This is an odd film, worth studying. It is the strangest kind of documentary, a dramatization of what might happen instead of a report on what has. And although it was scary enough to be buried for two decades, it actually understates the disruption a war would have caused.

And still could. In fact, this little film could be called an awareness exercise to prompt readiness. Since most analysts consider an Islamic terrorist bomb against a western city a near certainty, perhaps we need a modern version of this.

It is a collection of extrapolations based on past wars and placed in Britain should the Russians choose to attack. Some scary facts about NATO's announced "first use" policy are given: If any invasion occurred, NATO would use tactical nukes to offset Russian numerical superiority. Knowing this (and the fact that their missiles are vulnerable liquid-fueled models) the Russians are likely to preempt over any scenario likely to lead to war.

The damage from the actual attack is muted, instead focusing on the confusion afterwards for the unhappy survivors. I suppose the torture of the living is scarier business, at least in film. So we have lots of begrimed but healthy looking actors talking about their various miseries.

Funny, I thought this valuable propaganda, where its sibling "Threads" was simple religious posturing. I'm sure some will disagree, but look at the intent. This one clearly intends to scare the bejeesus out of Brits so that at least they might prepare a bit. "Threads" simply exploits the possibility to present a drama.

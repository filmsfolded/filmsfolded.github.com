Spoilers herein.

This little disaster probably resulted from 9-11. I get the impression that the project was  halted halfway through and was just shoved out in this form.

No great loss. But it does have two interesting elements.

The first is Lena Olin. I think she is one of the most interesting woman in film. Some  talent, deep training, cinematic poise. I appreciate actors who understand levels. She  does, but doesn't quite have the chops to pull them off, so you can see in her eyes the  intent. It is an exotic seduction.

The second is this director who seems to be on the "artistic" edge of TeeVee production.  He does a lot of adventurous things with the camera for no apparent reason, but then  sometimes it clicks. For instance, the opening sequence is pretty thrilling in a Karwai  manner: all black and white except for red architectural elements. No angle natural, no  perspective right angled, no movement of humans in any way related to the position of  the camera. Again, the same thing when one witness is caught and killed by the mean  old Army guys.

I get the impression that this could have been worth watching for these two elements of  style if the project had been funded enough for someone to wrestle this director's  impulses into shape.

The worldview that drives this movie is the notion that you cannot escape the stories of the past. Ruiz makes movies with this point, especially one I saw recently, "Geneologies." In this view, the teller doesn't capture a story, it is the other way around. There are only so many stories, and when one captures you, it will engulf you, only to be possibly bested by a stronger one.

That's the story within this little movie, done well enough for TeeVee, I suppose. But it is also the story about why this and all Czech cinema is so defeatist. Yes, I know the Czech republic is a tiny nation, so we shouldn't expect much. But compared say, to New Zealand, the contrast in imagination is striking. Sure, they were bludgeoned by successively thuggish occupiers, but look at Polish cinema. Some are truly lyrical and life-altering things, no? What's happened with this movie: it has been captured by the larger Czech arc of defeat. That larger arc drives this and completely overtakes the best efforts of Svankmeir, who in a few earlier projects really seemed to have some promise as a visual artist if not a long form storyteller.

The movie's story, since you likely won't see it, is of a couple who out of emotional need take a piece of yard waste as an infant, and he grows too big for his situation, eating everything he encounters. Meanwhile, a little girl in the same building follows that larger story by reading the "original" in a children's book. So she knows the score, and how it will end.

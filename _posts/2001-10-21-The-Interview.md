Spoilers herein.

This is worth seeing for the stylish direction and very fine acting. But I found the story unsatisfying, and that's problematic because the 'heavy' story is the whole motivation for making it. Needed more ambiguity to suit my taste. Also didn't like the slow revealing of information because there were no red herrings, nothing you learn that you have to unlearn. The director called it a peeling of the onion, a metaphor that disallows false leads, misdirection. This makes it completely, utterly different than 'Usual Suspects' or 'Fight Club,' or even 'Sixth Sense,' where every scene has to be retrospectively reinvented.

What happens is not ambiguous at all, there's just a switch of presumptions from innocent to guilty. There IS a good sense of dueling, but it is only a sense: there is no real deep chess. The captive wins by luck, not cleverness.

The thing that really bothered me was the lost opportunity to play with the truth as said, as remembered, as constructed by different minds. This is what film is all about, this slipperiness. The script could have exploited the fact that this is a story about a story; and independently a film about a film; and yet more -- a (police) report about a (news) report. But all these opportunities are wasted, so instead of a real mindbender, we get to view a master acting class, nothing else. Nothing in the class of, say 'Memento.'

But it is worth seeing, comparatively, and gets this director on my watch list.

Did I recognize in the solicitor the widow Malcolm who was so memorable in 'Oscar and Lucinda?' (She raped a semi-comatose R. Fiennes?) Looks like a young Joely Richardson.

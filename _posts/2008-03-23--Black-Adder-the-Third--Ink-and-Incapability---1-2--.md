I've been hearing about this TeeVee series for years and finally watched an episode.

Its probably not a fair assessment because the gimmick depends on accretive jokes. But I was fairly impressed.

The reason is that the basis for the story and many of the jokes depends on a literary awareness. Its a bit of a pleasure. No, the jokes weren't any better in formation than what you usually see. But there's something deep and lasting in literate humor, even silly puns. I wonder why this is so rare, even in films.

This is superimposed on relationship situations. Most sitcoms are, but because this is intelligently British, its not based on friends and lovers, but on class. Even for this non- Brit, that element goes deeper.

If I were going to mess with TeeVee shows, this would be near the top of the list.

Spoilers herein.

Sometimes a film strikes me the way it was intended: as a simple message divorced from  all the mechanics associated with its context, creation and delivery. In this case,  though by (supposedly) an artist it is without artifice or irony, both of which would  become common in a few years.

In this case, we have just the sort of thing that government anticommunist crusaders  would later campaign against: inherent goodness in labor, persistent optimism in the  land, a good woman. It would be appealing if it weren't so honest. Simplicity of this type  persists in religious right republicanism (in the US), a massive irony. Politics as religion  as simple film truths.

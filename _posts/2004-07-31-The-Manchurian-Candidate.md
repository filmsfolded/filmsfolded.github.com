Spoilers herein.

Yes of course this is partisan, but then not as much so as 'Red, White and Blond' which  celebrates and helps invent the 'patriotism' of the dumb but well intentioned. Yes, we have a  feckless president, a vice president controlled by corporations, wars fought for the benefit of  investors. Not even interesting because it isn't fantastic.

Of slightly more interest is what is kept and what tossed. The incest is kept, and the memory  of his first sex as what foils the brainwashing. In the original, a few men were brainwashed;  here we all are. Then, something akin to psychoanalytic magic was responsible for the effect  while here it is mere chippery of the Stepford variety.

The most important feature of the original was an essay - one of a long line - about the  nature of film. Like many intelligent and effective films, it was essentially about itself. The  notion of the medium as a tool for conveying a reality to our minds is not so far from  implanting. There was a shocking (for the time) cinematic overlay of a banal, 'American'  gathering as a mask of the brainwashing. As the film progresses, the 'reality' bleeds through  in the image precisely as the fiction of the film's story is clarified in our minds. Brainwashing  revealed while it happens!

Demme is decidedly less intelligent. There is no such cinematic self-reference. What we have  instead is a lot of heavy overt reference to TeeVee as propaganda, but that is far from the  mark of the more profound original notion. Actually, I suppose it is less Demme's ignorance  than Washington's. After all, Demme _has_ done the overlain contradictory self-reference  thing.

'Philadelphia' used loathing stereotypes to indicate compassion; 'Silence' shifted the pursuit  of the deranged to the deranged side; 'Stop Making Sense' made sense precisely where it  claimed otherwise. With 'Swimming.' he coinvented the palatable non-movie about movies  (turning 'My Dinner with Andre' inside out). So we know Demme has - or had - the chops  for what this could have been.

But this was shaped and pushed by Denzel, who is admired for his obvious intensity in place  of true acting. The man probably never understood what the first 'Candidate' was about. We  need actors, but it is a shame when we give them enough control to just give us a movie  filled with acting and no ideas, no soul.

Kimberly Elise's face is at least deeply photographed among the many less effective closeups.

Spoilers herein.

Gadzooks, another movie about movies. The first time around, the story was simple: Disney  had invented the medium of animated features but had lost their moxie. Then, under the oaf  Eisner Disney made a deal with Pixar (which had been cast off by George Lucas and revived  by Steve Jobs), and all of a sudden had completely dominated the genre.

Eisner rival Katzenberg resolves to best Eisner, after all he just doesn't deserve it. You should  also know that the first battle was long before. When Pixar was preparing 'Bugs,' Katzenberg  rushed together 'Ants' to open earlier just to steal their thunder.

So then Katzenberg makes 'Shrek' with a farting character and story intended to spoof the  Disney model. And it is set in Hollywood and features a dwarfish 'king' modeled after Eisner.

Now along comes the sequel. Again, we poke fun at Eisner who is revealed to be a frog.  Incidentally, Disney just picked up rights to the last Henson character: Kermit. The model for  the story this time is 'The Muppet Movie' which is about the making of itself by coming to  that far far away place, Hollywood, and dealing with the fact of who you are.

Along the way, it would be good for you to know that Disney has the world's most advanced  character lab, a place that invented the Irish redheaded female character that is portrayed  here, as well as the whole notion of animated fairy godmothers. (And did you notice the  imprisoned Tinkerbells who can't stand the stink?)

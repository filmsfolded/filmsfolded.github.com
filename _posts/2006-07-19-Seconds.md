There are few things more interesting than a good movie that doesn't work. By "good" here, I mean projects where all the participants know their craft and the thing has some sort of coherence and sense, "Doesn't work" is a fuzzier notion and possibly in this case has to do with personal preferences and vulnerabilities.

First the personal. Frankenheimer shares one of my interests, techniques for merging dramatic conveyance with how the eye reaches. He's unafraid to experiment with angles, lenses, placement. This is a special interest of mine.

He comes at it first by looking at the immediate drama the way an actor would. This means that he doesn't think of the whole project only specific scenes. It also means that he is interested in getting the "message" across. The result is that he thinks in unsophisticated ways. For example, he'll want to convey that the lead character at the beginning is troubled and alone. 

A different director may trust the actor to do what actors do and then surround and support him with things that only a director can do, worrying about all the tendrils between the viewer and the actor. But this guy decides to get in the vehicle of the actor, so all the camera tricks are designed as enhancements of actorly devices.

Aronofsky does this today, with somewhat better effect, but that's largely because he had material that was written with this in mind. Frankenheimer didn't and doesn't seem to know the difference.

So when you view this, you'll see only half a movie.

That half is worthwhile in its own way quite apart from the wasted work with the eye. This uses lots of blacklisted actors. It -- for its time -- was relatively bold in the use of nudity and an implied orgy. 

It has an interesting story: a man is not who he appears to be and he himself is in a situation that is not what it appears. There are two Rod Serling-inspired twists in this latter deception.

You might find this rewarding if you believe that movies are centered on acting more or less exclusively. I don't; I think the art of film has so many other elements that have been overlooked here, so watching this makes me shake my head over the missed opportunities.

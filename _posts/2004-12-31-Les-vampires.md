I suppose it behooves us to know the history of cinema. Its not that long and some of this early stuff had unintended and possibly outrageous influence.

The situation was that in the ten years prior there were all sorts of possibilities for film. It could have been an extension of painting, of dance, of photography (which then had a strong artistic tradition). But "birth of a nation" terminated all futures (at least until recently) and froze film as an extension of theater. That's a crying shame.

This series is one of many varieties of drama that followed that final freezing. The template comes from magazine serials, still influenced by the Conan Doyle influence of the Holmes stories. There had to be secret cabals of thieves with extraordinary, inscrutable powers. There had to be a detective, in this early incarnation still a reporter. There had to be incredible devices and poisons and tricks. Shady getaways and hair-raising escapes.

But those magazine series were drek, and so is this. But stuck it has, and the episodic adventures of TeeVee detectives -- especially those of the sixties -- followed the pattern. In fact, the pattern even extended to vast periods of time just watching people walk, climb (we have to see the whole thing) and run. In modern times, this extended to the convenient TeeVee filler of watching the detectives walk to their car, get in, start up and drive away. We have to see the entire thing. 

There's no art here, no innovation in framing, tone... any element. Just a history lesson in how the banal became acceptable.

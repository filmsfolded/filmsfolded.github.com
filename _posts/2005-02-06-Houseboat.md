I've commented on about 2000 films. I can find something interesting in just about any film, the worse the better. But this is not just a bad movie, it is offensive.

I'm not just talking about what would suggest sexual abuse in today's context. Every element is the worst of the Hollywood formula system: 

-- the way that one of the world's most glamorous women is made up and photographed as actually ugly.

-- the vapid appeal to "Saturday Post" notions of religion, something that would offend even a Texas fundamentalist.

-- the completely valueless and nonsensical dynamics of the romantic situation on both sides: the sister-in-law cum lover then dumped and the presumably hotblooded impetuous runaway daughter cum maid then second wife.

-- the blatant theft of the Buster Keaton bit about the train hitting the house, except all we see are some Styrofoam boards thrown toward Grant.

-- the promising setup of the houseboat that is utterly ignored.

-- the bankable humor of Grant that seems to have been deliberately avoided at every opportunity. Add to this the other characters, so poorly drawn they don't even qualify as cartoons.

-- the Edith Head costumes that are unflattering, uninteresting _and_ unphotogenic.

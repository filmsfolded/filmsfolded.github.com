Spoilers herein.

The basics: Penn is the next Woody Allen, but more adept and more visceral. His own understanding of acting attracts some top flight talent, and here they are all as good as it gets. Even Micky Rourke is powerful! Nicholson starts a new career. Making a film is all about abstraction, and since it is a collective art, managing all the abstractions so that a single vision projects. The odder the vision, the more worthwhile, and the harder to corral. This man ruthlessly exploits everything that streams at us (including the music -- so apt). 

Del Toro is worth mentioning because he is currently in two other films of merit. But the cinematic flash there is all in support of either nothing (Snatch) or thin narrative support for a relatively vapid insight (Traffic). Here, not only is Del Toro amazingly real, but the whole film delivers powerful dramatic effect integrated with narrative, unlike the other two which are mostly dance.

The IMDB comments posted before this are largely negative, and I speculate these are from younger folk -- further that the audience Pledge grabs in the gut will be among more experienced souls. The ending is great, the biggest emotional cliff since 'Limbo.'

But all that is just surface stuff -- a man pledging his soul and losing it when the bargain is usatisfiable. The really interesting thing is the ambiguity of the narrative. We know Penn is concerned with this issue -- really hot among thinking directors for the past couple years. Here he (and the original book) play Nabokov -- the pacing of the film resembles a madman's reminiscences. Yes, there are too many coincidences in the story. Yes it is framed by a mad drunk's mumblings. Yes, the camera deliberately takes non-contemporary human viewer perspectives. Yes, there are discontinuities. Yes, the 'Lolita' references were many and obvious.

What we have here folks is a multilayered weaving of reality and imagination. We saw Penn act at these two levels simultaneously in Woody's 'Sweet and Lowdown.' Now he coaches buddy Jack (who has more to give and more to lose) into a more nuanced dual-level performance. This will endure when 'Snatch' is long gone.

This is the first 10 I give in 12 months of theater releases. That's about 100 films.

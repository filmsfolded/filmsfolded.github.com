Spoilers herein.

I like films that are explicitly about filmmaking, and so much the better if they are about the making of themselves. We've had films before ('13th Floor' comes to mind) where the participants in the film-within were unwitting. This treatment is very clever. Naturally it involves the self-referential devices, but it also wraps them in self-referential incidentals: the bit about alien invaders, the whole thing about the cult, even the wistful desire to get a (Fedex) message.

Along the way we get some more common conventions: the twin (here the brother) and the actors-as-whores routine.

Of Eddie Murphy's roles, this is probably the one that best shows his remarkable talent.

Spoilers herein.

This has no soul. But you knew that already. What's interesting is how the machine emulates film. 

Movies and books take us to different times and places at will, but we cannot change what is written. The world is divided into writers (Morlocs) and readers. The writers are in control -- they maintain us merely as food for their appetites. The war depicted in the book (and more briefly here) is a war of readers to wrest control. Unless we do, the future looks bleak.

This was Welles' genius. The irony of this film is that some milchtoast bozo in Hollywood has acted on our behalf as revolutionary by proxy and has betrayed the very idea behind the story.

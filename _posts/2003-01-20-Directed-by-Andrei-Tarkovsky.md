Spoilers herein.

This small documentary can be found on the Kino DVD of 'The Sacrifice.'

It is striking in how incompetent it is, compared to the film it documents, but I found it valuable nonetheless. 

That is because it documents Tarkovsky's capture by the forces of reason and logic, which is what threw 'The Sacrifice' off kilter.

It does display a genius, but one who has wriggled his mind into some distance from his time of genius.

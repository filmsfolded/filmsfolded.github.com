Spoilers herein.

This is an unremarkable film that prompts a remarkable question. What role does reality play in film? The reason for this film to exist is that it shows us 'real' sex where most would just simulate it. But the violence is fake, and so are the emotions, both excessively so as if in poor films there is a law that conserves fakery. Would it be a more powerful film if the actors agreed to be actually killed?

In general, I'm in favor of fearlessness. Greenaway is my most admired filmmaker. But the art comes first, doesn't it? And then whatever is required, fulfilled to the commitment and ability of the artist. Art where the display of commitment comes first isn't really worth it. Not in my book. It's just religion.

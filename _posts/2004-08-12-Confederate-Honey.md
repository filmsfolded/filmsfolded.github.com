Spoilers herein.

Many of the cartoons from this era were built around making fun of specific popular items:  books, movies and such. The whole idea was to show everything in the most ridiculous light.

Some of these, like this one (and scores of others) tread on matters of race. Either they deal  with WWII Asians, or Blacks of some ilk. They are all now in 'collections of shame' in various  institutions, and deemed unsuitable for viewing. Racist.

In the States, racism is the big taboo, so these are considered too offensive to watch because  of the role of blacks, their minstrel-like appearance and the resulting stereotypical behavior.  Never mind that in many cases the non-Blacks are portrayed in much the same way -  ostensibly because as oppressors a spoof of themselves cannot be oppressive.

This particular instance makes fun of a film (then fresh) rather than society at large and is in  a special category, which to my mind puts it on the acceptable side of that great dividing  line. Its the film that's racist, this most popular film in history. Pointing that out humorously  seems to me in the best tradition of the Waylons, and that's a good thing.

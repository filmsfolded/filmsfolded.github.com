Sometimes simple works.

These things are usually pretty formulaic. Individual or couple goes to the wild of some sort and is redeemed. This way we get to see some expression in the world: war or sickness to illustrate what we normally would have to rely on actors alone to provide. Inner turmoil or distance, or in this case, the ennui of emotional distance.

And when it is set in China, we have a double whammy because this is a model of first resort for the Chinese themselves. In the west, I believe "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness" was the first of these. Or even "Black Narcissus."

I don't know this director, but he had me at the first sequence, one of the most effective beginnings I know. A sparse, angry man and his wife have just been dropped off in the middle of the wild in China. They arrange themselves in a very careful triad with us, what each of us is staring at is significant, and the motions of each of us as we relax out of the pose tells us all we need to know to enter that world. Its magnificent.

That flash of luxury gives us a sense of what Naomi Watts' character experiences in her brief affair with a man in control. Its subtle, powerful, simple and effective. The downside of this for is the original story, which is blunt and stupid. We've got the grizzled provincial totem with his beautiful concubine and drugs. We've got an even more stereotypical Franch nuns and her cherubic orphans.

And we've got Norton's character. He does it well enough, and it is his most restrained role, I think. But the character was written as a cartoon.

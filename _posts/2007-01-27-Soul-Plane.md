I'm stuck in a series of bad movies, movies based on stupid philosophies. 

Race movies can find different pockets of acceptance. It depends on where you are I suppose. This is a typical one of the new minstrelism. The idea is to make blacks look as ridiculous as possible, and we are supposed to laugh now because these modern stepinfetchits do it to themselves for pay.

It can be fun when the irony is ladled on heavily. The Wayons do this for me. Eddie Murphy in "Bowfinger."

But not here. This steps back.

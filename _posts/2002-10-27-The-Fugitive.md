Spoilers herein.

This is as close as you can get to take advantage of the limited things Jones and Ford can do.

Massive stunts at the beginning. Jones struts, Ford scowls and staggers. Then you can settle in for the chase, minor plot twist and obligatory confrontation. But even though this as slick as you can get with this crew, I am amazed at how poorly it has aged. Part of it is the obsolescence of any thriller -- the latest stuff always eclipses the old. But the mechanics of this seem so transparent now. A US marshall with such resources, freedom and personality -- and someone who really would care a hoot about innocence. A specialist physician with any sense of cleverness. The old noodle of the scheming, murderous megacorporation who can manipulate a few facts to advantage.

The many, many confrontations among these magnetic characters. The clean resolution of justice at the end. Too much. Too much.

I picked it up because I am reviewing Julianne Moore's work. She is in only one small episode, something engineered to convince us of the thorough decency of the doctor. I haven't seen all of her work -- much is difficult to access. But this ranks with 'Evolution' as her worst. Both the project as a whole, and her contribution are curdled.

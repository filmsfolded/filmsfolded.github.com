Spoilers herein.

Woody is sometimes a challenge. He makes films for himself and sometimes leaves us out of it altogether. Sometimes he is cleverly sublime ('Sweet and Lowdown') and sometimes stupid ('Crimes and Misdemeanors,' 'Small Time Crooks'). Here he does well. Actually, with this film, he enters that exclusive club of folks who know how to arrange the eye's field.

The film is based on Fellini's 'Juliet of the Spirits.' In that film, Fellini writes about his wife and her struggle with wealth and ideals mediated by supernatural forces. His wife stars. To this, Woody adds some 'Alice in Wonderland' elements on a superficial level: she takes substances and changes consciousness. He folds some of these into his tricksterisms on film narrative:

She wants to be a film (actually TeeVee) writer; We attend a writing class on the uniqueness of film narrative. By fits, we have hypnotic visions; are visited by the dead; become invisible (characters become viewers); have opium visions where she views her past Dickens-style; are visited by a 'muse;' and become captured by a film (of Mother Theresa). This is all pretty intelligent and self-reflexive stuff.

The most amazing scene is the visit to the circus, carefully copied from a Seurat painting. Probably his best painting (there were only a few) and the one most chocked with fractal echos of itself.

Mia does here what Kenneth Branagh and Ed Norton were to do later in Allen films: act the part as Woody, with the inflections and bodily movements.

The engineering of the hair color interests me. Mia's is given a very tame reddish-blondness. Her young self is played by Rachel Minor, also a strawberry, and her mother (Gwen Verdon) is red. The adulterer's wife (Judy Davis) is also red.

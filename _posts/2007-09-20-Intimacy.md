Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I mean real drama. I mean the kind that is designed to turn you inside out rather than merely distract you from anything real. I think this is real. Its clearly meant to matter and designed so. Everyone involved is committed. The actors slightly cross that line about showing sex and therefore let us know that we are meant to take this as real, as intended. And we do.

I'm sure it works for some viewers. It didn't for me, and I think the reason is simple. I'm not British. 

There are three main characters here, involved in a triangle, the tentativeness and purpose of which forms the spine of the story. But they are surrounded by others. Men with men and women with women. These characters I think are meant to define a sort of broken world, a sort of disordering set of forces in which our three are situated. So they are quirky, exaggerated, and because I'm seeing traits that I only see in other British films, they seem to be templates and therefore unreal. They seem to be from a store, that same store where you get eccentric secondary characters for romantic comedies, or that Bristish twist, the self- absorbed "Trainspotting" genre.

This ruins the whole effect for me, because they may be real people, but they live in an unreal world, so the story doesn't matter.

But there is one thing about this that is remarkable. Its the construction of the narrative.

Remember that the whole thing depends on us getting the message that these actors are committed to being real? Our focus character is a woman who is an actress, trying to be real. More, as she in the movie is intent on showing us how to be real, she plays a character who is not only an actress with similar aspirations. But she has a job showing other less "talented" actors how to do the same. Its a really cool narrative fold. The problem with folds is that they are usually outside the narrative, a sort of metanarrative that declares the movie is fake. But you cannot really get much away without folding these days. 

So this writer has folded directly and openly within the story in a way devised to move the metanarrative away from outside the film to coming from within. Its a character folding, not an actor.

Even though this did not work for me, it might for you. And this very clever engineering of narrative makes it worth watching.

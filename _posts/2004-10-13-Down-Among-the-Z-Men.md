Spoilers herein.

We owe a lot to the Goons. They took the Jarrey notions of absurdism and twisted them into a newly invented humor that we would come to know - through Monty Python - as zany British humor.

One of the Goons - Peter Sellers - would go on to help revolutionize film in more than a couple radical films.

But there's none of that here. In fact, this is only of interest in watching how far they miscalculated. I'm relatively sure that they thought what satisfied TeeVee audiences of the day would be okay if padded with a few songs and dances.

Nope, not even close.

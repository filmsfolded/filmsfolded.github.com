Spoilers herein.

I don't know the genre well. I imagine that there are some really fine films in this family tree  because this one has some great visual moments that are clearly borrowed: lots of business  about toys, teacher/student relationships, loves,  very pure play scholarship. 

It's a pure type: with essentially no background characters. Makes me want to see the real  thing. This one is haunted by what went before.

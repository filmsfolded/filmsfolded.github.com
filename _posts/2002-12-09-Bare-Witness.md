Spoilers herein.

Naturally, you already know this is worthless.

The story is a simple shuffle of the 'implicating tape' hassle -- its amazing how often this happens (this time with the killer's name scrawled in blood). There's other self-reference: Angie as a former 'actress' that couldn't hack it. A fat slob that's her 'producer' who is just like Baldwin only moreso. Her character's aversion to making sex films, precisely the opposite of the actor's.

I've slogged through a few of Angie's projects, and its interesting to see her work. Her job has nothing to do with the character, but to make herself look appealing. Any actress knows that film beauty is a manufactured product. Most work with a single facial feature and build a whole person around it. Angie acts with her hair. See how she arranges to have it lit according to the Hepburn formula. She has very little to work with actually.

There's a very minor role here by someone named Nellie Sciutto. She's a secretary and she actually tries to act. Makes everyone else look bad.

Ted's Evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

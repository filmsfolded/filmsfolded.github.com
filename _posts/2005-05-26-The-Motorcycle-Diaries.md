You'll find this movie enjoyable when you watch it. But afterward you may feel that something is fundamentally out of place.

There are lots of movies whose being is congruent with the message they contain. For instance "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is about some kids developing a ragged style and it itself is an expression of that style.

But there are also many films where the polarity is reversed. The most numerous examples are the many teen films that preach being unique but themselves are bluntly, blindly formulaic.

Well here I think we have an example of the latter. Che's life is probably undiscoverable at this point, but the legend has his notions as deeply rooted in the indigenous. The soul of a place resides in its people, and only by bubbling up larger notions from this root can we get at truth. Latin America, despite Spain's shameless rape, is a special case with deeper indigenous flows, and -- he believes -- a group soul.

Anything in the way of this is evil, including western narratives of capitalism and catholicism. And now we need to add the cloying, falsely ennobling romanticism that is imposed on native people by post-imperialist do-gooders like Robert Redford. 

He sponsors a myth here worthy of Baden-Powell, the guy behind the noble Indian. Everything is beautiful. Every real person is deep and worthwhile. Every action by our hero is exemplary.

Well, okay, such extremes have been with us long before movies. But one must ask why watch such a movie? To be inspired? To be educated? To be entertained? To be ennobled? If any of these four is what you intend, you may want to avoid this new insult on Latin America from the West.

Spanish speaking filmmakers, even in the US, are making the most interesting and genuine films in the world now. This is just a perturbation. Ignore it.

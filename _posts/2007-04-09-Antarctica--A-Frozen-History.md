Antarctica is inherently cinematic, so any film that stars it has an edge. This does. Its amazingly bad as documentary, dry, linear as if its a high school textbook from the sixties. Normally, I'd be warning you away from it. But it incorporates some footage and stills from the actual events, and they are so precious you will cry when you see them. 

That's because they are REAL documentary film-making, made by men who suffered the same challenges they are depicting. Marvelous, genuine. Unfortunately, these real things are interspersed with modern "recreations," as if we need the filler to make a story. Sometimes the difference is obvious, but about half the time it isn't. 

The original stuff, though. The best is by Frank Hayes, the man on the third Shackleton expedition. He was stranded for two years, facing death most days. Genuine, real. It'll cow you unless you are as committed to life as the men you see.

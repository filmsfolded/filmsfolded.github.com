Spoilers herein.

Making a horror film has to be the hardest thing these days. Films are always about the films that went before and nowhere is that more true than in this genre. There are some novel approaches which play with this reference: 'Blair Witch,' and 'The Ring.' But here, a particularly intelligent thing is done, and done well. Many fans of the genre know the TeeVee 'tales of the Crypt' series. That is a particularly junky enterprise. And because it is contained in TeeVee, it can only set up one idea and to set it up without delay. Its very much in the mold of the 'Twilight Zone.'

So this film can refer to that, but have the time and cinematic latitude to exploit the reference. So they start with 'Night of the Living Dead,' and lard it up with a fairly complex story about Jesus' blood and a cosmology of dark forces. In the normal context, this would be just another stupid project. But this is a 'Tales' project, which means we go in expecting the simple setup and a predictable twist. And because we get a real movie, and because that movie is aware of making fun at the TeeVee show, and because it elaborates on 'Night' so expertly, and because it has one good actor, we get thrilled.

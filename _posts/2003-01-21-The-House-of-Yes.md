Spoilers herein.

The first obligation of a film is to register us in whatever world they create. The more interesting confabulations are harder for us to place ourselves in, so much of clever filmwriting is concerned with the tunnels from here to there.

This is nearly a perfect solution, not only in getting us into a very unusual situation, but also in sustaining the reality of that situation. In the end, the entire journey is breathtakingly worthwhile.

Possibly you have to be of a certain age for this to work as well as it did for me: to have burned in your subconscious the iconography that is exploited here.

But what clever risk! We as viewers create fictitious images based on what the characters present; and in reflexive acknowledgement those characters are doing the same thing. Any viewing of a film is at root an obsessive act. Any relationship to screen characters is a matter of intercourse with a demented sibling. Any casting off of that obsession ends up with the corpse of a virtual spouse buried somewhere.

All the collaborators are in the same groove, with the same style of acting, and the same delicate balance of comic distance.

This is superb film theater.

Spoilers herein.

Films have the same mystery as love: you find the best experiences in the most unlikely  places.

This movie gives the impression of a Bull Murray stupidity: teenagers and sex along the  lines of 'Breakfast Club.' Its underscored by using C and D list actors. That's too bad,  because this can be seen as fairly intelligent. 

Daniel Waters writes films that seem to saturate their home genre, yet transcend them in  ways more subtle than parody or the faddish irony. His stance is pretty abstract. 

Take another look at 'Hudson Hawk,' where he explores the very coherence of

representation and cosmology from the twinkle in Willis' eye. Look at 'Batman Returns,'  the one where Tim Burton decided to do it right and intelligently.

Now look at this in the context of the book, 'Lolita.' That wasn't the first book that was  about writing and untrusted narrative. It wasn't the first one where you were fooled into  thinking about the story as a distraction while the author plays with how you perceive it.  But it was the first one that really worked at a level of subliminal metanarrative.

In that story, Humbert imagines that Dolores was engaged in wild sex as a 12 year old at  camp. He removes her from camp to begin his own reality-bending obsession. His  notion of child-sex is purified, innocent.

Now look what we have here: a film about sex at a preteen camp, starring the same girl  who recently played Lolita (Dolores), with a single obsessed adult, and lots of  exploration of an abstract sort of sex.

Very risky approach; very few will get it. But check out the name: Camp Weeping Dove.  Check out the names, Wendy ('Peter Pan'), Pixel (and her crowns), and Oberon

('Midsummer Night's Dream'). Jasper and Talia have several classical associations. Check  out the oddly out of place secondary stories about child abuse (Witchita, and 'don't  touch me'). Did you get the items mentioned in the scavenger hunt?

Dominique Swain puzzles me. She does many of these quirky indies like Parker Posey.  But no one knows they are clever.

Here, she works her butt off, with an energy that shows that there must be a

breakthrough project somewhere in her future,

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 3 - Worth Watching.

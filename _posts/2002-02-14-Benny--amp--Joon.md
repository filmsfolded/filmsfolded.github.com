Spoilers herein.

Yet another film implicitly about film, again through the device of characters who live partly in a fantasy world.

You have the character that lives partly in the film world of the silent greats who finds his place in a video store. The supposition is that he will become an actor.

As with the 'before' actor, you have the 'after' actor, here someone who was in a movie, but returned to real life in Spokane. Just so we don't miss the dual personality theme, the movie she is in features Julianne as two sisters.

That's the 'before and after' characters. In the middle -- presumably in the summer of discovery, we have Joon. Predictably, she is schizophrenic, and someone who works in image. One assumes her straddling of realities makes her a better painter.

This structural conception is rather clever. But the writer and director don't have the skills to make it really sing. Masterson can't make up the difference. What's interesting is how Depp And Julianne Moore step up to their characters.

Depp is quite capable of playing several characters at once. Here he plays the charming goof the director wants, the man (as comedic presence) the goof wishes he was; and the man behind the mask showing a wink. He's something, but not precisely controllable. He seems to need weak directors. If he has a strong but dumb director (like Hallestrom), he's loses fire. Here, he's hot.

Julianne did this very small role while in her Vanya exercises, filmed the next year. She was also prepping for Altman's "Short Cuts." In those two films (and in others since), she plays several levels simultaneously. Only Cate Blancett and Kate Winslet and Julianne among film actresses can do this. Shows here too. Watch when Depp first plays her playing the horror movie role and tease out the layers: she sees an actor (Depp) acting an actor (Sam) acting an actor (Keaton) acting an actor (Ruthie) who is acting (the horror sister), and reacts on all layers.

The writer intended to use the common metaphor of trains going through these layers: 'Training,' get it? but he missed.

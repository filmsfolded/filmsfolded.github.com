Spoilers herein.

I am a sucker for date movies: I laugh and cry - especially cry - along with the rest.  And then feel violated afterwards by the asymmetry of reward: they get my money time  and a piece of my soul and I get useless platitudes.

This case is no different so far as formulaic and trivial romance. That's the nature of film  love. But I did get something different here that made this worthwhile: competent writing  for once.

And yes, much of the writing - the structure I mean - is formulaic, but it was so well  done. The matter is ordinary, but the manner of the machinery was novel.

This film follows several recent experiments in presenting several stories that annotate  one idea. The principle is that film abstracts and reduces, so if you want to get depth,  you have to combine several reductions. '13 Conversations About One Thing,' 'Things  You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her,' 'Ten Tiny Love Stories' and several others follow  this route.

The idea is that there is one prototypical woman, or couple. What you see as narrative  are different dimensions of that. The problem for the writer is one of folded structure. Each  individual story has to engage and have a dramatic arc, because that's where the viewers'  attention will be. 

But the whole composition has to be woven into one experience, and that needs  traditional cinematic shape as well.

To help with this, the writer Curtis has pulled a number of tricks:

-this is a piece of film writing, so some of his characters are in film (the sex body  doubles) or writers (Firth) or in publishing (Rickman and his company including Linney).  The Nighy character is a performer as well, often on TeeVee and provides the structural  link to...

-the tremendously effective integration of song and narrative. Song interfaces with the  story in as many ways as there are stories: as traditional background, as a plot point:  Joanna and Billy Mack, as a plot action (the kids, Grant's two adventures), as both in the  Joni Mitchell bit.. And on and on in so many ways this could be as varied with song  narrative as 'Citizen Kane' meets 'Singing Detective.'

-The art of 'bracketing.' That's where you set outposts that are intended to be different  and unsuccessful so that the middle is raised. For instance, the 'love' is bracketed on  one side by the absurdly fantastic Wisconsin sequence and the heavily U.N. Date- movieish Linney problem with her brother. These were supposed to stand out, be  different in tone and outside the main machinery.

Other bracketing is obvious: the easy sex/love (Liam meets Claudia) and the seemingly  impossible in the rock star's. This latter is emphasized in his sexy vixen video. And again  between the love without sex (the love for the best friend's wife) and the sex without  love (the body doubles).

Yes, this is all known and taught. But it is good to see it all pulled off.

The director Curtis pulls a great strategy:

-write something extremely tight

-get the most talented and independent actors possible

-get out of their way

One can see that the acting styles here are incoherent. They clearly do not spring from  one mind, rather reflect whatever philosophy that actor has. This would be a flaw in  another film, but here, the whole idea is to have different dimensions as part of the  whole.

Spoilers herein.

By now you know that this is lovely but lacking in passion in pretty much the same ways as  Porter's songs. The story itself is mundane and much better done in 'Carrington' which  incidentally stars Pryce, the visiting angel/creator in this case.

You may have also read arguments about the fidelity in which the songs were presented (I  liked Crow's rendition) - or that some songs were placed out of period. Or as ever, there is  the still commentable notion that his male liaisons were somehow something more than  mere sensual gluttony. At least here we've avoided the 'he needs deviation and resulting  pain to create' stereotype to be replaced by its equally odious opposite.

For me, the story has the normal place stories do in musicals: as the thinnest of disposal  excuses to build a narrative that supports shifting from theater to music. Usually, the shift is  a casual thing. Sometimes in the old days, the story included some performance.

In this case, the same guy who gave us the folded, selfreferencial 'Strange Days' (a film  about films) gives us this: a movie about a play-as-life, which dips into segments of that life  (which includes performances), which is a life about a maker of shows. And finally we have  some hints, but not as many as in 'Suddenly Last Summer,' that living exuberantly outside  the lines is both a show (even a dance) and a life in itself.

These five or six levels are what the music bridges, sometimes in small jumps, sometimes  large. It is a wonderful construction, even if bloodless. It is just the sort of movie referenced  in the movie with the 'be a clown' bit. Reminded me a lot of the 'Penzance' where I first  encountered Kevin, but transformed into a 'Day for Night' version of 'Night and Day.'

I've found Winkler's direction too obvious in the past. But here he seems to understand that  there needs to be cinematic bridges among the layers of abstractions. So we have huge  tracking and sweeping shots. Many of these span different scopes: time, space, memory, and  levels. There's nothing new in this, but with the music (whose lyrics are stretched a bit to  also be ambiguous), it works better than usual.

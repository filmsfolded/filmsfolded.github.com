I almost never watch a film that gives no pleasure at all. In fact, many bad films are bad in interesting ways, especially those derived from comics.

These things might have a compelling alternative reality or mythology. It could have some amusing humor, often self-referential. Or it could -- rarely -- have a story and characters that actually engage. Effects can sometimes even carry the show.

None of that here. Just dull, thudding pain behind your eyes.

This is nominally a Brosnon-style revenge deal: the good guy has his family destroyed and he becomes a superhuman somewhat invulnerable vengeance machine. The only small twist in this case it that the bad guy (Travolta) is also motivated by revenge.

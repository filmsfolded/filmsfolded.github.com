Spoilers herein.

There are some plot elements of this film you should look out for in the beginning. 

Our hero, Sean -- probably gay -- is the trailer editor for Canyon Films (which you can see from the door). In real life, that is Conrad Hall's company, the two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer. Hall won for 'Butch and Sundance,' and 'American Beauty' and is a giant talent in Hollywood. So right away, you know a key awareness in this film is religious issues associated with light and heartbeats (in film terms: lighting and editing). Sean is supposed to be editing the trailer for 'Kid Zombie,' (an obvious reference to the target audience) and takes a week away to attend his sister's wedding on the other coast.

It is a crude framing, at about the low level of skill shown elsewhere in the film, but very clearly deliberate. The notion is that this film is a film about flash editing, and the controller of that heartbeat is INSIDE the film. That's why we get the disappearing girls in the corvette, which can be explained no other way than the magic of immersion, rather like entering Toontown. The best of the Freddy Kreuger films used this device as well. So did the recent 'Cut.' Actually lots of recent horror. Some pretty rich stuff to play with such framing, but here only superficially tapped: the telepathy; the film-as-taxidermy 'holy ground' at the end; the entering of yet another world (inside the vampire world which is inside the film world) to raid the redneck dunebuggy campground, the taking of the "heart" out of that world...

Anyway, since the film is about editing, one can comment that though the kids making it try valiantly, this film would have been improved enormously if the editor had been, well, not on vacation.

Miko is a mere mewing mammary manikin, but Phina Oruche (alone in the cast) does some real acting. Her job is to draw victims away from the light, and also serve as the errant Crusader's concubine. Note the new origin of vampires this film creates: Cursed crusaders, which makes Phina's malevolent Moor meaningful. (How long will it be before Hollywood allows Arab girls to be sex objects?)

With a little bit of such work on the part of the viewer, this film can be watchable, and more.

What if you were a screenwriter who knew his business, and you sat down to write a script, a sweet play intended to be effective and endear. And suppose you knew some talent would be involved so you could avoid the cheapest of tricks.

And that you had in front of you all the devices and parts of past movies to borrow and use.

You'd look at French films. But they (in 1977) weren't sweet, and wouldn't be until "Amelie." Similarly, Italian films could be romantic, excessively so, but they suffer from being too "real." You'd likely choose to start with a French movie (and setting and devices) and end with an Italian one, with its locations and images.

"Italian for Beginners" did something like this, ending almost identically in Venice.

So. Start with a wonderful fantasy: a man and woman meet in Paris. They are, essentially, children, but we are carefully told they are supergeniuses who read existentialism. They meet literally in the middle of a movie, and that movie folds into their reality. They are living and writing their own movie as they go. "Breathless"-wise and so noted. The movie begins in a theater, then segues to the making of a movie. Then our couple enters a world populated by a film icon, Olivier, who in life is an elaborate actor, playing a character who himself is an elaborate actor. He drives the couple into deeper fantasy, possibly true fantasy.

That's the endearment of this small thing, whether fantasy is true, can be. To underscore the point, there is a long beginning sequence of well known American movies dubbed into French. Also, we have the 13 year old Diane Lane, never so innocently wide-eyed, who encounters a porno movie and quickly advises us that it isn't "real." You will, if you are the writer, have our guide Olivier (who we learn steals from the pockets of others) take our couple from the French movie (where they have no future) to an Italian one, where they do.

Its a bet based on past winners (including "Bicycle Thief") and the story denotes this by funding the trip with a bet based on the odds.

We end up in Venice, cheering for our couple as they are pursued by the director (who, incidentally is trying to steal the girl's mother into HIS movie). The couple hides out in yet another movie theater ("The Sting," by the director of this movie, this time of course in Italian), then performs their promised ritual union.

Tack on an ending where the girl safely escapes the adventure, and send it to the scriptgirl. You have a hit.

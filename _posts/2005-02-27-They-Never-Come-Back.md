In "Barton Fink," the title character goes to Hollywood and ends up writing a wrestling picture, like Hemingway. The entire story is weighted with the ponderously bad notion of a movie that starts with such an idea. The Hollywood bosses care nothing about the story at all except that it have a couple fights and dancing girls and a romance. Oh, and some intrigue.

Well, that's what some meatgrinder produced in this case.

I see my comment is the first, so some story synopsis is in order.

Jimmy is a good fighter who looses after hearing his mother died. In the process, he permanently injures his arm. A woman in the audience soon gives him a job as bouncer in a club. He falls for the head hoochy girl, though both are swell folks.

But the club owner lusts after the same girl, so he arranges for the brother of that very girl to frame our fighter for theft. He had to you see because he was caught stealing $1,000 himself. So our fighter goes to prison, but doesn't mind because his girl visits frequently.

Meanwhile, the framing brother falls in love with the fighter's sister! He confesses to his sister and she determines to repay the $1,000 and get him off the hook. The fighter is released and thinks the girl is two-timing. That's fixed. So he arranges a fight for $1,000 if he simply goes three rounds with a famed bruiser. 

Naturally he gets pulverized, until thinking about his great girl, then he wins! On to the club where he pays off the bad boss and slugs him as well. Both couples bask in happiness.

Worthy of Hemingway.

Its fun walking through movies from an era where the stage had not yet migrated away from the screen. It was possible, for instance for Fred Astair to be in the funky bowels of a coal- fired ship and have us presented with a polished floor and musically clanking stage engine parts. 

This sort of stage/reality merger is not possible today, even in "musicals" and its quite a cinematic jolt, even though expected.

But supposing you aren't tuned the way I am, there are still three very nice things here. In the order they appear:

-- The story is about a man (a dancer) who sees a picture of a woman (who happens to also be a dancer) and falls in love with her. But her appeal should be something to do with how she dances, right? And pictures don't dance. Ah, but they do; we are shown a flip book, consisting of photos from a film. Flip the pages and you see her dance. Stare a moment and the flipbook seamlessly transforms into the film of her dancing. Its a film within that could as easily from that point be the guy's fantasy. This ability to play fast and loose with reality, film and show is unique, I think, to the 30s.

-- We've come to see Fred and Ginger dance. But we've seen them before, and the truth is that no matter how talented they are, its much the same from one film to the next. So what to do? Well, you add two gimmicks. One is not interesting to me: Fred "mixes" ballet and tap. The other is pretty amazing: Fred and Ginger dancing as a couple on roller skates! Now this is pretty darn amazin'. They both seem to completely understand gravity as visionary mystics. That's what its all about, is transcendence. Its what makes her sexy as heck and he classy.

-- The final big number has two devices that impressed. The first and most visually cinematic is the set. It is a huge cylinder with many vertical doors behind which dancing girls appear and vanish. This is expertly designed and photographed, the only thing here that is. The other device is that the scores of girls wear Ginger masks. She has left him and re-appears behind one of the masks. Oh, you should know that the story, thin as it is, is based on false presentations like this.

If you are surveying Godzilla films, this has two things that make it stand out. One is the twin priestesses, who I think are photographed better and longer here than elsewhere. The second thing is that this is dubbed more expertly than others I have seen.

Otherwise, the interesting thing here is the same as for all the Godzilla films. If you want to appreciate Hayao Miyazaki and his fascination with nature sprites and monsters (and you are not Japanese) you need to touch base with something in this series. This one features four giant creatures: Godzilla who is a sort of prehistoric lizard; the people-friendly Mothra; its cousin, a giant condor; and new to this film a giant lobster.

All of these were created or awakened by nuclear activity which was then burned deep into Japanese cosmology. The bad guys here? They are making nuclear weapons.

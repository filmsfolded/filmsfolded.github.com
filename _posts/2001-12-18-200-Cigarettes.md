Spoilers herein.

At first, I saw this picture as representing what it really was: a collection of aspiring (but generally second-string) actresses looking to be involved in a sleeper, intelligent independent film. The metaphor of a buncho sex-starved girls looking for a party was especially apt. The 'boys' each represent an indie consequence: it could take a modest talent to great heights (Ben Affleck), or be a casual hoot (the black cabbie) or various shades in between. If they don't hook up here, they are cursed for a year, I guess until the next possibility of an intelligent film.

I came to this because Garofalo's name was on it, but you get only the faintest scent of her here. Musky, old but pleasant. And then it dawned on me, this is Elvis Costello's star vehicle!

MTV has a theory of homeopathic presence: the less one appears in an ensemble, the stronger the impact. Elvis makes NO appearance whatsoever in the moving picture part of this project (except his name and glasses), only seen in a coda of stills. And they are not of the party we saw (this dreary picture), but the party we missed (the mythical film that really was a life altering experience).

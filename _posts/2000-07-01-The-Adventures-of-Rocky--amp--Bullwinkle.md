This movie is as bad as Inspector Gadget, perhaps worse because name actors are involved.

There is one redeeming curiosity: the solution to the 3D characters. Here, they had to keep the look of the originals, which were very cheap, even in the 60s. But they also wanted them to be 3D instead of using the Roger Rabbit model.

The result is an odd set of tradeoffs: These are balloon-figures, with smooth surfaces. This means Rocky's wing-membranes are discarded. Shading is one-tone. Each character has an outline, which I understand was quite a challenge. But they have motion-blurring. Mouths never really open.

The whole thing is curiously off-kilter, but it is no weirder than Disney's talking dinosaurs I suppose.

Spoilers herein.

Rarely do we get a film that is honest, so we should celebrate this.

Lesser films think that cinematic truth can come from a particularly 'real' story, usually brutal. Or in veristic performances. But they can never carry the power of visual integrity. Not in film.

Here, we stumble through a wilderness of images discovering for ourselves what is going on. We find, of course that souls never bond, that nature is rugged and capricious, and that love is all nature is. Hardy's story is blunt, but no matter. It is completely submerged. The eye dominates, leads the narrative. 

And the score! I'll travel distance to hear Nyman's work. Since his early integration with Greenaway's vision, he has repeatedly placed our ears behind the director's eye, with a congruent consciousness.

Check this out. Insecure bonding. Always the promise of stability, always around the corner -- always tentative bonds that test our control over them.

If you love film, travel with this one a while. Your relationship to it will also be enticing but loose -- tight, deep connections punctuated by impatient annoyance. It will come to you, like a casually purchased wife, like a dragged house (as also in 'Oscar and Lucinda'), like the promise of electricity to bring you back from the dead, like a future rail line, like welcome death in the cold.

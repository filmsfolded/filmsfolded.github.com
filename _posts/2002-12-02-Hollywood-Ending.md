Spoilers herein.

My warmest memory of Woody is as Mr. Alien, the Fool in Godard's 'King Lear.' Here was the acknowledged master of self-referential films (in the film theory world read: reflexive) paying homage to the unacknowledged master. Woody's early films were intelligently engineered treatises on films about films, but as he aged he tried all sorts of different things. Many of these don't work: he never stays in one corner these days well enough to master it. But no matter what, all of these have some deep awareness of films about filming. My personal favorite is 'Sweet and Lowdown' which is as subtle as you can get in this regard.

The problem with Woody is that he is a superb conceptualist, so as a writer he is among the few best we have. As a director, he's competent enough. As an actor, he ruins most things he's in if just from the mania-induced flailing. Often, he plays jokes on us by moving the focus to him the actor and some obvious device, but the film's nearly invisible soul is about a much richer harmonic on that theme.

Here he distracts us by the simple, 'Player' -like satire with a 'Producer' -like ending. We are expected to leave the theater with the obviously prepackaged conclusion that the film we just saw was as bad as the film we saw being made. Look again. This is not what I consider successful art, but there is a method here: one extended from Godard's notion of intelligent chaos.

Debra Messing plays his redhaired girlfriend, with a role not unlike that of Molly Ringwald in 'Lear.' The difference is that with Godard's project, no one could possibly be fooled into thinking they understand it. What Woody's done here is place us in the role of the French in 'City that Never Speaks' -- we actually think we understand this. Its an elaborate joke, but that's what the man is all about these days, I think.

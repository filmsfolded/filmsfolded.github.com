I think I like "Muriel's Wedding," which covered the same general territory, better.

Superficially, this is a story about a girl in a boy's body. At least all the descriptions and summaries say so. And the parents in this think so. It isn't a life, only a couple weeks, and we have no idea what happens to this child. Even though a joke is made of misunderstanding the science of sex, the characters here (and the filmmaker too, it seems) conflate homosexual, transgender, hermaphrodite and crossdressing behavior.

(There should be a word for this class. But I suppose anyone in it would exclude some others.)

Never mind. The gender business is merely an excuse to explore deeper issues of disconnection between child and parent. Though I suspect few viewers will have had similar gender confusion, all will resonate to how difficult it is to make the story you inhabit.

This is a movie with the child's movie within. Following Ted's rule, the level of abstraction between the movie and the movie within is the same distance as between the movie and us.

Its well enough engineered to make you cry.

Spoilers herein.

The first rule of screenwriting: if you are going to try something quirky, or ironic or a synthesis of genres, you have to tell the audience where the ground is. It is not true that you have to have a clear focus, in my mind. Lots of film dance about and try on various tones. The viewer can handle it if they have some sort of an anchor. Doesn't take much, but that is missing here.

Oh well. At least it has:

--One of the best boogie to music scenes I can recall.

--A pretty good house. These are surprisingly rare. Look around your next few films to see what I mean.

--It has some pretty poor filmmaking, but at least one delicious scene. Where one of the sisters (Bullock I think) is driving to see her sister, we see her in her car with the scene changing to night and then back. Its pretty original I think and very, very effective. If there were more like this, the movie would have been magical.

--It has several redheads. I've become fascinated with how they are used in film. Few things in film are by chance and even fewer mean nothing. Here we have three generations of sisters and each consists of a brown and a red. means something. I'll figure it out and get back to you.

--Speaking of Nicole, she's wasted here. But there is one 'actor's moment.' Actors like to act characters that are actors, or are retarded, or are possessed. hat's because they can explicitly play two levels at once. Toward the end here, we have a possessed Nicole, and for that brief moment when he/she is enticed with a bottle, Nicole's talent comes through. The rest is all boogie, though. Hard to believe just four years later that Sandra Bullock gets billing over Nicole.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.

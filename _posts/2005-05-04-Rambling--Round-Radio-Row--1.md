See if you can find some of these to watch.

They are shorts and hard to find. The experience of watching is mundane in itself. After all, these are second rate players doing offhand skits and songs. Its the idea that's worth dipping into.

Movies and radio grew up together, each searching for its identity. By this time, movies were firmly mature as storytelling vehicles. while radio was turning out skits and songs. Often they overlapped, and where they do its fascinating. 

What we have here is radio with pictures: skits directed at faint amusement and songs. But radio had already become cinematic. Just imagine Charlie McCarthy, a radio ventriloquism act! So what movies are borrowing from radio are what radio borrowed from movies and refined.

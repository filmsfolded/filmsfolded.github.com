Spoilers herein.

TeeVee documentaries fascinate me. In general, they contain some spoken text which conveys the real information, with images that don't particularly add any information. Instead, the pictures seem intended to occupy that part of our attention that wanders so that the voice can do its work. That's the basic nature of TeeVee news: the pictures don't tell you anything and because of the limited vision actually distort.

But this material was potentially different. Nazism was all about images and their manipulation in popular media, especially film. So I was expecting something special: a powerful set of images about a powerful set of images, and perhaps why/how they 'turned evil.' Possibly no subject offers such a rich opportunity to break out of the TeeVee 'voice with pictures' model.

But I was disappointed. The voice gives good enough information if you know nothing about the subject, though it is repetitive in the three disks and clearly cribbed wholesale from the few studies on the subject. But even this is substantially less information than you can read in about the same time. For instance, they leave out all the 'hollow earth' stuff and most of the Fire and Ice science. They left out the similar racial jingoistic, Kabbalistic ideas that grew up in the Jewish community in parallel, ideas which lent some superficial legitimacy to what the Austrians were inventing.

But the truly odd thing was how little the images had to do with what was being said. Yes, they were all German films from the period, but they informed little. 

In this case, go to a library and leave these alone.

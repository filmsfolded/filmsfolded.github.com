This has only two things. In between are all sorts of dead things. Strange because this follows the Disney Zorro convention that the point or edge of the sword is never used. The bad guys are knocked down or hit with the hilt. No point.

The two good things:

-- Following the regular convention, the thing starts off with a slap-dash action episode. Like the second "Charlie's Angels," this is spectacular. It must have been directed by a different guy. It is worth watching.

-- Then of course we have dreariness, stupidity and bad dialog. A standard train episode. The Buster Keaton bit. Then we have an explosion. Explosions are expected, huge orange fireballs. But this one seemed better than normal. Sad to say, but it stood out only because everything else was borrowed so lamely.

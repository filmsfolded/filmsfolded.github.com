It seems the pleasure of watching Ed Wood for most is a sort of trailer park voyeurism. Most films really take a lot of work, even fluffy stuff if you want to avoid vegetative manipulation. Wood allows even the laziest of minds to feel that they more than master the experience.

But watch out, this one is pretty tricky. Sure, it is cheesy and every production element is hokey. But this is always a matter of degree; after all, most pictures are hokey, they just seduce us into filling in the gaps ourselves.

This movie features a fellow who likewise produces cheesy, hokey shows with incredibly bad production. His seances feature, among other laughable items, a eye on a string. It is a plastic eye and rotates so that the cylindrical back is clearly visible. The show Dr Acula puts on follows Ted's Law of shows within shows: the difference between the two is the same as between the first and real life.

In this case, that means that level of cheesiness between an ordinary film and this is the same as between this and the show Acula produces. 

There's also a curious framing: the thing is introduced and narrated by a character in a coffin (very goofily) and he appears within the story as well. Yes, you guessed it: as a revived corpse.

Here's the twist: despite Acula's ignorance, his fakery, his cheapness, his avarice, his power is greater than he knows -- and greater than the audience suspects until the end.

Yes, his faked show does succeed in doing the real thing. Does Ed Wood's? Well, yes if you credit Burton, Waters or Russell. Watch "You'll find out" for the reverse story and effect.

I don't know the personalities involved in writing this, and I assume there was a script doctor in the mix as well. But you can surely see a splice here between two movies.

The first is a standard formula, a drudge through the required steps. This subgenre of the date movie starts with some deception, then the two "actually" fall in love. Then discovery of the deception, distance and reconciliation to a presumed perfect and enduring happiness.

There are all sorts of problems with the formula. One is to make the deceiver seem less despicable. That's a particular problem here because our female lead is one of the least appealing actresses in her appearance and manner that I know. Walk through just the past year and you see how this was handled (with a huge investment in time) in "Wedding Crashers." No such preparation here.

The second problem with the formula is that it is a formula. In these movies we need the predictability but also want to fool ourselves into believing it is fresh and new. 

So what they've done this time is allow the main movie to exist in its skeletal machinery and have surrounded it with a second movie, three stories of the quirky surrounding characters: his buddies, his parents and her roommate.

They've been designed to cover a spectrum of wackiness so that we'll believe the spine of the thing is a screwball comedy. At the far end of this wackiness is the roommate of our professional deceiver, played by the remarkable Zooey Deschanel. He IMDb profile notes that she is an admirer of Parker Posey, and it shows, She's a keeper.

Her bit includes a war with a mockingbird. You can just see how this appeared to the writer when wondering about parallel notions that echo the main one. She encounters this mockingbird with her date (obtained under both false pretenses and some deception) and finds true love, and they together pull on the main story to make it turn out okay.

To make this work, such as it does, there has to be a role for "nature" in the main story, so we have three episodes, presumably comic, where a docile animal bites our lead guy because, you see, he is out of tune with nature.

Then, once those script elements are shivved in, you can see how other apparently odd ones appear. When our boy moves out, we discover the dad having a "natural" relationship with his fish (feeding them nude). And since there is a third buddy, and he needs to find love too, we tie him up with a waitress who he impulsively kisses at the end -- only because she is nearby -- and finds his true love. (The whole idea behind these is to defeat -- however temporarily -- the notion that love is hard to find.)

Students of scriptwriting will be impressed with the end. All of these things require a folded narrative, meaning in this case one that creates an audience in the movie, then associates the theater audience with the one they see. As the one in the film cheers and gets engaged, it makes it easier for us.

So what we have at the end is a plot device that takes the action in the movie and turns it into a movie within the movie. As the final "decision" happens, a huge crowd gathers to watch just as we are.

It is mechanical and predictable in a way. But if you go to these to understand love -- as we all really do -- you might want to notice that it isn't about love, but the stories of love. And there is something to learn there, even in this honker.

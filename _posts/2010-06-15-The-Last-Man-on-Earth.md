The history behind this is pretty fascinating. 

Well practiced writer makes books with the intent of having them filmed. He invents the notion of a virus (sometimes called a germ) that kills people, but they revive as vampirelike, slowwitted killers. Many vampire qualities are preserved: aversion to mirrors, intolerance for sunlight, need for blood. This movie was more than five years before Romero started the zombie genre, clearly borrowing and de-sciencing.

The film was made in Italy because of problems that Hammer was having with US censors! Yes, folks. True. 

The original author was so appalled by this adaptation, he removed his name.

You will likely find the actual movie unsatisfying. It was remade more successfully twice. But there is some interesting narrative history. We have three movie versions now, each with superficially similar endings. In fact, on the "I Am Legend" DVD, we have a rather lovely alternative ending, so four.

The narrative effect is radically different in each of the five cases (including the book). 

In this case, our survivor is a research physician, someone who had been working on a cure before the catastrophe. After the massive infection, he does not spend his time on further research. Rather he takes it on himself to kill the vampires and burn the bodies of the dead. 

This he does with wooden stakes and it is no accident that Vincent Price plays the doctor. "Doctor" in this narratives hearkens back to the conventional Frankenstein and Dracula narratives. Before the noir genre congealed around the detective, the doctor -- the man of science -- was a contender for our default on-screen surrogate.

Apparently, in this movie, the undead kill each other for food. Unexplained is why these second-time victims need to be burned.

All of the versions end up with humanity possibly being saved. The alternative ending for the later movie is the most satisfying, but this film has an interesting twist.

The doctor is immune because on a tropical trip he was bitten by a presumably weakly infected bat, giving him antibodies. He only thinks that his blood could be valuable late in the game. The scientist in this version is not on a quest to save lives. There is no role for science in the story, only to set up the story, explaining things. 

The ending is ambiguous. Our hero is by some in-betweeners, infected people who have a temporary treatment. But we know a woman survives who now carries Price's antibodies. Will she be used, or will the in-betweeners prefer the state they have? We don't know. 

I will not give spoilers for the following versions, but will note that here there is no quest, no intent to understand, nor desire to help. So the sacrifice is wasted. We seem to need to know that body was spent for something desired.

So, not a good movie, but interesting as the place where the zombie myth and genre started. The term was around in film since 1932, but would not be applied to this phenomenon for five years.

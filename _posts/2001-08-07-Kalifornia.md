Spoilers herein.

The writer is in charge of this film. Writers like to write about writing, and in this case, he brings a photographer. What is written about and photographed is Brad Pitt. This is his  most committed performance before 'Fight Club.' Surely informs some of his later roles.

Sena is what's interesting here. He has an edge which shows in his eye, as the photographer that goes further than the writer. Is this the same guy who did the execrable 'Gone in 60 Seconds?' At least he had some similarly self-referential scenes in 'Swordfish.'

Why is violence cinematic? Why do we ride the 'doors?' What's in it for us? What would have made this film great? I'll propose some of 'Switchback.'

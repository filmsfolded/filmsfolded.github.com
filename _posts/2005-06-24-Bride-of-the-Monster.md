Sure Ed Wood movies are cheesy and humorless, so are apt fodder for people looking for something to belittle.

But I'm not one to let a bad execution get in the way of a good movie. In the "sequel" to this, there really was a cool, worthwhile concept. This one lacks that, but it makes up for it in my mind through the much celebrated performance of Lugosi.

As much as I appreciate the Burton version of the history, I like the real thing so much better.

Here was a man deep in the mysteries of the devil via drugs. Here was a man whose life consisted of the sort of cheap props that feature in this story. Here is a man who could and did hypnotize millions of "visitors" (filmgoers). And a man who was destroyed by his own creation.

Man and character, truth and play all here for us to see. This is no mere funhouse, kiddies. This is the real thing, real experimentation turned evil, beyond deadly.

I thank Tod Browning for starting this metamovie, and Burton for finishing it. But for the actual corpse, you have to visit this house.

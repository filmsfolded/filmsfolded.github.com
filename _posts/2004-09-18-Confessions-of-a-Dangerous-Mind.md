Spoilers herein.

Yet another example of why even the best actors cannot be trusted with intelligent material. They just don't have the skills required. But this is a pretty good try, better than most films in fact.

Here's the setup: a man invents a role for himself in a created world; that 'self' is in show business and he creates yet another world and persona for himself. Both selves write a book from a . All three levels are shown here, all sliced and diced according to Kaufman's clever folding techniques.

Clooney plays the great manipulator of one of these levels (the CIA) and is also the grand manipulator of the top level, this film. He does a great job in some respects by creating great scenes that shift from one layer or time to another. These are very clever and worth watching on their own.

But it just isn't enough. Part of the problem is that Kaufman's original notions weren't followed. They moved the narrative stance into extremely strange territory with several untrusted narratives. These were ditched. The producers weren't as crazy as Barris, which is a real shame.

But the other problem is that too much emphasis is placed on doing a good job from the perspective of the actors. All the scenes are shaped for the benefit of the actors, all towards clarity. Should have been shaped as a multi layered ambiguous unit, just as Kaufman envisioned.

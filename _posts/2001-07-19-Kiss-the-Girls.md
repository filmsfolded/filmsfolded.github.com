Spoilers herein.

No film genre is more demanding of good writing and vision, and nothing gets screwed up quite as badly as the mystery thriller.

This type of film needs to suck you in through the mental challenge, the intricacies of the narrative, the alien laws at work. If done cleverly, the viewer/detective becomes immersed and vulnerable to whatever manipulations the filmmaker has in store. 

What's missing here is everything. Freeman in particular ticks me off. He's of the naturalistic school of acting, something akin to modeling. He doesn't put out for us, or the director -- he just shows up and puts on an avuncular face.

No one else on screen is sufficiently in command either. But all that wouldn't hurt so much if there was some craft in the story. Studios think it enough (post 'Seven' and 'Silence') to have genius criminals doing incredibly clever things.

This is not an intelligent film, and it should be. Avoid it and its sequel.

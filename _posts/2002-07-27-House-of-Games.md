Spoilers herein.

Even Mamet had to learn. Though this is his most fluid camera, it is a disaster both in writing and directing. 

But Mamet retains his gift for self-reference. So we have a tale of a celebrated professional entering a new world of trickery and illusion. That professional is at first flummoxed, then gets her bearings. It is not enough to save the day. The project must be killed, but at least she saves face and learns enough to do well the next time around. And so it is with Mamet entering film from theater.

Spoilers herein.

Two men, both struggle with love of the same woman and through her, honorable nobility. Everything is done visually. The problem of life here is abstracted from the problem faced by a filmmaker.

And we have the two directors, Kusturica and Auteuil as surrogate for Leconte, who actually directs this film about the passions of directing.

Leconte is as his character, formally schooled, part of an academy and associated dogma: Minimalist, visual in a slick, geometric lush way. Deals with actors as part of a regiment. Clean.

And Kusturica is as his character, unschooled, intuitive, multidimensional, pragmatic, directly but calmly emotional. Deals with actors as part of a fishing crew. Gritty.

They both commit to the same film -- the same woman -- each weaving their own fingers into different parts of our visual mind. There are rough spots were the story takes us to a blunt sequence of saving a house. (How much more gracefully Gillian Armstrong did this with 'Oscar and Lucinda'!) And a distracting subplot concerning the immigrant executioner. The horse business is mishandled because of problems with the camera. Alas.

So things to seem to grind toward the end. But this has as perfect a beginning as one would wish for: every essential element is conveyed without the mechanical exposition usually used. And how effective! Leconte is economical, so presenting the emotional Captain unemotionally is natural. Introducing us to Neel as lost coming from the fog, then being 'saved' by entering a wandering, fishy, dirty brotherhood is perfect. He plays it as if he is bursting with energy, but showing none of it.

Binoche is one of the few women alive who can stand as icon for the French ideal of art: sensual, innocently, purely noble -- translucent heart, stubborn honesty. The camera doesn't have to pull any tricks here. That red dress is an amazing color.

This is very intelligent filmmaking, very cerebral (most of the time) visual storytelling, absolutely self-referential tragedy on the nature of art.

See it. Better yet, see the first half and spend the next few months wondering. You'll thank me for keeping you from becoming a widow.

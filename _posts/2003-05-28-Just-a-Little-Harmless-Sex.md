Spoilers herein.

We all want to be teenagers and some films are built to pander to that drive.

The teenage condition is one in which all things are subservient to sex, but sex isn't something you actually do. It isn't something that is a component of a relationship but something that defines it (and life). It is how you define yourself. Friends exist to talk about things, and since all things ultimately are part of that prime mover, the topic is always sex in some form.

How to engineer a movie for this? Talk talk talk about sex -- don't do it. (Have a strip tease with no stripping.) Have some minidramas on the order of 'going steady' and 'breaking' up, but cast it among grown-ups. That's because the target audience wants to be kids but doesn't see itself as kids. Have lots of 'raw' talk. Have some minor misunderstandings and difficulties that only become large because they have been talked about with friends. Have opportunistic crushes.

Denote the fact that we are generation-hopping by having the 'Mom' be hot and 'in play.' Don't have any redheads because redheads are serious stuff (in movies).

There are several distinct types of science fiction. Probably the least interesting is the type that identifies one single thread or idea from current society and then performs extreme extrapolation into a future so we can see the results, usually negative. You can do this two ways, either to extrapolate everything else in society into the future world, creating a complex futureworld fabric.

Or you can be lazy, or in the case of films cheap, and just extrapolate that one thing. In this case, everything else stays the same. Same elevators, food and so one. That's what we get here. There is no future, and actually some of the extrapolation is into the past as in the 50's style corporate suits.

So we end up with some really unbalanced plot devices that hamstring the story and blunt the effect. For instance is it likely that DNA will be checked just to get into the building, especially by drawing blood? Already, we have relatively cheap biometrics that are more accurate than DNA.

Is it likely that there would not be equally extensive psychological profiling and brain monitoring?

The point is that this is poor scifi, on top of being less than excellent in other respects.

Spoilers herein.

A musical has its own personality, like a new acquaintance. Some are charming, moderately intelligent, a little sexy.

But not this one. None of the characters (or the actors!) are remotely attractive, except for the young Ron Howard and his character. Now that's the kiss of death for me.

And the story; it revolves around the most obnoxious of conceits. It resembles the 'Guys and Dolls' skeleton only superficially. But those characters had some strong connection to our own limits and yearnings. These guys are remote: we see them from outside. The music does blare, but the dances don't snap and flash to the same extent. 

So what we have is a musical that is just like its protagonist: it lies about what it can do to make us at least feel better.

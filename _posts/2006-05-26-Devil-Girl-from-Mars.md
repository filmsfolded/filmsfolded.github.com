Its often the case that science fiction isn't about the science part of the thing. The otherworldliness it provides is often a cover for observations and explorations of one kind or another.

This has three components, and they are so distinct I suspect three different authors. One piece is the enveloping flying saucer visitation. Ho hum.

The main thing is the "locked house" dynamic of an unlikely group of strangers cast together to deal with peril. At the end, one must die so the others can live. Maybe. A scientist (so he can explain things), a reporter (natch), a beautiful model, an escaped murderer (misunderstood) together with the ordinary range of similarly ordinary British country folk. This is mendacious stuff. Ho hum again.

The third piece is the interesting part. Our extraterrestrial visitor is a woman from a planet of women. They had a war with the men and won, so need more men. (They have male robots.) She's in faux leather, and the asexual dominatrix bit is played up. She obliges with many long, wordy explanations of what's going on, because of its origin as a radio play, I suppose.

In those schoolmarmish rants are all sorts of references to the sexual imbalance on Mars. Lots of pseudoscience talk about "inversion" and negative attraction. All the yang opposites the script guy could find. Its played seriously, with no hint of sex or camp, and that fact alone makes this a sort of antiBarbarella. Sadly, the amazingly natural cinematic life of the Barbarella project is absent here. This actually looks like a filmed radio show.

I wonder if science fiction can be sexless like this. You might want to explore the Coppola boy's "CQ" to find out.

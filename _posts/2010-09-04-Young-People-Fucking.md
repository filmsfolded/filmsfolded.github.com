There is something about this idea that really appeals. Generally, when you have these parallel stories, all about the same situation, we can merge them into a complex situation with ambiguities and overt conflicts that get pretty rich. Sex, the actual encounter, is avoided in films. Who really knows why. Though the title is exploitative, the intent seems pretty serious. 

After all, this is the place that gave us Maddin, Cronenberg, Hartley and Egoyan.

Enough of it worked to hold me, and it was clear that the writing was intended to take advantage of the overlap between scenes. But two of them were problematic. One was designed to play with the folded notion that we as ready voyeurs would negatively judge an on-screen voyeur. This really could have anchored the thing but the stance did not merge well with the others and was apparently written by someone else.

A second situation involved an unexpected role reversal, a sort of sexual con within the expected con. But the others worked, finding clever ways to be where we have all been, trying to connect.

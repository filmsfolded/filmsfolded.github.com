Spoilers herein.

This is a film about the dark person we carry inside us and how it appears when imbalance occurs. It has particularly powerful impact when one knows that its box office failure triggered a chronic depression in Henson which continued until his death. That death was preventable, and might be considered the result of depressive behavior. (It occurred the week he was to unload his company on Disney.)

Henson poured his entire, huge store of creativity into the Dark Crystal for five years of his prime, and it failed. Why?

I think the problems were two, tied together. Instead of trusting his own imagination, Henson went to a 'conceptual artist' to get the primary vision for the film. That artist was strong on the character end but had nothing so far as environments. Puppet shows can get by with objects. Fantasy films need an environmental vision. One can see the difference with 'Alien' where the conceptual artist understood environment first, creature second.

The second problem grows out of the first. The story grew from the characters. Henson's (and Oz's too if it matters) intuition is to give meaning to their characters independent of context. Then the story was overlain. The story has some rather deep origins, mostly Kabbalistic, but the expression is thin. No one apparently had the skills to build a compelling narrative.

Missing story and environment, a tragic film.

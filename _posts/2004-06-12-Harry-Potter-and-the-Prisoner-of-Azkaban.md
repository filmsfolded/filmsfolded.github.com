Spoilers herein.

This franchise is being managed extremely well, better than any other. The 'Lord of the  Rings' films were all of a single whole, while these Harry Potter movies are each  cognizant of what went before, changing and maturing just as would an adolescent.

It has little to do with the story, of course and even less with the insipid monsters and  threats. It instead has everything to do with the philosophy of the implied narrator. In the  first film, that narrator was without grounding.

The second film showed a remarkable (for Hollywood) artistic sensibility in rooting the  world of what we see in space. All the important shots were a matter of registration with  the buildings around us, mostly the academy. All of a sudden we were aware that  someone is actually paying attention to how we see what we see.

The jazz in the movie world is now centered on Spanish-speaking fiilmmakers. They  alone seem to have a handle on new ways of introspective folding. So the search was on  to get the best Hispanic they could. This director was their third choice, but still a good  one.

In this case, they rooted the narrator in folded time, and here the story helps a bit. The  subtle suggestion is that we the viewers are the 'dementors,' who hover about and move  much like the camera does. (This very same device was also used in 'Van Helsing.')

Rootless, then space, then time. Wonder where Chris Columbus will take us next?

Emily isn't so redheaded this time.

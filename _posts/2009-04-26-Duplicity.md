Good storytelling matters. It involves various methods of revealing and connecting, moving certain elements closer to each other (and from the story to the reader) and away again, modulating to and from with rhythms negotiated between the maker and viewer.

The con genre takes one thread in this potential symphony and makes it obvious. You get to see the creation and "selling" of a fictional story in the fictional story you are watching. You expect to be shifting between modes, or "folds" as sometimes you see things that the target dupe does not, but you will be fooled.

Add to that the dimension of the romantic con. Its a subgenre by itself and one I really enjoy. Its what I would call a third fold, where we have characters trying to present a folded story to the targets, the writer presenting one -- perhaps a different one -- to us, and two characters involved in a romance, to each other. 

The fun is in how these modulate with one another in their content and rhythm, especially when it comes to the most intimate parts. Most of us are not spies, or con men. But we all understand romance, and the collaborative stories we build with our loves, how those stories often survive on the tension of difference, and just as often disintegrate.

That's why I was looking forward to this so. I expected that it would be well structured, that with this budget it would be something that engages, that works. The studio thought so, it seems, as they more than doubled their risk with a rich promotional budget. Julia Roberts is a mess, and hasn't been a real actress since 1994. But she still is bankable. 

The problem is that she doesn't understand what to do, and would have killed this movie even if all else would have been perfect. She is the key, the one we watch. Early in the film, we see that she is set up to be the master of the con, of the sexual relationship and of the screen. The default is that we expect her to fool the two companies in some clever way, getting all the money, and at the same time fool her lover/partner, but probably choose to be with him. The undertone is that she chooses to be with him because she masters the story.

In the end, we find that this expectation is generally true, but the environment unexpectedly takes the money. 

So we need her to do what I call folded acting. She needs to be IN the stories she controls and the same time we can see her sparkle in the control of them. That there are many interwoven stories makes this challenge significant. Cate Blanchette and a few others could have done this. But the botox-paralyzed Roberts is so outgunned, it is painful to watch. She's lost. She's the dupe.

So that would have killed it, at least for me. Because of Julia's dullness and the brilliance of Wilkinson and Giamatti, it is hard to see how broken the script is. But it is. You need snap and energy in at least one of the threads, presumable the sexual one. It is not here. You need modulation among the threads and weaving. It is not present. You need some parts where the sheer fun of achievement makes you cheer for the couple as a couple. Nope.

What we get instead is a novel, "replay" format so that instead of having things revealed the normal way, reinventing what you knew from before, we literally see scenes from the past that perform this re-invention. It is novel. And I think it would have worked -- especially because there is a triple twist around one scene where the two first meet as operatives for their companies.

But it does not. For this to work narratively, the new insight has to not only replace by fiat what we knew, but it has to "make more sense." Gilroy does not understand this.

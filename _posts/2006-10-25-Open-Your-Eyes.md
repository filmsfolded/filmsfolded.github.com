Here's an interesting case, where the Hollywood remake is better.

First, an exploration of why I didn't particularly like this. Superficially I should. I'm fascinated by films that are about films or something like them: manufactured illusion. And its especially nice when characters wonder about where they belong, which layer of reality is true, what it means to be fabricated and how to jump levels. Its all about lucidity.

But I'm interested in this because I'm interested in tricks that storytellers can use to make their stories more engaging. So its important to me that when these devices are used, they are used to "fold" the audience into the story. For instance, a simple fold is when we have an on- screen audience that our characters perform to.

Its all a much grander and richer notion than self-reference or reflexivity. Worthy of knowing because of the way we build our own stories in life, often using movies.

These storytelling devices, a bewildering variety of them are most employed by our Spanish- related filmmakers. Okay, now this.

The story in its details is just this sort of thing. But look closely. It is a story that exists independent of the cinematic means to tell it. It uses no cinematic techniques, like say the wonderful "Sex and Lucia." It seems to have been conceived as a book, with no visual hook. Things are "explained." There are some devices like the mask and the mime, but they are grafted on the story-as-words not the story-as-images.

To see what I mean, see this and the remake. Crowe is no master filmmaker, but he does know a few things about migrating a story into cinema. Watch it. Its almost precisely the same script, and has Penelope as well. It has Cruise, possibly an apt choice for a self-absorbed man who admires how he is admired. But it also has some very clever touches that aren't in the original. My two favorite are the talk about who was your favorite Beatle, and the insertion of Alicia Witt as the secretary at "the company."

That Beatles bit showed that Crowe understood the nature of the defect in the original and the mechanics of projection needed to bring the story into the cinematic. Beatle Paul is the right answer there, and the mechanism has to do with shifting identity, not keeping the same identity in a shifted reality.

And the insertion of the redhead was a kind of ultracinematic shorthand. Some people, objects, shots, effects carry special meaning. This woman, as a girl, stunned the film world in how Lynch used her in the otherwise unimaginative "Dune." For years afterward she was inserted in movies to recall that role, or rather the place those few minutes represented. Its the notion that a woman can appear once in your vision and every element of the world is different after that, sort of a diffuse witchcraft of noir. That she was there showed us, the audience that Crowe understood what he was reaching for.

None of that is here in the original. Its a rather conventional sci-fi story told in the most mechanical of ways with no mixing of the confusions of reality in the story with the realities of film. And us.

And wasn't there some added ambiguity in "Vanilla" about the detective being the hero's father?

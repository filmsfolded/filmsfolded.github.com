Let me tell you, this scared the patootie out of me when I was a kid. And that's what I would have called it.

The effects seemed real at the time. That shock of color at the end was effective in the day. And it followed a now common rule: to threaten the demographic of the viewers. In the first one it was drive-in movie watchers. In this one is junior high schoolers on a field trip.

Now it is all too silly of course, and in a way that reminds me of something important.

Many of our urges like fear, love, drive to pride and such are borrowed or shaped by the movies. And not just urges, basic ideas about the shape of the arc and the phrasing of life's episodes. Just think about scary things. The scary things we had in those days were the things that could be filmed. Guys in rubber suits. Sometimes claymation. And often what we have here, big things.

I know it seems silly to think about how what we have today limits our imagination. But think: fighting with lighted sticks, space weapons no different than today's guns, spaceships that deliberately look, act and sound like old planes. 

Books (and possibly radio) will always be where science fiction is the richest.

Spoilers herein.

This is Svankmejer's most celebrated work, at least on IMDB. It is brief compared to the more visually rich 'Alice.' And the craft is high. It is short enough to avoid the tedium of his other projects,

Its appeal is that the artist is able to avoid his tendency to make sophomoric statements under the rubric of 'surrealism.'

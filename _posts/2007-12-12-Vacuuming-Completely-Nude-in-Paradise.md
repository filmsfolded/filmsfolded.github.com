Well.

Danny Boyle is sort of unpredictable, isn't he? He produced one of the best film experiences of my life in "Sunshine," something that bests Tarkovsky. Even Soderbergh failed at this.

And there have been other pleasant and mildly amusing adventures along the way. It seems that he wants to stretch in all sorts of directions. With "Sunshine" he worked with surrounding space. With Trainspotting surrounding emotions. With "Millions" the emotions we surround the film with. Here, its a traditional model, what some folks would consider a deep character study.

Its loud and uninteresting, detached and abstract. My take on these things is that you pay dues along with the filmmaker as he explores different stuff. How else to master this art?

There's a ton of exploration in how to manage the digital camera here. Interesting, personal spins and energetic editing. Otherwise? Pass.

This is a strange mix. The overall scope is that of your typical British miniseries based on a pulp novel. You know the kind that borders on romance fiction but focuses on the travails of a woman. The style of the photography and especially the score is derived from that cheap romanticism.

But the story. Its probably as cheap and trite to a Japanese viewer, but it engaged me in spite of the hammy performances. Its about writing, and love and revolution, but always writing first.

Our central character is a writer, a rather lovely woman whose poetry we hear a bit. Its even more lovely. But writing is about controlled tightening and in most of us that means love. This woman doesn't seek love, but it does come. And it does work. And it is dangerously passionate and produces danger in those she knows. 

Meanwhile, there are authorities and nature, both of which conspire against each other and written passion. The ending, I'm afraid is far weaker than the rest of it, with the very best part in the third of four acts. 

Its pretentious and overblown, but the story resonated with me.

I love mysteries from the thirties. It isn't because they are good movies, they aren't usually. It is because you can see history being made. 

Whatever we have now in terms of a cinematic narrative, the on screen avatar detective conventions were highly unsettled before "Kane." Here we have one of the more extraordinary experiments. In the thirties, spiritualism was still vital. Ghosts would speak. There were a number of attempts to relate the ghost we become when we watch action from a distance, to some sort of on screen ghost-mediator representative.

Here we have a Jane Marple type, played by a famous theatrical actress. She is a medium, brought in to solve a murder by going into a trance. The actual mystery is not well woven here, but that is beside the point. The way it is reported is what is interesting. She has a contact on the other side called "little eyes." (I'm not making this up.) In the middle of a séance, Little Eyes is about to reveal the name of the murderer when the querent is killed (stabbed) and the session ends. It was dark; everyone was holding hands; the room was locked; a thorough search found no knife; the medium had been tied to a chair.

An inspector is called, and he enters into a standard inspector/Miss Marple mode, where she solves the mystery by once again doing a séance, this time with the corpse in a chair. 

History, folks. These things are the anthropology of our imagination.

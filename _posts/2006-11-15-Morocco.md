I suppose I'll find a Deitrich movie to like eventually. I've just started surveying her.

This one has cheap sets, poor sound, wooden acting and a miraculously simple-minded story.

Deitrich is all about the ambisexual adventure, the exotic allure of practiced indifference. The coolness of the confidence of aloof loneliness. But here in her first Hollywood picture, she is made up less oddly than in the past -- and I think in the future. This does have a particularly strong and much referenced night club performance. 

Its the one with her in male formal attire and solid nonchalance in the face of a jeering crowd. It ends with her kissing a woman in the crowd, a kiss she fought with censors to leave in. It has her poise, but her face is oddly womanish, not like you remember. Still, you can get a lot of value out of this movie if you just watch that one scene and read the following summary, which is more powerful in the reading than the seeing.

Jolly comes to Morocco with nothing; we learn only that she has had some terrible past. She becomes a bit hit at a cabaret, seedy but the best in town. She falls in love with a randy loser from the French Foreign Legion. Meanwhile, a rich European bachelor, a painter has fallen in love with her and offers to marry. The legionnaire gives her up for her own good and is sent afar into danger. She agrees to marry the painter.

Eventually, she hears her true love is hurt and she goes to him. Her painter, who loves her follows, seeking only her happiness. As her legionnaire goes off into the desert with his command, she in bare feet joins the Arab camp followers without a care, following love.

Unfortunately, the drama as presented is dull stuff. Dull. Dull, even for the time. I put this in my category of films that suffer because the filmmaker is sleeping with the star. The only value is in that scene where we watch her watching the audience, us.

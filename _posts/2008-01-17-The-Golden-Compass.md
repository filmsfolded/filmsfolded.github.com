There's a class of films that center themselves not on any of the ordinary qualities, but on the cosmology of the world depicted. I saw this with "Siberiade" which has a quite complex set of warring internal cosmologies. It was often cinematically rich, grand and pure. Many so-called science fiction films like "The Matrix" and "Constantine" for example are hardly about the story or characters. They are there only to reveal the workings of the world, and it is that we find both fascinating and cinematically attractive.

One can never make one of these without touching religion in some way. I believe that films are where society works out some of its most sophisticated abstract reasoning experiments, and reinventing "religious" fundamentals are at the center of many of these experiments. 

So it is with some trepidation when you enter a project who does so overtly and deliberately. The most offensive of course are movies motivated by some sort of missionary zeal and where the film itself because part of a battle with the devil. That execrable "Narnia" film was of this type. If you have heard the owner of the material (some relative of Lewis) speak of the film, you will hear about the very same battles with darkness the thing illustrates. In some films that is quaint and curious. In 'Narnia" it offends.

Now we have a contender on the "other" side, one clever enough to split the matter of religion into two bits. One has to do with the institution of the church, hardly justifiable in any context and demonstrably a problem. The other has to do with the wonders of how the world is put together. This excels I think on both scores.

The producers were wimps when it comes to going head to head with religious zealots, so watered down all the antichurch bits. That's fine with me except for the existence of such fear. That element of the story wasn't central in any case. Its the alternative cosmology that matters, and its pretty clever. Its more clever than "Star Wars" and the "Matrix" films, though with fewer inherently cinematic attributes.

Nonetheless, it worked for me. That's in spite of the fact that nothing in the method of presentation was risky. The camera, the score, the acting were ordinary. The business about an ordained child that will save us is trite and bit counterproductive, until we get to the bits about sex and dust being the energy and tension of the universe. Parents denied and at war.

There's an odd symmetry. Watch "Narnia" for a wonderful actress playing the devilish bad mother well, and come here and see the churchly mother played poorly by a sometimes adequate actress. See the animals opposed. See dimensions that separate and those that join. 

See and participate in the war. 

It isn't Dune in its conception. We may never have a good film of that after two failures. But it is of the same ilk, and we need more of that.

Its not war, its defense. But it seems real in the US. Films and ideas matter. Commitments to imagination matter. With a little work, this could too. Let's hope for a better director for the next chapter.

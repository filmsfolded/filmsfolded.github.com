Spoilers herein.

This has some of the best fireworks on film, but the locations were otherwise not well exploited. The writing is shockingly trite.

Obviously, the element of interest here is Brando. Here is the man who reinvented film acting, who literally influenced how we dream. But he was notoriously lazy when working with an unintelligent director. And so we have in this case: the distance between character and actor that Brando discovered is here turned into disinterest. The hidden passion he could create then hide was never created. Its a bust -- sayonara.

There is some minor interest in watching the Japanese women act like an Americanization of Japanese women. How odd, but not entirely out of place in a project that has Montalban as a master Kabuki!

The final affront is the bland framing of shots. Japanese essence can be found in the highly asymmetric, which is the only way that land should be photographed. Logan uses jarring western notions of balance and symmetry in every shot. I guess that places the film in exactly the same context as Logan places the obtuse General's wife.

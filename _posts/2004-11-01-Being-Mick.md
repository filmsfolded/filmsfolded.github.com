Spoilers herein.

I have such a long list of films to watch that there is often a long lag between the time it appears on the list and the actual watching. Then, part of the fun is figuring out why I was so excited about getting it.

My watching during this hour was largely occupied in wondering why I wanted to see this. Or actually, why anyone would want to see it. Even more, why Mick would allow us to see him as a dolt. I guess it was to promote his solo album.

The only thing I could imagine was that perhaps I thought it would illuminate his enigmatic failure with Kate Winslet. Now that would have been interesting, including just why this economist collects enigma machines. Kate makes a brief appearance as a daffy celeb.

It reminds me of a similar piece I saw about Paul McCartney which was equally unflattering. But at least in Paul's case, the music - some of it - is accomplished and important.

There isn't anything more pure than a good science fiction story or movie. Its just the thing, you know, for good storytelling. 

That's because it is explicitly abstract and we have learned how to accept the abstractions, to scurry the goofy elements into hidy holes, just like we do when seeing romantic movies. That allows the filmmaker greater latitude to impose cinematic expressions, or to bend the story to those streams which exploit the visual imagination.

That's why I think Star Trek in all its incarnations is a beast that eats souls, that dulls the mind of whole generations. Its a curse, every element through and through excepting only the score. I saw this only because someone else dragged me to it, and I find it ever so much worse than I recall. That's only in part because the effects are extremely hokey by today's standards.

This is essentially a movie about two spaceships fighting, led by two men who pretend to be complex. Ahab and Lear are enlisted in the attempt to add weight to these characters. Its beside the point that the effects are ghastly, and the acting is among the worst ever seen.

Its because of how the thing was conceived, the decisions about abstractions that were made.

Those decisions were made in the sixties and to support a TeeVee show, about 40 minutes with 20 minutes of obnoxious ads. That means the characters are cartoons and the stories are so simpleminded and the moral so accessible that any dummy would "get it."

So we have simple morality plays in the TeeVee show that were grafted onto the chickenwire skeleton. Yes, they dealt with social injustice and should get credit for it. But they dealt with it in such a superficial buzzword brevity that we are now paying for it, with many folks thinking that life really is described in Spock parables. And we have the American political tradition based on similar simples parables.

That's carried over to the films, all of them. The fans would have it no other way, and even if they would have allowed some maturity or depth anywhere in the vicinity, you're still be stuck with the same actors, characters and "spaceship escapes" setup.

I watch a lot of 50's science fiction and marvel that we took much of it seriously at the time. All these Trek films have now moved into a similar zone of campiness.

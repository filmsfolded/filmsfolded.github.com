Spoilers herein.

I am amazed at how many writers have gotten on the bandwagon in writing films that in some way involve someone writing or manipulating reality. Almost always, there is some sort of a film within the film. And so it is here because this writer is an ordinary sort.

The manipulation in question is changing of records, so that reality is in effect changed. The triggering situation may have been an uncontrolled moment of passion, or it may have been a larger conspiracy. At the end, an even greater enveloping conspiracy is hinted. But never mind that, the game here is a common one, but in this case not intelligently woven.

The Â‘film' within in this case is a rather theatrical virtual reality interface to a centralized database. Pretty goofy.

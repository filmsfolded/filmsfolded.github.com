I enter all films through the same door: the same mind and eyes. But the filmmakers enter through different doors. Some just want to mine our need for old stories for lucre. Some want to create art, which I find it useful to think of in terms of new stories.

And some want to convince, sometimes through inspiration. These are the dangerous ones. They want us to come in with our old stories and leave with new ones. But unlike the case with real art, they have a goal in mind, a specific goal. 

This is why I am troubled by Pat Robertson's "Christian" film school. Its extremely well funded by mostly lower class donors hoping to buy themselves a place in heaven. Graduates come out ready to fight the devil by winning my soul. Advertisers want to convince as well, but the agenda there is acknowledged and we use different story- combating tools when they knock.

What to do with documentaries, though? The very idea is questionable. There is no such thing as honest journalism, not unless you have a commitment from the reader/viewer to actually weigh many stories. So we are confronted with a movie like this. Do we "like" it?

What does it mean to be "good?" That it convinces?

Michael Moore is getting good at this game. His target stories are less bizarre than in the 9-11 movie. It would have been enough to say that Bush and company were incompetent, superficial and panicked. But he went further with the notion that W was just in it for the bucks. This spun a stronger counter-story. If that film had not been made, Bush probably would not have been in a second term.

So here he sticks mostly to stories we already know. Obviously the health industry benefits from things not in the public interest. Obviously they got this privilege through bribery (or influence if you prefer). Yes, it is true that nearly every viewer has a health care horror story. Yes, we already know that every non-American city in a developed country has it better health care wise.

So what story is it that Moore needs to spin? What's the thing that he wants us to use to convince ourselves he isn't just a left-wing version of a big fat right wing entertainer?

Its the story that universal health care is close to what the American ideal is. Not that it makes sense in a vast battle between armies in Washington, but that it is next to why we all have a social compact, and what that compact is.

I admire this film. Its effective, but that's not why. I think in his past projects, He shot from the hip. He saw a wrong and wanted to get help -- to convince viewers -- to make it right. This time he has sought advice. This time he has real storymaking expertise. Sure, he rails on about bribery and greed, but only in so far as establishing his bonafides. 

I worry though. The fact is that we have HMOs in the US because the bad guys used this very technique in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ads against "socialized medicine." Okay, so the other side after twenty years is now as competent. Is that enough?

More precisely, is that enough to make this convincing film a worthwhile experience? Or just a social obligation?

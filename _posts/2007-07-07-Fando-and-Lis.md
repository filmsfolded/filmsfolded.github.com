I may be rewarded by his later films -- his later work is highly recommended -- but this one has no merit for me. I suppose everyone who comments on this should give some registration. For me Bunuel and Barney aren't worth it (except for a few brilliant sequences) while Greenaway and Madden are anchors for imaginative possibilities. 

This was his first film after an intensive career in alternative theater. He was in the self- described surreal and anarchy theatrical movements. They had a sort of power because the performers were physically there. If they smeared feces, the audience was involved in ways completely unreproducible in film. That sort of theater can be built on confrontation, negation, disorder alone.

I believe there is an analogue in film. Jack Smith perhaps. But at this point in his career, Jodorowsky didn't understand the difference and so far as he was concerned, commitment was enough.

Well, it ain't. Not for this viewer.

There's a porn film based on some of the more effective scenes here: "Through the Looking- glass." Its a superior film.

Spoilers herein.

How strange talent is. Even ordinary, old Greenaway is superior to most of what else one encounters.

This film employs all the Greenaway signatures minus one. Here we have moving water, casual nudity, numeric or alphabetical (here the latter) organization, and a Nyman score. Along the way, one gets a brief tour of a mildly naturalistic philosophy and some rather lovely images. What's missing is his usual esoteric symbolism within a mystical notion of order. This latter piece is what makes him a potentially lifealtering filmmaker.

Without that all one can do is charm, which this does.

Spoilers herein.

I'm an admirer of Mike Figgis. At least so far as the films that he invents. He is intelligent  and has the passion to takes risks into corners that others avoid. In 'Liebestraum' he  folded time into space (specifically an apartment store!). In 'TimeCode' he folded space  into time. 

But like Soderbergh, he seems to alternate his own adventures with movies that he does  for hire. In this case we have a disaster of sorts. It is that sturdy standard, a lesson about  a man who gives lessons with the first lesson presumably enforcing the latter. In this  case, a specific metaphor is introduced concerning emotional translation/transition, the  same idea used in a less literary way in 'Lost in Translation.'

But the whole thing is burdened. The producers apparently watered down the literary  metaphor until it is all but a shadow. There are some cross-issues about fidelity, but this  is to be carried by Scacchi - a pretty face who unduly presents herself with her breasts.  Not enough.

There's some faux leather in the score and one wonders how different this exact film  would be if he had done the score. He took a fairly mundane project with Nic Cage and  created a whole metacommentary with his score. Actually made Cage look good.

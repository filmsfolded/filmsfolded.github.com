Spoilers herein.

All movies are about other movies. Some movie comedies -- those that aren't just skits  with funny characters -- exploit movie stereotypes.

That's the game here and it is simple to read: Pesci as minor league goodfellow, with his  lowlife girlfriend both from New Joisie. Alabama as the intolerant, ignorant hicksville we  know, also from movies.

Neither place exists, in fact to extent that they do it is in people subconsciously  mimicking film.

What makes this project successful is that it is a gentle reference: each of the characters  only brushes with their stereotype, except for Tomei. She's given the room to play a  "real" (relatively real) character.

The result is a simple, relatively pleasant space-filler. The problem with these things is  that the current of film images is strong and deep. If you are not inventing, you are being  invented. This is not as harmless as it appears.

You can see the mechanics the screenwriter used: he needed a vehicle with traction that  would balance both sides without slipping. So that -- and the esoteric knowledge to  know that -- is what the plot turns on.

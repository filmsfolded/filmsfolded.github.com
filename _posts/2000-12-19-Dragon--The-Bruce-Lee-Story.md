The main driver in building cultures (including religions) is the establishment of archetypes. Over a very long time a south Asian ethic of martial arts emerged, and like most really strong memes, this one is supported by an overemphasis on the master. It is a complex notion: peace embodied in the potential for violence, akin to the western notion of the master magician who has the ability to shape the world only because he does not use that power. But it is all wrapped up in human icons as archetypes and so far as popular culture goes: stereotypes.

Every once in a while someone successfully makes a new entry into the film vocabulary. Bruce Lee's fame was that he did so, adding a layer of film type, stereotype and cliche that has since run exceedingly far and wide. As film is a key driver in culture, the two levels of film and 'real' life reinforce each other. So Bruce Lee is important -- he's changed both my film and my real worlds.

Now we add another, self-referential layer, a film about how Lee transformed film and hence life. It has a cool internal dynamic: he broke the martial arts code (of internalization, of secrecy) by using the magician's power to change the world, and presumably suffering a faustian penalty for it. What possibilities this has as a story and for powerful, intelligent cinema! What tripe resulted! This could have been terrific, especially since the lead was suitably graceful and his wife suitably dumb, and dumber. Instead we get the sort of facile glorification we expect from acolytes. 

Maybe later.

Spoilers herein.

David Lean makes pictures about the clash of civilizations, usually involving that old  bugaboo the British Empire. These are interesting enough.

But his films themselves are part of a clash within the filmmaking world. That's what  makes them seem fresh.

Much of the film world isn't interested in 'films' at all. They consider themselves  moviemakers; movies are about stories; stories are about characters; characters are what  actors bring to the project. So movies to them means actors, and of course that feeds the  machine that creates celebrities. There's plenty of reward for this product, even to the  point of the movie making money regardless of how bad, if it has a celebrity anchor.  Even away from the dark side of Mel and Julia and Harrison, there is a group of serious  actors who are seriously committed to this notion of actor-driven storytelling.

And then there's people like Lean who believe that the story is in the ether of the place.  Who evoke images through which characters traverse. Who boss the actors around as if  they were speaking shrubbery. Its great. The only problem is that while he is looking in  the right direction for greatness, he's just not very smart, or artistic or adventurous or  some combination of all three. 'Lawrence' is one of the best films ever made. That's  partly because he was forbidden to edit it, and a conspiracy was formed between  cinematographer Young and editor Coates to enhance the vision beyond where Lean  would have.

You can see the other end of that here, where he is working with a lesser man behind the  camera and once again doing the editing himself. The result is still admirable in its focus  on the place and how that place affects its own destiny. But beyond that, there's nothing  interesting here. Its quite like 'The Last Emperor' (as long as we're talking about  O'Toole), it gets our attention with a whack and then says nothing.

Everything seems contrived. The low point for me was near the beginning as Adela  Quested (what a marvelous series of sounds!) is in the train on the way to the place of  her fate.

The train goes over a bridge, under which are a collection of sorrowful souls. But we  know they are not there because they are there, we sense they are there because we  need to see them. They didn't grow out of the place naturally, but have the unnatural  artifice of the stage. A sorrowful end to the man who led O'Toole into the desert, and a  weak end to one of the champions of the most interesting branch of cinema.

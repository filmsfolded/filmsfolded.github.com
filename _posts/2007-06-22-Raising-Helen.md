Three sisters, played by two real actresses and one Hollywood daughter. One dies, one is overly stuffy and the third -- who inherits the children -- has the Devil-in-Prada life. Its the third sister the movie focuses on, but its Joan Cusack that steals this. She's the "unfun" sister.

Joan acts with her face to an extent that with anyone else, Jim Carey for instance, would only be comical. But she makes it real, as if she is a real character with someone inside pulling strings violently. But she shows us on the side that she (the actress) really does have this all under control. We don't have many actresses that can underdo overdoing it and make it work without having the whole project be invented around her.

She's really wonderful. I'm trying to find the film she wrote: "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez."

As for the movie: brand name fast food.

It is easy to see why this screenplay created a buzz in Hollywood. Movies today are all about other movies. Tarantino references nothing but. He isn't the inventor of this, but he did bring it to a new level of self-aware irony.

So its something when a script comes along from a fellow who knows nothing about other films. This is more a sketch for a clever book. But then he applies the same veneer as Ritchie and Tarrantino and the 'Go' guy. It is a reverse irony, a selfconscious goof on their own selfconsciousness. To make it obvious, he has our hapless murderers deliberately act like they were in a movie, often arguing about it 'Bronson always takes a rope.'

He directs, and the results aren't pretty. He muffs all the effects he is quoting, but that is so entirely apt, so entirely what he is all about (without knowing it) it works.

The key role here is played by Dafoe, who knows something about reverse self-reference. He played a key role in one of the earliest reverse self-referential projects 'eXistenZ,' and more recently in the very best, the gold standard: 'Shadow of the Vampire' a film about a film about filming vampires where the top level has the vampire as real. He knows what to do and since the director is weak, he does what he wants.

His character is the cross between the detective who is trying to discover the story and the avatar for the director who is writing the story. There's a rather nice scene where he is anachronistically in the action, narrating it -- and getting it wrong.

I'll take one of these over twelve McMullen brothers any day.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- has some interesting elements

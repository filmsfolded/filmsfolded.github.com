Spoilers herein.

Invented realities, constructed memories. That's what concerns Sayles. Storytelling through film is all about constructing realities around memories in the community. Sayles is a master film storyteller and intelligent as well. The result is a story that contains its own philosophy about storytelling. 

Part of this is too obvious to mention: memories built around deeds and following laws of nature. Communities defining themselves in terms of constructed myths, myths which provide the skeletons for recall. New entrants in the community redefining themselves to internalize the myths. Some of this is wonderfully subtle: note how Sayles folds time by simple pans. 

Some of this is just attention to the writing: mirrors of fatherhood -- a men discovering their boys, sons discovering their fathers. History as tradition in the military, in the community, in the family. The barriers emplaced to prevent wandering from the strictures of concretized memory. The bribes to suppress new history; the threats to the lone star as he plows ahead.

I consider 'Limbo' to be a more masterful and affecting film because it is less introspective. But this is pretty powerful and intelligent stuff.

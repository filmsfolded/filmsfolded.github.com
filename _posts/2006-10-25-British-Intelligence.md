This is actually quite good.

The setup is easy to describe, you have several spies, two in particular. There's a sort of mystery about where their allegiance lies.

Its a simple idea, but done well, because this was a long-running play, so had the time work out the dramatic and narrative effects, much more attention than the normal script would have.

Its Germans as the bad guys, of course, evil just dripping in the way that it only could between the great German wars.

I like this because of the way it co-opts the detective form. The viewer is drawn in. Clearly there are bad guys and good ones, but you don't know which is which -- who to cheer for -- until the end. You're drawn in as a sort of virtual detective.

Everyone is watching everyone else. Its the motive and roles you must learn.

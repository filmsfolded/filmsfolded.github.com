The movie musical by this time was already breathing its last. Perhaps all genres go through a life cycle and eventually fade away, or so most observers believe. But I think there was a more fundamental shift at work, a shift in how we see film stories. Musicals demand that we enter a work that wavers between reality (in the story) and a stylized non-reality where a song-and-dance theatrical entertainment is presented. Since the 60s, we've been unwilling to shift realities without one of the explicit conventions that have evolved, some quite sophisticated.

They tried something like one of these conventions by having an onstage "band" whenever Christmas and gang appeared.

But there are other interesting things about this project. First, that it really is rooted in reality, more so than others of its ilk. At least Molly Brown did live, and her life was roughly as depicted. Second, there was another fold with reality: a celebrity scandal involving the "good" Debbie and the "bad" Liz, with Debbie fighting back (as a pudgy 32 year old).

But there's another level that is lost today. The 60's in particular and the decades before as well were periods when the American social conscience was in a "populist" camp. Movies and books reflected this: the rich were either evil, or selfish, or blind or simply stupid while the real wisdom and joy and meaning of America was found in its "ordinary" people.

Many were the dramas that reduced things as they are here: genuine but rough, simple people contrasted with the stodgy, sober unimaginative rich. That was before the American scene shifted. Most people now consider themselves middle class and don't mind being a bit pretentious consumption-wise. What was "simple" and "genuine" has been co-opted by their commercial abstractions in various worlds ("country" and "hiphop" for example).

The model for "Molly" has now shifted to the explicitly dumb but well-intentioned and pure- hearted as in "Legally Blond."

Once again, we have a Technicolor redheaded heroine. She's no Charisse and danced with a loping wide athletic stance that Gene Kelly would famously criticize.

Walt Disney had vision and a grand horizon, but no one ever credited him with genius in the drawing and animation department. His early successes were due to this guy. Ub Iwerks. His 1929 "Skeleton Dance" was probably the first great animated film -- clever in so many ways.

Creative differences drove him away from Disney where he had his own shop for a while. But lacking the promotion skills of Disney, he floundered. Eventually he was to come back to Disney, Inc.

But in the last throes of his independence, he remade "Skeleton Dance" in color and with some new effects he had invented. You need to see the two together, especially if you are a student of special effects in films.

This seemed a bit sad: it referenced a work of art so original for its time it seemed pale by comparison and taking into account all the progress made since by others.

Yet, it is nice and clever and important.

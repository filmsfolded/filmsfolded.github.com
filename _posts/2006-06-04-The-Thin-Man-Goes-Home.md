You have to put this into perspective, by that I mean the perspective of film. Movies are a great invention and the definition of genres more or less was driven by Hollywood. The thirties was the great emergence, and "The Thin Man" was something that worked during this period, so affected much that followed. Perhaps that wasn't such a good turn for those of us that want something more substantive, but that's for another comment.

The point is that the original was entertaining, even today. And significant. So they copied it a few times.

Then the world changed -- war -- and with it the world of movies. Also, the original director was dead and Hammett was burned out, disgraced and in the army anyway.

So they thought the franchise was flexible enough after a decade to bend to the times. Nick becomes sober and Nora becomes a ditz. The setting is changed from the seamy city to the America heartland with the murder revolving around some stupid espionage racket. Distributed throughout are all sorts of heartwarming references to the sacrifices people are making.

In the process, they made a stinker of a movie. All in all, I suppose it isn't much worse than others of the period, but to be so high and fall so low, even with the sexy girl that is a parody of "intellectual" drama.

How sad.

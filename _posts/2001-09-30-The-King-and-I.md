Spoilers herein.

There are some deadly flaws here. Except for Yul, the acting is dreadful, with perhaps history's worst child actor performance in Rex Thompson (Louie). The songs are uninspired or worse. There's some rather heavy racial insensitivity and a rather dumb 'siamese twin' joke.

Anna's dresses are very nice, especially when she dances and sits on the floor. Some cinemascope shots are really quite good.

But there are only two reasons for seeing this film. One of them is Yul. Its a performance that captures really well three layers: a theatrical actor who plays large: playing a character; who is playing the role of King (who also is playing large, but in a different way); who incidentally sometimes plays a European. Yul's career outside of King is lackluster, so here's an example of a narrow talent finding just the right vehicle. (Lots of examples but for some reason Sean Young in Bladerunner comes to mind.)

The other reason is the marvelous play within a play. Other than the trampling on political correctness (no small matter), it is a real gem. It is placed precisely the same distance from the story (in terms of theater and 'reality') as the presentation of the story to real life. I've watched just that part several times. It contains one of the best effects I have ever seen: the silk threads as rain.

Spoilers herein.

We all have different solvents with which we are able to assimilate the world into our beings. With film, most people take it as intended, as the engineers desire. Its in my own makeup to experience the wonder of the creative process in the project. Sometimes the content of the film acknowledges that creative juice in something I call folding. Rarely do I come across a project where the attraction of the engineered effect is as strong as the wonder about what happens behind the curtain. This film does that.

Here's the amazing thing: the script was written, the project turned on, the director, lead actor and location selected. The STYLE of the film was designed, after the fashion of 'The Bicycle Thief,' which exploits the innocent face in a then shockingly natural urban context. All of this was engineered for someone who could exploit the material with a childlike attitude in a graceful adult body. All this was done to prepare for Audrey Hepburn before they even knew she existed! So there are several types of magic here.

One type of magic is that she was able to inhabit the role. This can only be done naturally. There isn't much acting involved if you consider acting to be the craft of Streep, Moore, Blanchett. The DVD has some footage from the original screen test, where the camera surreptitiously filmed her after the test. She's precisely the same. The best part of this picture, the soul of it, is her natural reaction to the 'eaten hand' trick.

But the other type of magic is even more impressive: that the film industry - including technicians on both sides of the Atlantic - would all know exactly what type of film personality needed to be invented.

My interest is 'folding:' that's often where the contents of the movie say something about the way it is made. This business of truth or 'acting' is a matter of folding; compared to Peck Hepburn isn't acting. Compared to Joe, Anna's lies are trivial. The business about leaving a 'stage' and 'going urban' is folded as well, and that depends on the most common notion in this kind of folding: that the guy is writing a 'story' about what you see (usually of course a girl).

Audrey would of course become a princess of sorts, at least the diplomatic sort we see here. After her holiday with movies, she became (for a longer period) an important icon of UNICEF.

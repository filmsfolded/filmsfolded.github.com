Spoilers herein.

This is included as an extra on the 'The Southerner' DVD and is much the better experience. Both films represent a lost attitude in film. This one is worth re- experiencing: the Slow Burn flummox that was invented by this guy, continued in many radio series ('Guildersleeve' is the best), to be mastered in my experience by Ralph Kramden.

The setup is disposable, but the reactions are amazing. That's because we can see something that is now hackeyed when it was fresh.

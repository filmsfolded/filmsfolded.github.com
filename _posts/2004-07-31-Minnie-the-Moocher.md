Spoilers herein.

Spooky in three ways. The first is in the implied use of the derogatory for the black  performers. The second is in the bizarre story involving a visit to hell. Of all the strange Boop  adventures, this is perhaps the most disconcerting (together with 'Red Hot Mama') visits to  the demonic side. The more unsettling it becomes, the more you think about it. No Scooby  do here, this is real.

The third spookiness is in how the rotoscope imbues the ghost on the screen with the  personality and very subtle movements of the lively Cab, a man haunted by his own demons.

This was during the period that it was possible to have a character (in Betty) that superficially  looked and acted silly but conveyed deep and dangerous tides of sex. If these would have  been in color, she would be redheaded, like Clara Bow.

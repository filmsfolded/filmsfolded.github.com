Spoilers herein.

Bogdanovich is a blot on the script that is the story of filmmaking. He is not the only  disaster, and he did produce one watchable film ('Cat People'). But generally his projects are  exercises in copying others. Here he tries to copy what he - or his publicists - calls a  screwball comedy.

But each page is a colorless walking through of some dimly perceived act of genius. His  timing is offensively unnatural, and is hardly helped by the cast, some of the dreariest of the  period.

There is a good idea in the four identical cases. And another in the odd character that  Streisand was supposed to play. We've seen similar stuff from Buck Henry elsewhere. And yet  a third in the neurotic redwigged Madeline.

But all we get is a painful reminder that real comedy must be genuine, and that means it  really must be original. Copies may work on TeeVee because that is based on consistency of  product. But in the 'long form,' it actually hurts.

Spoilers herein.

It is possible to make a film that has a soul, is entirely coherent (a rare thing) and competent... and yet be uninteresting. No one doubts Lang's ability to create a whole vision, even successfully tell a story cinematic ally.

This one may have had some novelty when new, in terms of the actual story: cop's wife killed, revenge sought, powerful forces. So many better films (and worse) have rummaged through this. Though it has some theatrically drawn characters, and each part is connected to every other part, it doesn't connect to the viewer. It doesn't inhabit that space between it and us. It is merely a dated sculpture.

More interesting is why people call it noir - why Lang himself thought it was.

Noir has as a central notion the existence of a fate outside the control of the space we share with the author/narrator. Usually we know that we have no control because bad things happen, often things that have no apparent logic, things we spend time trying to fathom.

When you have the noir fate, you end up with inhuman camera angles and lighting, because the narrative stance is half in our world and half in that world of the unknown beyond. I saw this on a double bill with 'Kiss Me Deadly.' Now that's noir. So far as jilted clarity, this is a walk in the park.

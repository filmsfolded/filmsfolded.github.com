Spoilers herein.

You already know that the production values are poor and the artistic center of this is skewed. You already know that Connery (a vocal actor) and Gere (a dancer) just don't have the moxie to carry this. You probably already know that the power of this legend, refined over many, many generations was capriciously modified by Hollywood. One of the worst writing decisions I can imagine.

I was going to write about the defiled beauty of the legend first, but as I say, you already know that. What intrigues me is Ms Ormand. She is an intelligent actress, someone who understands and seeks out complex projects. She knows the Russian narrative spirit and has sought out several roles in that tradition. I count Smilla in that tradition -- the book was a clever study in shifting the narrative inside and out and infusing it into an environment,

Her first real film role was also her most marvelous: 'Baby of Macon.' That surely is one of the ten most narratively rich and ambiguous films ever made. She is the central character. But alas, her career was ruined by a cattle of Hollywood glamour managers who paraded her through one disaster after another: Tony Hopkins trying to be Pa Cartwright; Harrison Ford trying to be intelligently funny; and here struggling with Connery's stentorian sledgehammer.

In 'Baby of Macon,' she was serially raped. Same here.

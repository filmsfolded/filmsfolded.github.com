Spoilers herein.

There is art that is intelligent, and intelligent things that are artistic. When you try the  latter, you really have to be intelligent though. This film attempts that.

Unfortunately, it rests on banal insights and sophomoric ideas. This is not just a film  whose time has passed. I saw this when it was new and it was childishly naive and dim  then.

I have several Italian friends who have learned to live with the lack of political and  societal sophistication that has become embedded in the national consciousness. But  even they cringe when confronted with this. 

Yes, context matters. Yes, eroticism is essentially political. Yes, violence is cinematic. All  this in the story argues against the form of the film.

She should have known that few contexts of viewers would allow this to work. She should  have known that politics is not essentially erotic. She should have known that personal  violence and submission is thin stuff when it comes to weaving a truth.

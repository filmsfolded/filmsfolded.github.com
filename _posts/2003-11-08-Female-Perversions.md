Spoilers herein.

This is a very ambitious film. It attempts to merge the cool abstract perspective of Hal  Hartley with the visceral exploration of personal damage of Jane Campion. These two  seem contradictory and indeed are not successfully combined here.

But it has some very lovely and lasting images, enough so that the experience is  definitely worthwhile. The project actually seems to have been conceived around a few of  these set pieces, then loosely tied together with some narrative bits.

When people take chances like this, they deserve our attention. They deserve as much  risk in the watching as they took in the making. Not everyone believes in risky watching  - but if you do, you can trust Tilda. 

The idea here is that women are victims of the roles thrust upon them. Tilda is more  intelligent as an actress than is Streitfeld as a filmmaker so she is thrust into much the  same situation. Watch how she uses the latter to illuminate the former. This is not the  intended exploration of how woman misfit into society, instead concerns how they misfit  into the film imagination.

That's where the Hartley technique comes in. His films are about films, with lots of self  comment and layer shifting. Not all of this worked for me, but enough did.

The key failure is in balancing archetype and stereotype in presenting character icons.  Here, we have

Eve, who is unfairly reduced to a sexually confused parental reject

Maddie, her sister who gets a doctorate in her own pathology, emotional theft

Annunciata, a selfconstructed stripper/seducer

Renee, a reluctant bisexual psychiatrist

Langley, a character that only women will appreciate, the womaneating weasel

Emma, terminally hungry for love

Ed, hypnotized by her commanding womb

An Earth Mother

An absent mother

If this sounds like Greenaway's '8 1/2 Women' taxonomy, it is. You might go there for a  better purely abstract examination of this same notion of roles as prisons/perversions.

If you merely need the visceral, 'Ten Tiny Love Stories,' may be your station. The notion  of roles and fantasy layering is also in 'Heavenly Creatures,' and better.

Here's a delicious irony. Notice that the first three women on the list are redheads? I'm  convinced that one of the strongest automatic perceptions, one of the deepest,  hardwired presumptions about the female image is associated with red hair. Would have  been good to know if Streitfeld was an unwitting victim of this.

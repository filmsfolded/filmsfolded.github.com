You make few major choices in life... things so basic they transcend the ordinary obsessions about who we are and how we live. The basic choices have to do with how we approach such issues, how we structure the parts of the worlds we live in.

We have power over that, the world. You choose your world. Art is your best friend in this, both the potential art of yourself and certainly the art you choose to digest from others. And of these, both of these, cinema can have a place. For most of us, it must have a place. Indeed, for most of us, the grandest decisions we make about the world and ourselves are made without our knowledge through being seduced by what comes our way through movies.

But we do have a choice about this. Film has two main hemispheres in this regard and "Apocalypse" is a visit to the jungles of one.

What we have in Coppola is the tradition that the world revolves around people. People have lives, those lives move and in moving generate an electricity that powers the forces that surround us. More, the smell of us flavors those forces. Everything we know is the simple aggregation of these forces into grand rivers whose currents we can fight or surf. In cinema, this tradition is rooted in Italian artistic traditions, hence is represented by Italian Americans in Hollywood: Coppola, Scorsese and those that follow in their streams like Lucas. ("Star Wars" is simply "Godfather" with different sets.)

It can create powerful cinema, should you choose to relinquish your soul to it. That's because one strength of film is the ability to inflate a single actor with qualities that clarify this mechanism, that the world bends to humans, and human "motivations." Copolla's voyage, Kurtz's world, Brando's approach are what makes "Apocalypse" a sort of touchstone for this philosophy -- the absolute commitment to "discovery" with the tools of examining self. 

The other hemisphere of film cosmology is noir, the notion that the viewer and filmmaker collectively spin a world with dynamics apart from the mere humans therein. These incidentally get toyed with. The camera examines the world, not the beings though naturally the drama of those beings is always the focus. Noir is uniquely cinematic and equally powerful.

"Apocalypse" is a war movie from the one hemisphere where Kubrick and Malick chose the other. "Apocalypse" is a "Heart of Darkness" personal voyage by a filmmaker who folds his life into the enterprise, while "Fitzcarraldo" of about the same time is the complement. If it comes to choices -- as it always must -- I choose Herzog, Malick, Kubruck and the others.

Now we have a better option. This documentary is a view from one hemisphere about a man, events and a film in the other. Coppola's wife, his other half, gives us this view of a man buffeted by accident, a man who believes in insight and control but has neither for his film about struggles with the same. One world folded into the other.

Apart from being a fascinating story, this documentary gives us exactly what we need, the balance of looking from one world into the evil snappings of the other. If you need a character, the wife is the fascinating one here. All the others kick at the world as if they can sculpt it. Look at her closely and appreciate the other half that actually bears children, in her a thin, patient mage.

And now we have two of the skinny kids she has suckled (and we see here) as full filmmakers in their own rights. And we are presented with choices all over again. I choose Roman.

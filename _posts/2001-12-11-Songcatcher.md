Spoilers herein.

Frequently, a film is an example of the very thing the story is about. It happens twice here.

Folk songs are cartoonish soap operas, packed with people in tragic situations which they do not control. There is passion, but no soul in any character, no self-examination. And such it is here in spades:

-- a discovered lesbian love affair

-- a 'Lady Chattery' rut

-- a scheming academic adulterer

-- a robber coal mining baron and henceman

-- a philanderer who is skilled by a spurned lover

And gobs and gobs of ignorance, drunkeness and distrust. Also as with folk songs (and now, 'country' music), everything is intuitive; there is no 'conscious' art. In music, that can charm because music connects at a deep level, in fact a strong case can be made for 'art' getting in the way. Not so with film: primitiveness in this case is amateurishness.

The story is about not exploiting these people, and then does just that. Surely the filmmaker could have found a stance in that vast middle between overly romanticizing and patronizing, both or which are resorted to here.

Emmy Rossum is very appealing, but not enough to justify marking time with this.

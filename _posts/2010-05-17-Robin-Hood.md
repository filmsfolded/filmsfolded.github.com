Kubrick started his career as most of us do, without knowing his place in the art. Early in his career, he had an experience that told him what he wasn't: he was asked to direct "Sparticus," after the original director was fired. It is hard to imagine today, but big expensive movies like that were rare. It was a good job for him, lots of money. Supposedly lots of control. 

Some who went to see it were satisfied with it. It was loud where it was supposed to be. The theatrical machinery worked as planned. But for Kubrick it was a disaster; all the big decisions were made higher up. The actors were prima donnas. The intelligence behind the thing was blunt. Never again would he allow himself to be a director-for-hire.

Fifteen years later, he did compromise a bit. He wanted to do something big. At that point in his career, he couldn't attract the funding without losing control over important elements. (2001 had been seen as indulgent excess.) The story and key actor was set, both extraordinarily dumb.

No matter. Kubrick decided to work within the domains in which he had control. He created a continuous flow of visual masterpieces. He begins with the light -- captured by specially made lenses, light always found rather than being created. Flow of narrative, people, objects and eye follow. Framing follows that. The result is a landmark in cinema. Never mind that the story is turgid and the acting thin. Who cares?

Since then, a few directors have attempted this "Vermeer mode." Some, I have appreciated, especially when it supports other qualities well done.

Now this. The only major producer more disgustingly crass than Jerry Bruckheimer is Brian Grazer. He insists on story as he sees it, thinking it to be the stuff that matters. Around that he similarly insists that colored clouds be attached just because it seems to sell tickets. Ridley has no compunction about being a director-for-hire. He's made some real dogs in this role: think "Hannibal." Think "Black Rain."

But he is a fine man, capable of good art. So here, instead of pulling a "Sparticus," he pulls a "Barry Lyndon." 

This script was one of those that was bad from the beginning and got worse as time went on. But the juggernaut had begun and you start filming while script doctors of various dimension are brought in. Finally the master, Tom Stoppard is able to snip around the edges, but otherwise we have fine actors stumbling about in a void: no center, no script, greenscreen environment. 

No matter, Ridley is busy sculpting the light. Unlike others, he does not find Kubrick's lenses and play with the optics. It is all done in post-production. But I must say it is a treat to see what he did. He was unable to play with the rhythms of the physical motion like Kubrick could. But he WAS able to do something nearly as ambitious: the inside/outside light equivalences -- and the far shot, near shot equivalences. 

I do not yet know the technology that was used to do this. It is beyond what Kubrick could do practically. Where Kubrick was limited to the textures he sees, Scott has ADDED or enhanced texture. Many objects of course are wholly artificial. The sum is pretty incredible: Grazers train wreck presented with sublime, curious, hungry light.

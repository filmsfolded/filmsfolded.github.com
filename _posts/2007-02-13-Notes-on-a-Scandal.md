In previous comments, I have railed about Judi Dench, how she tries to bend the environment of the project to suit what she wants to do. Instead of understanding the requirements of the narrative and supporting it -- and every worthwhile project will have some special notions here -- she just plows ahead. Its perhaps a side effect of that quaint but repellent system of English titles. If you somehow comport yourself to fit the national story, you get a title and everyone henceforth provides a verbal curtsy.

Its tolerable enough in faux aristocratic bankers, and even non-actor celebrities. But actors are different members of society than anyone else. When they reach a level of familiarity, they can if they choose, form part of the story that we might choose to join. So I have been upset that Dench ruins movies because she is filling the role not required by the movie, but by an anachronistic class system. 

And my most discouraging experience was with this very same director. She shared a role with Kate Winslet, Kate the young and Judi the old version. The whole point of the thing was how each was nested -- or could be -- in the other. Kate is fully capable of this; why she was chosen, but she has no partner. The thing was a disaster.

But here, Dench surprises. Perhaps it is because she actually appears together with her collaborator, someone every bit as capable as Kate. And the setup here is simpler: these are complements of each other, not versions of the same being. It works, at least so far as what the actors can do, and for that I am thankful.

The film as a whole fails, despite what we have in terms of the way the actors place themselves with each other. It fails because the director doesn't know how to allow them to place themselves in relation to us. I invite the reader to view a project that has Dench, is constructed the same way, but works. Its called "Langrish Goes Down." It also has a narrative wrapper in a diary of sorts, but there the diary (actually letters to no one) takes on its own agency and you have no idea how much of what you see is imagined or not. Dench there is perfect, just a miracle, and the film does what it is supposed to -- it makes us unsettled in what we maintain as love outside.

Here, all you can do is allow the narrative and diary to be set up off to the side, not as our world, but as a sort of prop to let us know that this woman is a predator. Also it appears at the end as a plot device. Sure, there are some flashy moments. Sure we get to see Cate, and there is some resonance in having her energy wasted in playing a character whose energy is wasted. But except for the fact that we get to see Dench actually try, its a waste.

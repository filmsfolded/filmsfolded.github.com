Movies are like any other art. There are movies for any age that tease the mind, expand the cognitive arena, are when all is said: art. A parent owes it to a child to expose them to art, even if the child has fun.

Then there amusements derived from art, imitations that do not have these qualities. They occupy, often pleasantly. But there is no middle ground with children, if you are not allowing them to grow through art, you are forcing them to shrink.

This little collection of ditties is not art. "The Muppet Movie" is. Any Pixar project is. This isn't.

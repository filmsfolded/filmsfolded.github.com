Spoilers herein.

The Thin Man was a milestone of sorts in both literature and film. Until that point, the detective story relied on first the world of logic, then deceit, the science of detection and then interesting characters and situations. The Thin Man turned this on its head by building characters first, and working in the logic of unraveling as a second concern.

This completely changed the genre.

But even they couldn't sustain it after the first blast of cool characters. This last installment tries to salvage the series by going back to the roots of the genre, by putting the story first. And because we tired of the old characters we have two character diversions: caricatures of jazz musicians, and some very sexy women. Those latter really stand out because the main male suspects sort of all look the same: same build, hair suits, height.

I'm beginning to think the guys are running out of ideas. 

This script appears to be novel, original, and it is so far as the story itself. But the mechanics are getting worn, if you follow what they do.

They are students of noir, the elaborate kind where ordinary people get caught up in circumstances that are driven by page mechanisms and where the story explicitly acknowledges that their suffering is caused by our watching. 

Here, the emphasis is on the watching. The Russians watch. The CIA watches. Lawyers watch. We watch. Down in the world (other than what we manipulate) all that happens is that people screw.

Brad Pitt once again shows that he has the stuff to inhabit more bodies than we expect.

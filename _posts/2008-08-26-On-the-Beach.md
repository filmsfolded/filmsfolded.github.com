I never saw this until recently, despite its supposedly sexy allure.

I came to it because of its Australian connection, and discovered that it was intended to be deep by mining deep fears. In that, it is similar to "The Day the Earth Stood Still," which I recently saw. That was unfortunate because I nearly applied the same reaction to this. That was so dependent on the fears of the time that it really has no effect today. None at all. I can tell you that those fears were real, visceral and for some among us, prominent enough to shape lives.

This is different because like many films, it imposes great "political" events on personal lives. And it digs into those lives like few other Hollywood pictures of the era. You trace three stories. One is of a young couple with an infant. Another is of a scientist, now a drunk who is incapable of a relationship. And then you have the foreground situation of the main couple. 

Its a pretty complicated situation they portray. Unfortunately they are poor actors. But it still comes across: hunger.

Browsing through the comments, one would think that love has something to do with the urges here, the tensions. No, its about the urge for home. All the personal stories are about home, and the tragic end has our sailors -- doomed and knowing it -- deciding to head for home to die. Our captain is on board, not because he cares about the destination, but because his duty is as the father of the floating castle.

Events occur throughout that initially seem odd, but that register through this lens.

So it works in a sort of clinical way. You can see all the urges as if the wires were made visible. But because we do not fear the specific threat this depends on, we lose the blood of the pull.

We stay in Melbourne.

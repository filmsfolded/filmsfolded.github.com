In its day, this little film was considered powerful because it dealt with matters of sex. Essentially all of the shock value is gone now.

There's a story, which I won't mention. It hardly matters except for setting up a situation where no one really knows what they want in relationships. But massive commitment goes into the striving.

What this has going for it today are three things.

One is the performance of the jilted woman, who serves as our on-screen observer because she seems to understand more than anyone else. Part of the wonder of this is how interestingly her part is written. She seems to have a perspective others do not. But of course, this is false, and presented as merely her "French" manner. At the time, before the French new wave, this would have registered. The interplay of how much she cares and how much she seems to is at the root of the drama. She won an Oscar for her Frenchness.

A second element of the structure is how this self-observation is annotated in the thing. Its all about how we see what our love and urges are about (and how we see THEM). So we have a folded narrative in an amateur theater company in the film. Though not much is overtly made of this, its where the tone of playing and observation are introduced, and our place in what we see. A token from this continues throughout the film in a friend of Simone's character who watches and judges.

While the effectiveness of those two devices has faded with time, the final element of this is much sharper. Its the depiction of the two English cities as incredibly dirty, messy, derelict. Freddie Francis's eye has been used by several director's to emphasize the importance of context. Lynch actually built an entire film (Straight Story) around him. What the man has done here is find enough incidental glimpses of cities that barely exist, to convey the need to escape that drives our main character.

It works. It all works.

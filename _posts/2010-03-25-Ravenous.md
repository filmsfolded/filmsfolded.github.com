Its a great little concept: obsessive passion as cannibalism. 

One can experience the resistance against the addiction from the other side. Usually we see sex, as say in "Realm of the Senses," and experience the pull because the very watching pulls. Here, with only a slight shift -- a very slight shift -- we experience the visceral push in the revulsion of eating flesh.

The ability to posit that men inherit the strength and some supernatural powers from those they eat allows the filmmaker to stage brutal fights that make sense. The characters are intensely drawn but using theatrical devices rather than comic book ones, as we have post- Quenten.

The thing that makes this for me is the appearance of Pearce and what we know of him from other projects. We allow this more in this film than in others because the physical setup is folks coming from one "camp" to another remote one. This was right before his Leonard of Memento, which for any cinephile is a touchstone, like the ceiling in Marienbad.

And it was after his Felicia in Priscilla, something that reminds us that Australian actors know the internal truth of the ruggedness of the land.

Oh, and there is a connection to Marienbad in a way. The score here (in the last half) is what drives this movie. It has to rank as one of the most apt and powerful I know. The composer is Nyman, a sort of Glass but centered in the human rather than the abstract. There is a techno-Gregorian balance here that grabs the part of the soul that moves us forward, but grabs in a way that suggests ghostly presence. The Nyman-Greenaway connection is unavoidable, despite their more recent falling out.

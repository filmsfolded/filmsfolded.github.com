Spoilers herein.

This just didn't do it for me when it was new. And it still doesn't. Yes, I know that he did  better, and the trilogy inspired a sub genre. Yes, I know that it is remarkable that he  pulled this off. But all it has is the sketch of a notion toward panicked containment, and a  little irony at the end.

Ho hum. 'Carnival of Souls' was much more original and creepy. I think the later versions  don't make the mistake of 'explaining' why the dead are arising. Any scifi film that  depends on long sequences where a 'scientist' explains things is a sure loser.

Spoilers herein.

This is one of the most interesting problems I've seen recently. Why is this film so bad?

I don't think it is the story: we gladly tolerate such vapid stuff all the time. The acting and writing is bad, but normally so. I think where this fell apart is in the editing. Pretty sure there. There's enough motion in the shooting, after all this is the 'Die Hard' guy, the guy that invented the action film. I'll bet we see a book about how the editing on this was screwed.

(The 'film within,' a steady convention, is here the characters as actors in a new performance art.)

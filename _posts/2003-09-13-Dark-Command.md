Spoilers herein.

John Wayne ruined the western for me. The whole idea of the western until Leone was in  constant repetition, walking the same route every time so that subtleties could be  emphasized. Since everything else was given, we could focus on the smallest things.

Real art in moviemaking is in picking the right things. Real art in moviewatching is  recognizing and working with those smallest things. At just this time, John Ford  counseled Wayne in developing his random cadence: a few words, then a pause in an  unexpected spot before continuing.

It first appeared in 'Stagecoach.' It was used in place of interesting subtleties and was  remarkably successful - so much so that all news announcers employ it to make their  reading sound interesting. News is now a bad western.

This film is the last where John Wayne tried real acting, the kind that uses real language  patterns.

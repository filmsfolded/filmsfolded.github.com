Spoilers herein.

Warning, if you watch this on DVD, avoid the commentary at all costs. This is a case  where the creators are inarticulate nitwits, but what they have created has a particularly  intelligent design.

Superficially, this is the simple formula: boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy gets girl back.  With this edition, the two leads - and particularly the girl - are more honest and  nuanced than usual. Zooey is the daughter of one of the industry's best infill  cinematographer. These are the equivalent of session players who know how to fill all the  holes in an ordinary song to give it the illusions of fullness and complexity. (For instance,  he kept Mel Gibson's controversial, smarmy redaction from looking bad.)

Green is a student of this technique. What we have is a film in which the story is the  background. The foreground is a series of wonderful compositions with cinematic power.  Apparently, these were intuitively derived. The one that really impressed me was a  bowling alley scene where Zooey stands in the middle of the alley with her back to Paul  and he dances in the same fashion we saw him do in a clown suit with his similarly  redheaded mother. Compare that to the bowling alley scene in "Buffalo 66."

It is worth watching for that scene alone, though there are several others. And Zooey  impresses.

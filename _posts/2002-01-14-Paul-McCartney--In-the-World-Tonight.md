Spoilers herein.

Paul's fans know an unsettling truth which is/was also true of John and George: their music is far more intelligent and engaging than they are. That's because the music is highly intuitive, even channeled, in Paul's case still via hallucinogens. But as a person, he's rather a selfish guy capable of only vacuous smalltalk.

That's why these films are strange. The music is transcendent, sometimes visceral. Even the light stuff wriggles deep into your conversations with yourself. He just doesn't get it though -- never has -- that this is apart from his life. And that's by his design. He knows how to place a tune in that space where we help complete it, but he has kept his life out of that stadium.

All this is to say that it is a far, far richer experience to turn out the lights and listen to his music CD in silence with someone you love than to try and make something worthwhile from these images.

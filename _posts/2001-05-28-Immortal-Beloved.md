Spoilers herein.

There are several episodes in this bio where LvB is absolutely oblivious to what the orchestra or his own piano is doing, yet he sometimes gets through by going through expert motions.

Some of that metaphor holds for this film if you take away the elements that LvB was a genius and that he was performing works he knew. This is not a work of genius, instead a very expert construction using the standard filmmaker's playbook.

It has the by now canonical Wellesian construction. It contains lush photography, some lovely women, passion, the passionate music leading through a maze of lust. It contains a great actor.

But that photography has neither style nor passion itself. It mistakes passion in music for some sort of soap operaish angst -- it in fact employs the cinematic device of showing the depth of music through the mooneyed swooning of superficial women. 

Alas, this joins other examples where films about other arts somehow forget about the soul of those arts. So we have films about writing, dance, music, math, chess which have nothing to do with the essence of those things. ter Seege was in Altman's van Gogh which DID understand painting and was itself painterly. This film has music in it, but it is most unmusical. Rather like a wellmade musicbox.

And then we have Oldman. Oldman himself is a passionate performer, but we end up watching Oldman's passion and not Ludwig's. This is an oversight of a weak director I think, but only could have been avoided in the casting. Oldman has such flourish, such flash in his work that he can only effectively play characters who are performers themselves, like the smarmy republican in 'Contender.'

So what we end up with is a crisp confection, with no soul. I suppose people who like music (but don't understand the danger of real music) will probably like it. Try 'Hilary and Jackie' for a mainstream film about music, which does have soul, where all the acting is invested in the characters not the applause, where the story is actually more true, and where the passion of music is shown more aptly.

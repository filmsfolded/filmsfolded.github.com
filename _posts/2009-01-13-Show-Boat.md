Wow, there is so much in this to get upset about.

You know, that it has one memorable song, presented so profoundly well that by itself it could have been the first successful music video. But it stands apart from everything else in this lurid mistake.

Even if it had been a good film, viewers would tinge from the handling of race. Its so alien now that its even puzzling as to what the story actually is -- so far from that world we've come.

Here's the setup: we have four worlds. One is the world of the performer. Its a rich, rewarding happy world, one that you can always retreat to. Its a work of "make-believe" which is truer than true. Because all of the performer's songs are tepid, this is anchored by the dancing Champions. They are terrific, sexy, full.

A second is the world of gambling. All people are gamblers to some extent in this movie, but there is a specific, closed gambling space and populace. These people are performers of sorts.

The third world is the world of the viewers. They are arrayed up and down Huck Finn's river, and are eager, passive and barely human. We are folded into this class: tepid, lifeless humans.

The fourth world is truly unsettling. Its the world of the blacks. They span the other worlds: they are smiling, happy audience, pleased to be in the fields picking cotton and to be distracted by the fun of the boat. They are natural performers, just look at one for a moment and they amuse. In fact, there is a story element strangely shoehorned in that depends on the top, sexy, unstable actress being "secretly" black -- supposedly explaining her passions and talents. This actress falls into sexual slavery in the gambling world.

The core of the story follows a young girl as she drifts among these worlds. Its famously bad, except for the "Old Man River" segment. Its truly fine in so many ways. But seeing it in such a context ruins it.

I've seen this several times. I believe that the original Technicolor print revealed painfully bad colors in the production design: costumes, hair, environment, everything. Now there does not seem to be a good print in existence, so the colors are even worse. Its horrible.

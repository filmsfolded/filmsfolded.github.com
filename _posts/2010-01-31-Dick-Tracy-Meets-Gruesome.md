The reason I like to dip into old "mysteries" is because sometimes they are extremely clever. This one has one of the more interesting ideas behind it.

Oh, the movie itself is as dull as a soft brick. A newspaper rat threatens to report on the problem, throwing people into a panic and causing a run on the banks... unless Tracy comes through in a few hours.

But the idea is sweet.

The bad guy here is played by Boris Karloff. In the first few minutes, there is a joke about the strangeness being like dealing with Boris Karloff. He plays a guy who apparently dies and then comes to life. He coopts a good-hearted but twisted scientist who has created a seemingly magical formula. The formula causes people to freeze (while banks are robbed) , allowing for an inexpensive cinematic effect.

The bad guy's sidekick is x-ray. Tracy's final ruse has him bandaged up like the mummy. 

The film itself is a bore. But you can imagine the glee in the home of the writer, when he put this together. Writers. Love em.

Spoilers herein.

Here we have a film that could have been great about another that could also have been.

Gilliam has problems: he isn't an intelligent man and doesn't have much interesting to say, but he does have an active visual imagination and I really appreciate his use of space. Cervantes is not only great, he (with Shakespeare) invented what it means to see one's self. The book is about books, self-referential representation and lucid fantasy, which in a simple lighthearted way is Gilliam's strength.

It could have been an interesting film, especially with Depp involved as the two made Gilliam's most successful realization of a created reality. But the missed opportunity pales in comparison to, say, Welles' ideas for a similar project: less bombastic and deeper. Nevertheless, an interesting documentary could have been made exploring just what Gilliam's quirks meant for the project. Instead we get a documentary on an insurance case. I suppose we do need some information on what went wrong, but it is useless information unless we understand what it was that could have gone right. We see some costumes and tests for Giants, nothing more. 

Just what did he have in mind? Why did that vision so uniquely demand Rochefort? What was all that added bumpf about a traveler from the future, and how does that annotate the layers of the novel?

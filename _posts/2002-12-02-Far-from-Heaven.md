Spoilers herein.

I have not seen many of Julianne's early projects. She may be uninteresting in them. But her Yelena in 'Vanya' was an important event in film acting, displaying the same multidimensional ability as Brando in 'Streetcar.' That's where the actor plays both the character and the actor playing the character (and perhaps other things as well) simultaneously. Blancett and Winslet have since achieved this. Now, along comes a film with no room at all for this 'other' way of making and watching film.

This film depends on us all taking it seriously. There cannot be any ironic reflection. There cannot be any 'fancy' acting. So while Moore does the job, hundreds or thousands of others could have too. She is merely a set dressing, just like the overly romanticized blacks. (Are these the visitors Viola Davis hosts in "Solaris?")

Moore must have done this as a favor for the early break Haynes gave her. Makes me remember fondly 'Mr and Mrs Bridges,' which also played it straight, but instead seemed worthwhile at the end.

I also study redheads in film. What a bonanza here! But this seems to be a matter of production design than any understanding or archetypes.

I admit that I find Laurel and Hardy tiresome. If you do too, you might find some relief in this rather unusual project.

The "boys" as a two man jazz band. As the foils in a scheme to bilk people using "gas pills," (some of which are still legally sold to suckers today in the US).

And third in elaborate disguises to bilk another group of con men out of their unearned rewards. Its this last where the payoff is: two by now tired old men playing their scampy characters, playing film stereotypes: a Texas oilman and a rich spinster.

Its not a memorable film experience, but it is likely the best I know of them other than what I think is one of their first film appearances as inmates of an asylum in "Call of the Cuckoo."

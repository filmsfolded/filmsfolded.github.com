Spoilers herein.

The current evolution of this genre depends on manifold twists at the end. The twists here are pretty high quality as slasher stock goes. They show some cleverness: extra teenagers, extra red herrings, some new information 'explaining' the motive, some element of justice which both punishes and justifies further wrath in sequels. All this in a context of repeated, possibly nested dreams with a final ambiguous denouement.

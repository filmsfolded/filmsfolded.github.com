You've seen this plot before: someone sees a body and then it disappears. Flustered unbelieving cops, Irish because of the era. 

In this case, that same device is pulled three times on the cops, then in the finale is turned around and pulled twice on the bad guys. 

Here we have a charming detective who takes enough nonchalant risks to get himself in trouble, and enough pluck to get himself out. 

But we have some cool narrative devices that play with the detective genre, not yet quite fully formed, but formed enough to honk with. Our detective remarks that the mystery would be more interesting if a beautiful woman in distress appeared. In a few seconds this happens, with absolutely no reason. Its as if he just wrote it that way. She mentions that he is like someone out of a book. Later, he calls in a story to the bad guys and they believe it.

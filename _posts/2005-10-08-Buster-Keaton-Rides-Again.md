Sometimes we are lucky. In this case, we have a man who in his prime was an absolute genius, someone who invented many of the ways we think in images. Also, he is solely responsible for one of the mainstays of film humor, extreme physical stretches with dead, dead loneliness. Bill Murray is who carries this today, less well I think.

Anyway we have this guy. Destroyed by drink and serial misdoubts. He is already dying. A dumb, uninteresting man who can only pretend to be his younger self. Our luck is that a second film crew follows him about and we see him "off camera."

The result is a true tragedy, one that really affected me. Why should great men fade? Need they go so low?

In terms of production, this is pretty poor, as many documentaries are. We just take what the camera happens to capture and fill in the missing pieces ourselves.

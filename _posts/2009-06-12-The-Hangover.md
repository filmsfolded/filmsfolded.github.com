The detective story. We have many cases where humor is overlain.

But we have few cases where the mystery involves the detectives. Usually the detective is implicated in some way, or is involved through some matter of honor. Other than "D O A" I do not know of another film where the detectives were the victims. 

The jokes work here, as does the pacing. It has energy. But the thing that intrigues me is the mystery. We have a missing tooth and a missing groom. There is an unexplained animal, baby, police car, wedding and pursuer. The setup, with a pending wedding that sets the clock ticking, probably relies overly on us having seen "Sideways."

The strange engineering here is the distance maintained between the guy world and the girl world. Its too consistent and effective to be mere intuition. There are script consultants for this sort of thing but it is so well integrated I believe it have been there at the beginning. We have the chatty quite lovely bride, steeping in girlie stuff in soft poses. There is a prostitute who factors in the mystery. It seems they had to reach far to find someone as appealing as Heather Graham: needy, attractive, innocent but still a hooker. And then there is the bitch, harder than any stereotype known to me.

The result is the reinforcement of the insular pretend work which we enter in order to enjoy the story. "Los Vegas" is just a way of assigning a space, as is the idea of locating on the roof.

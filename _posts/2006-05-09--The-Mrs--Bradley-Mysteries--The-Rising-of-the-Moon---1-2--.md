Pity the poor scriptwriter given this as a challenge.

Create a Peter Wimsey type, except make her an aged flapper who would have been far ahead of flapperdom. Have her pointedly look at the camera and provide witticisms galore. What folded fun! Have her stumble upon mysteries and pretend she is a detective. In fact, have her be a world famous detective and allow everyone to call her that, but in reality have every step of the mystery be revealed by accident.

In this case, the accident is a suspect who hides in her car and becomes a key witness.

As with the first of the four, have this begin in a folded manner (since scriptwriting school says that's effective). So our thriller begins with a show, one presented by "travellers." The show within melds with the show we are watching when the young woman (the target for the knives), stumbles onto the stage having been killed by a knife.

Be sure to place the female detective in peril at the end, after showing a hugely shocking (for TeeVee) murder.

That's the scriptwriter's challenge. Your challenge, dear reader, is to find better ways to relax.

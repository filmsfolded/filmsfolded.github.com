There's a difference between a joke and the idea of a joke. The idea of a nun demolition derby (no cars) is much more engaging than any actual cinematic expression of it. Most funny ideas are like this. On the other hand, the South Park episode where a kid wants pubes so buys them is so much funnier in its expression than its idea.

The job of a comedian is primarily to understand the difference between the two. Trey and Matt learned the difference after this movie. Kevin Smith never learned. This a darned funny idea, but there's nothing funny about the movie itself. (Excepting a couple slapstick bits by Toddy Walters, someone who actually seems to have talent. Some sites other than IMDb have her as an editor on "Thin Red Line"!)

Otherwise, the film is structured according to film school guidance: introspective folding by a film about film-making.

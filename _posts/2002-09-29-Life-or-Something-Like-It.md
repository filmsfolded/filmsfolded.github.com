Spoilers herein.

We are in an avalanche of films about film and TeeVee situations and people. Screenwriters have discovered this largely unmined territory and are exploring it. I'm thankful, because the very idea is self-referential and it comes with a requirement that some examination of referential layering occur. And that's happening, even in extremely lowbrow films like this we get the nub of an interesting idea.

That nub is wrapped around the old faithful: you have died and get a second chance, or you are going to die, or even you are transported to an alternative reality or future time to see what life could be or not be unless you change. Pretty old stuff that. What's new here is the introduction of TeeVee as the reflection of the wheel of fortune. Our focus (the hapless Jolie) is a TeeVee person. She gets her fate in stages from the TeeVee as if it were God. Or the type of god that the real film is: something that reflects what is written.

So the screenwriter, like so many, decided to put some intelligent notion in their pedestrian fast food script. Apparently no one else involved in the project knew. But this has one shot worthy of note. On the morning of Thursday when she enters the studio, there is an anticipative tracking shot worthy of dePalma.

Spoilers herein.

When I enter one of these worlds, I expect risk. Not by itself of course, but paired with clever  insight, unusual metaphor or sliding perspective. But above all, risk. Their risk is my risk.  Quite literally, I enter these film relationships promiscuously without protection, bare,  expecting permanent change.

That's why I have higher expectations for something like this. But alas, this is not a risky  project. In fact, it wraps itself in 80's satire and mundane fimmaking. It is too safe. It is as if  its own condom kills it.

This is a deceptive film. Nominally, it is a thin excuse for nudity. Very appealing nudity, which is the point.

Under that is a simple "discovery of sexuality" story, Some competent acting here, relatively good. Some small jokes, some small drama. But it isn't profound enough to justify the peek show. So at the end you feel that your excuse for this is too thin.

But an intelligent viewer may see it at a third level. 

The deal at this level: an artist makes a work of art with prurient interest, wrapped in some allegory. The idea is a cheap conceptual orgasm. That's the story here and the nature of the film both.

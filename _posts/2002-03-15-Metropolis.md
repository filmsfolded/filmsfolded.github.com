Spoilers herein.

Definitions about what this is and is not. And a statement about what it defined.

I do not consider this science fiction. SciFi is a subset of a genre based on the creation of a coherent alternative world. In the case of SciFi, the framework is science, or in lesser efforts sometimes technology. The idea works because it can depend on the mind's extrapolation according to the rules of the world set up according to by now well defined conventions. That way, the viewer or reader can enter an alternative world (not just a story) and 'understand' it. Understand the story in the context of a world that differs.

Metropolis is expressionism, something that depends on THIS world as its basis. The images are dreams, always tied to our reality. That means that everything seen here is an abstraction of our reality, which is completely opposite to the SciFi dynamic. In SciFi, we take a few familiar things into a different world. This is anti SciFi. There is no science here, just a golem. There is no alternative world, just an abstraction of our world. That abstraction is great in one respect, as I'll say below. But it is abstraction, not extrapolation. Symbolic art, not science fiction.

It is also not purely cinematic either. In my book, for something to be valued cinema, it has to use a visual vocabulary that exploits dynamic narrative -- which is to say it has to be more than a filmed play or an illustrated text. The narrative has to be placed in the vision.

What we have here is a heavyhanded symbolic text of a morality play that is illustrated by a genius who somehow convinced financiers to give him sufficient resources. And I do mean genius, but as a designer of images, not cinema. What's really interesting is that many of these images are so original, so powerful that they have been adopted and used by many who followed. And some of those who followed really were cinematically grounded: Kubrick, Scott, Greenaway, even Kurosawa. The point is that Lang is no Eisenstein but a source for Eisensteins.

But he is a visual genius, no doubt. See this for its historical import in the development of visual grammars as well (if you are interested) as a factor in shaping (or reflecting if you wish) the Nazi horror.

I love it when films are self-referential in a straightforward way. Lang himself was much like Fredersen, and the heavihanded way he threw the story around (not to mention the cast and crew) is much like the totalitarian manner of the city. That heartlessness, of which much is made in the story, is apparent in the film's stance, even central. That's because abstraction of this sort is by definition intellectually unemotional.

The Madacy DVD has horrible transfer.

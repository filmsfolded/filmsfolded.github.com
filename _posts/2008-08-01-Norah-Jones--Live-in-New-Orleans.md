Norah does essentially nothing on stage in terms of showmanship and patter.

She simply sits there, plays and sings, with a calm that contradicts the soul we hear that can only be true and come from some sort of purity. So we hear this music. Its a bit similar, all of it, but it touches deeply and we know its mined from some hidden but known place.

So it matters that we see her placid. It matters a whole lot. In fact, its everything to see a woman deliver such emotion with such a calm demeanor as if she were cleaning a kitchen. 

I have seen comments here and elsewhere that this is "not wort watching" because she makes no show. That IS the show, folks. And its everything that matters. Everything.

If you see this, you will know why our greatest living filmmaker of films about women chose her to build a movie around, a movie about a slightly ever so slightly off center soul.

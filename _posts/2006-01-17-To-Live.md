When you come to these, you expect beauty and the sweep of society and how it jostles the humans we're touching. You expect that as the advertised values.

But I want something more than a good book well illustrated. This crop of Chinese filmmakers looks for the "soul" of the story in what some might call a gimmick, what they call the story-image. 

In some cases, this can make art that is lifealtering. "Zhou Yu's Train" with this actress was one of these for me. It was a delicate, complex weave among the layers of the story and the story-image reference of the train. And it explored that train from perspectives that were amazingly new.

"Chinese Box," also with this same actress used a more human device. Kar-wei's films are the ultimate for me because he has transcended this notion of needing a visual metaphor/ allegory as an anchor.

This director, used the notion of space in "Hero" as the story-image in that film, together with the notion that space itself could be the storyteller, and this is compounded by there being many candidate space-tellers.

In this film, he uses the shadowpuppets as his device. I'm attracted to that because it is a sort of play within the play that is embossed on the play. Sure, the movie itself is about humans as puppets of society -- and got him in trouble with the puppetmasters.

So I will recommend it on that basis: a folded film that happens to be lush and beautiful in a way that is enhanced by the folds.

But if you want a more cinematic story-image see "Hero." If you want a richer fold with that image and this lovely actress, see "Zhou Yu's Train." And if you want these ideas in the extremest depth and effectiveness, see the pair of "In the Mood for Love" and "2046."

Its a strange recommendation for a film to situate it among others that do elements better. But this is definitely worth your energy, investing your soul.

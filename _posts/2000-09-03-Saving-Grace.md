The Brits have some natural advantages that they keep blowing. British actors have always been distinctive, since perhaps Irving. Many of those acting characteristics: apparent self-consciousness, facial hesitations, practiced body fluidity when speaking... seem more appropriate and satisfying today in the revival of character acting.

British production values are generally higher than Hollywood's. Only part of that pertains to using actors who can act, a different issue than that noted above. They seem to spend more time on language and manner to set the tone of the film, and less on high concept machinery: bombastic music, special effects, action, simple conflicts. And the English seem to engage the audience in natural environments in a more intimate way than anyone else except the Australians.

Now, we have a fad of village films where the English poke fun at themselves for the benefit of Americans. The idea is a little tawdry, especially when quaintness and simpleness of rurals is used as the main tool. Make no mistake, this is a film made for American audiences: at the very beginning someone speculates that the husband's death was due to his mistaking the door of the bathroom. No Brit would say that, but what they would say might puzzle Ohians.

This film starts off so well, leveraging all these British strengths. The actors are very good, Grace is first class. Though derivative of other films (even Hamlet), the first 20 minutes sweep us, intrigue and tease. Then it all devolves into so much mush. 

And that's all independent of the story, which is incidental in any case, so long as townspeople get to act silly, wise, loyal. But how quaint to focus on dope. Did the writers believe Americans would think this cute? To judge from early reception, I guess it is true. How humorously, with what condescension the world must see us. Secrets and Lies is more true, uses Blethyn better and embarrasses neither maker nor viewer.

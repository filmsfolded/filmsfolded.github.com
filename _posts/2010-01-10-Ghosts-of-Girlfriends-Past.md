This trivial thing -- yes even this -- has a marvelous scene in it. 

It is the scene directly after being visited by the third ghost. This is where a production designer earns his/her money. This is a DAT movie in the regular form. That means that certain things have to happen, including the love-notlove-love cycle, the public dramatic penultimate event and at the very end: a wedding. 

That wedding has to be a white and tearful, as celebratory and satisfactory as possible. There are a few conventions that must, absolutely must be followed and among them is the wedding dress. Usually there isn't much flexibility that a designer has here and much is determined by the era and the target demo.

But in this case, we have a ghost who appears. She happens to lead to the wedding that might have happened, the love in question to another guy. Naturally, she wears a gown less romantic in this dream wedding than in the payoff one at the end. What may not be obvious to you if you have not seen this is that this ghost -- the ghost of girlfriends future -- who gets to wear the reference wedding dress that allows you to emboss extra emotion on the dress at the end.

This reference dress, the one the ghost wears, provides the advantage of special effects. It can sparkle like snow, have smoke-like lace, and be lifted against gravity with a magical lightness. Because we are not confined to a church, or any real location, we can have shots that you cannot otherwise have. Here we have an overhead shot where he is following her train from a winter landscape into fall. That winter snow, if I recall correctly, is the "snow" of all his used condoms. 

It isn't anything that will go in the books. But it shows that these romance movies are highly engineered products, and that this production designer knew her stuff cinematically and understood the moving parts involved.

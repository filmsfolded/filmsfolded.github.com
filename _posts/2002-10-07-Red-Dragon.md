Spoilers herein.

Wow, what a mess. Comparisons with the other two Hopkins' Hannibals are inevitable. As I found with comparing the various 'Alien's, this comparison is a crash course in filmmaking.

The original project was centered in the characters, after the fashion of theater. Hopkins was once a great actor in this tradition and Foster still was. In this approach, everything is pegged to the characters. The camera tracks them as if it were tied by strings. All elements of the production are there to support these tractors. Because the director is attuned to how this works, he was able to develop the proper supportive tone. The tone follows the characters.

Scott works exactly the other way. He is in charge of creating a world of conflict and motion and class. Within that world, characters exist and wheels turn. But the characters are subject to the fate determined by their environment. The characters follow the tone. This is harder for an actor to support, and they got a much better, more selfaware actress in Julianne Moore. She knows how to do this, and has in several different ways in other projects. This second film had a much less well constructed story, but the cinematic values were much higher than the first. Which of the two approaches you prefer pretty much indicates your whole philosophy, your whole self.

Now along comes this third installment, obviously constructed by numbskull studio bosses, not a filmmaker. If two or three good actors was good (for the first), then six must be better, so we have six very strong, but very different types of actors. PT Andersen knows how to mix different recipes of this type, but here most of these actors (the featured ones anyway) do among their worst work.

The biggest transgression is Hopkins. He's been cruising on rememberences for a while now. It's the Peter O'Toole effect and I don't think we'll ever get him back. Ed Norton isn't a real actor. Here's a test: a real actor -- regardless of the approach -- settles their whole selves into the character. That's the only way to make things work. A poor actor is always there, always present, controlling his instrument. That uses one side of the brain as a puppetmaster for the rest of the body. That works for all parts of the body but the face: the two halves are unavoidably controlled by the two sides of the brain.

So, for example watch Harrison Ford. When he speaks, only one side of his mouth moves. When he uses his eyes (rare) only one is affected. You can literally see one side of his face as the actor manipulating the other side as character. Now watch Ed Norton here. Same thing. Impossible to hide if you are a bad actor, an incomplete artist.

The only one who does both good and appropriate work is Philip Seymour Hoffman. For the third time (after 'State' and 'Almost') he gives us a writer around which the project revolves. He is the filmmaker's surrogate in these three projects. Except for the last sequence, he plays the fool and the god both. His specialty. Unfortunately, the filmmaker doesn't have a clue this is going on.

In fact, the filmmaker is completely oblivious to such self-referential layers the writer intended: the screenwriter as newswriter; the filmmaker as video producer, the author as Blake.

Almodovar has given me some of the richest times of my cinematic life. I'm glad he was born and found his way to me. I consider "Speak to Her," a necessary experience.

What I like are the ordinary things of course, what others remark on: how he enhances tragic immediacy through humor. Also how he makes faces signify. But there are other things that are special to me: 

-- how on the edges he merges the film we see with films (or TeeVee) within so we have an unobtrusive reminder of the introspection the humor suggests but cannot reify.

-- how multiple narratives overlap in layered ways, so that multiple agency is overt. Its the exact opposite of noir, and a subtle but welcome invitation to an open life. Usually, there's an element of expression in these narratives: in "Speak" it was speaking, dancing, watching, having lucid sex, bullfighting, writing...

-- how women's lives balance between that edge of noir and the world of magical impulse we who watch are given to live in. This is, I think related to how he pins his scenes together, never connecting ends to beginnings but just off to the side as if we were surfing reality.

So, I value Pedro. Or I did. This is not good. Oh, I suppose its good compared to everything else. Cruz does amazing things with that near-witch face, and the story is dear. But that's a damning thing to be able to say.

This movie makes sense. That's bad. It endears. That's bad too, for an Almodovar world. Its linear, with one story. Sure, we have a few nods to the method: a film crew rescues Cruz's character: a character goes on TeeVee to expose a plot point; a corpse ends up in a "Rope" inspired trunk (actually a freezer, but made to look like Hitchcock's trunk). 

But none of that matters. What we are left with is the story itself, not any significant annotation. Sure, there are more subtle folds than normal: there are overlapping deaths (three and a half of them); there are overlapping returns; there are folded mother-daughter dynamics. But they are all in the story itself, not what Almodovar usually gives us in looking at the story.

This is not life-altering.

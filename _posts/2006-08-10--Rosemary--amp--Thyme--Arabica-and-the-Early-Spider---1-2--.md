These are dreadful. This is the second I have seen.

In this one, our two women are living together and have opened a gardening business. They argue and follow leads, sort of a geriatric scooby doo. In theory, we are supposed to be charmed by three things. The idea of women buddies with no love interest. The idea of a mystery and detecting conflated with gardening. And the thrill of seeing modern English gardens and houses.

You can imagine the PowerPoint presentation on this.

Well, I find the buddy thing unoriginal and the link between gardening and detecting forced. That only leaves the house and garden, whether they are worth the visit. Actually they were in the first episode. Fine stuff, that.

This one has no garden -- they are supposed to be creating one. And the house is dull.

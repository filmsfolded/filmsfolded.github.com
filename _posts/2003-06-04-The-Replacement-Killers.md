My God, what a disaster. The idea here is to take a well established style and bring it to the states, using top notch performers. Not too many chances are to be taken, and even the story should remain in China to minimize risk. But get a white girl who specializes in professionally exploring sexual projection, better that she speaks some Chinese.

The style is everything. Saturated colors, lots of reflections and folding, mixed POV and dancing camera - especially when Chow swings one way ablazin' and the camera another, lots of strokes sweeping up and all in an easy to read package. This time, they put it in the hands of a director that is expert enough in the sense that he knows the motions. But he has no fire, no creative eye. He has no rhythm. The workmanlike photography and editing copies the template by the numbers, but there is no dance here.

This is a jazz medium. Either you are in the groove, or you fake it. Don't settle for these replacements, go to the real thing.

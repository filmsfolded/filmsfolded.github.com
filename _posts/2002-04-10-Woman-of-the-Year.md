Spoilers herein.

This film is absolutely depressing.

It has deplorable politics. The story makes no sense. It has no charm, and the funny parts aren't funny.

Spencer Tracy is uninteresting in my book. He is the sort of 'just show up' actor that Gene Hackman is today.

What is interesting is Hepburn. She has a very striking presence, and developed a reading style akin to Bogart's: halting in exaggerated places. This is the predecessor of that annoying mannerism of TeeVee talking heads where they bob their heads with a related rhythm.

I usually can find something interesting in any film. Its a hobby. But here there is nothing at all noteworthy. Folks, this is the stuff our kids have been making fun of for years.

Michelle has based her living on her face, and it is showing signs of too many tuneups. Ford might have had a stroke, but who would know?

I understand a squad of script doctors worked on this, which explains the splice of two script ideas. Also a fixit team was called in late in the game. Shows. But there's just too much broken here.

Even I was disappointed.

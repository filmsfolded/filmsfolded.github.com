Spoilers herein.

Some films stay relevant; some adapt as the world changes and change their power. And others fade from relevance as the environment moves under it. 'Alfie' is one of a large class of these  films based on shocking by pushing a cinematic convention beyond its then state.

Here we have something novel in its time: the contrast of lightness of attitude and heavy, even tragic consequences. This 'comic tragedy' form was invented by Fletcher (and Shakespeare), and has since 1966 been revived and entered pop sameness.

The hook this time is casual treatment of women. I recall this being apt and sharp in its day. A curiosity now, like 'The Exorcist.' Some committed acting on the part of the women, mostly redheads and including the notable Jane Asher.

She would go home to Paul McCartney just at the period when he was captivated by Alfred Jarry, and working on real ideas in theater.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3  you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

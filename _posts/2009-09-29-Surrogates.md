This movie pulled me out of a research project in AI for a break, so the comment is pretty biased.

The setup is not typical for a robot movie, though it is clearly Phil Dick territory. That territory is characterized by watching, seeing and how it transforms the soul. Its is smack in the center of cinematic annotative folding -- modern metacinema if you will. 

We have people in transmitting chairs -- unimaginatively conventional for movie-land. They control physical avatars. It is a virtual reality set in physical reality, but of course the physical reality we see is a movie construction of reality. So we have extremely typical, predictable, almost retro stunts and effects as if this were a video game.

What makes this a modern folded narrative is that while we watch an artificial reality with characters that give us vicarious pleasure, we have the characters themselves do it. While we have an overview of the world, essentially through the eyes of others, the plot revolves around the only human we see that doesn't have an avatar. He runs a "watching" operation where he literally sees through the eyes of everyone on the planet other than the revolutionaries.

This, by the way is a strange setup. In the real world, if you wanted machines to watch and interpret, they would simply be directly connected to cameras and other sensors. By an extreme stretch, all the cameras here are human eyes that display on millions of ordinary "movie" screens, to be watched by an anthropomorphic robot with similar robot eyes. Clearly, this stretch is to make the fold obvious, the watching fold.

Robin Williams' "The Final Cut" imagined this process with sharper, more disturbing metaphors.

More, the danger in this world comes from attacks through the eyes. The eyes of the remotely controlled robots connect to the eyes of their human controllers. (Technologically indicated eyeflaps are the only connection we see between man and machine by the way.) Some sort of movieland sparkley thing goes into the surrogates eyes (only vulnerable if watching), fries them and the artificial brain, conveys to the human, and "liquifies the brain" and blows out the eyes. It is pretty apparent that the writer of this thing was working from a folding perspective.

The plot involves someone else, someone watching in a space between our on screen noir detective (Willis) and us. Sadly, he is played by James Cromwell, who is too associated with legal roles (the evil senior partner) to work for me. 

I find Willis to be the perfect actor for this. He acts with his eyes, and knows how to provide a link with the audience outside his character. Usually this is called "winking at the audience," but I believe it is much deeper, complex.

Oh, there are women too. As with your usual noir detective flow, they are further down in the causal food chain.

Spoilers herein.

One of the most exciting promises of film is the ability to transport us to different worlds. Because a film carries information about the viewer, a skilled filmmaker can literally turn us into someone different for a while. So one would think that being transported to the rather alien world of Spanish film would be a welcome adventure. But this - at least - disappoints.

Latins differ from Northern Europeans and nearly all North Americans in how they deal with abstraction. For Northerners, there is a notion of pure, higher values, apart from life. Stories illustrate great ideas, conflicts, questions, and no matter how realistic the situation shown, we know it is merely representative. This is a cultural convention found even in comedies and 'date' movies. Check it out.

Latins instead have a notion of a world centered in real people and real events where small acts aggregate. When common themes emerge, they grow out of life, so in art we have abstractions from life rather than life illustrating some invisible clockworks. Consequently, when Pedro tells a story, he becomes obsessed with a culturally rooted notion of honesty. The primary value we are supposed to appreciate here is his honesty, then the honesty of his actresses (the nonwomen men are just buffoons and poltroons), and finally, the honesty of the 'real' characters.

Then he takes all the self-referential tricks of his northern brethren and grafts them on. So here we have the film portraying a life, portrayed in a play, which references a film. The actors play characters playing actors. Some roles are transplanted from one to another - and just so we will not miss this, our heroine is a transplant facilitator who leaves her job to follow her son's heart.

Actually, in another context, this could work well. And in fact there are several even recent films which successfully use much the same devices. But here, the notions of abstraction clash. Pedro wants to pander to Spanish notions of Olympian soap opera, and at the same time be considered a 'serious' filmmaker by global viewers (well, forget the viewers to judge from his interviews, it is the critics who are targeted). Sorry, just doesn't mix - doesn't work in either venue.

An unrelated complaint is Barcelona. What a wonderful place: this city was built for films. Some filmmakers would truly use this opportunity to exploit Gaudi's notions of motion in space: what else is film? But here, we have a lost opportunity, save some colored tiles. Worse, Pedro presents the place as if it were a Spanish city. It is no such thing. It is half African; it considers itself a separate nation; it speaks a different language; it hosts a cosmopolitan notion of modernity. It is to the world now what Paris was to the 30s but in three dimensions rather than two. 

It is ripe for exploitation for just this type of film, especially considering the sexual mores, the escape, the Alice-like entrance tunnel. How could he miss this?

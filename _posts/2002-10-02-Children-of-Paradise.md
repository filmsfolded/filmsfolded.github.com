I have experienced this work several times now, and each time come away conflicted.

The story is straight out of Bulwer-Lytton: a huge machine of coincidence about four men who love one woman. Lots of melodramatic excess, so much that it annoys. It is very French in that way -- drearily fatalistic and romantic. But it is also typically French in the element that makes it exceptional and intelligent: it is a deeply self-referential exploration about the manner of performance and writing for performance. And in that respect it is perhaps the standard of excellence.

(Both of these qualities are also the driver behind the similarly structured 'Amelie' and "Moulin Rouge")

'Citizen Kane' and 'Annie Hall' exploit many different narrative devices, in parallel and conflicting. But they are only mildly self-referential. Not so here: the film itself starts off with a rising curtain and trusts us directly into a world (literally a street) where everyone is a performer. Then it runs through all sorts of narrative acrobatics...

It is a history of French performing arts. This is not so interesting to this viewer, except for an appreciation to detail. What impresses is the structure. Like Kubrick's '2001,' the entire project is a struggle among four men, each involved in the theater, for control over the story. They do that on screen of course, but all of them will go on afterward to write a play. Whose play are we seeing? Clearly all four, battling before our eyes. We have the four types of narrative moving back and forth in influence. In two cases, we see the background plays of two of these (the traditional mime, the 'Othello'), both terminated by Garance. These four are:

The assertive vocal style where the metaphor of poetry defines the world, even when the broken word makes a broken world. 

The scurrilous written style which hides behind the mysterious veil of the page, steals from reality for fiction to be turned again into reality through actor buffoons.

The purely visual image, oddly enchanting but seemingly reluctant in inveigling into our souls

The viewer, who by himself and his selfish consumption of narrative is the root of dramatic creation.

I believe no two people will see the same film; each of us will surf the various influences here in a slightly different way, depending on how you see the world. Each of us are children of the gods, meaning spectators in the house to be manipulated at will.

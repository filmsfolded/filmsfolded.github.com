One of the most delicious things about art, is the matter of the artists. What to do with them?

So often, they are the art and what we are left is the residue of extraordinary lives. It is Vincent's soul that I see when I celebrate one of his later paintings -- his touching of god through liquid eyes, crying and drinking. 

But for example, when I encounter Chihuly, I want the self-promoting brute to simply get out of the way so that I can meditate on some crystal assembly as the light changes. It is one of the most mysterious and wonderful things in my life, this inability to predict how to approach the thing.

But what do you do when you make a film of a man's art? You know it has to be narrated, "explained." And if the artist is alive, you simply cannot escape taking a chance with him. This time it works. You have the intent, which in this case is worthy. You have the art itself, which by itself is mildly interesting. You have the film, the photography of the sculpture; this is the most remarkable because the cinematic form can capture the sense of place that you need to capture the intend in the artifact.

And you have the artist's narration. This is the most curious thing. What he actually says is insipid, plain. Earnest and pure, but uninteresting. But HOW he says it; how he phrases his words as artifacts of perception; how he moves his body and plants himself in the context... this is engaging as all getout.

The works in this film will gather the bits of you that matter and make them matter. It is a remarkable achievement, the conflation of place, the place of man, and the place of object. You will find that this film works.

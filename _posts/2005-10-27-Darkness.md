Sometimes it works to bring elements from all over the genre into one hodgepodge movie. That can be especially interesting when the story and the tone of the thing is set up as a conflict between all these forces. Its particularly easy to do when inventing occult dynamics. Its all artificial anyway, always bent to what works in movies (and sometimes books).

But this conflation is a mess. But you probably already knew that.

I came to it because of two reasons. 

The first is that I collect movies that feature buildings as characters. The haunted house is usually boring, but sometimes these things will surprise you. Like "13 Ghosts." But I have to report that even the design of the thing (and the secret portal) is unimaginative.

The other attraction was Lena Olin. She is not a great actress, But she is an icon of sorts, and is used as such now.

"Mystery Men." "Lightness." "Fanny." even "Queen of the Damned."

But most of all "Ninth Gate." All she has to do is show up and it is worthwhile for me so long as the director is in on the joke. But she isn't here. Too bad, it would have been a freebee.

All they had to do was photograph her nicely. Nope.

The greatest film tragedies are the people with talent who get swallowed by the system.

Soderbergh obviously has the mind of a filmmaker for the rest of us, those of us interested in reflexive films. He started life with 'Sex Lies,' a minor gem. In between his slickly wrapped cowpatties, he's shoehorned in some work that gives us hope: his 'Limey' was all about the perceptive eye. 'Frontal' was intelligently the obverse.

He likes to be his own cinematographer and editor. He likes to work with 'simple' actors, those who know nothing about the larger issues of film and don't care: they just do their thing.

This man has been able to live a double life until now, shifting between stupid films that made money and art which justifies a life. Depending on what world we live in, we forgave his excursions into the other. Now he tries something dangerous: both at the same time.

The story and the existing Tarkovsky film are lovely explorations into the matter of created realities, intrusive memory and the nature of film creation. The Tarkovsky treatment took advantage of the fact that he was first someone who lived in a folded world of symmetries and hidden causality. His camera is highly architectural, it lingers and discovers truths in odd places, it incidentally discovers. It is not a knowing eye, but a languorous, understanding one involved in a complex set of t'ai chi movements.

It shows a lot of courage for Soderbergh to enter this world of illusion, especially with Cameron in charge, someone whose notion of meditative image is a world that explodes slowly, accompanied by elevator music. Once again, Soderbergh uses actors that are too ignorant of the issues involved to get in the way.

Where Tarkovsky had an eye rooted in the created world, Soderbergh stays in the real world. Where T's eye lingered, S's eye could have stuttered -- something S knows how to do. Instead, he plays it straight. We have no intelligent eye here at all. T had sets like 'Rear Windows,' where the actual architecture is a response to the nature of the eye. S has a shockingly ordinary space, similar in notion to the O'Hare terminal in Chicago. His eye never has a relationship at all with the space.

There are a few interesting ambiguities, but these are all plot devices, not cinematic ones: we do not know if Gordan is a replicant; we do not know if the last scene takes place on 'real' Earth, or in a fabricated Earth in the real Kelvin's mind. We do not know the extent to which Gibarian's son is involved in the conspiracy to get Kelvin "home," and his relationship to an inferred affair between Gibarian and Rheya. All we have is the doorknob.

Kelvin went on a watered down journey, but Soderbergh never answered the call.

Spoilers herein.

Some films are born already bound to their soulmate, and so it is with this one.

I resaw it because a reader had challenged me on my criticism of some film stars who just aren't real actors in any sense. Harrison Ford is one of these, so I went in search of a film where he actually got on top of the character. I think he did here -- only here. He has said this was his best acting. To his credit, he admits he's not a real actor, but he is proud of this mad idealist.

But that's by far not the most interesting thing here: all the actors do well. The interesting thing is the bond with 'Fitzcarraldo.' You really must see these two films together.

Fitz is a wonderful 1982 film by Werner Herzog, built around the intense Klaus Kinski. The story is:

A man, loosely connected to reality, is obsessed with bringing a new world to the jungle. His initial plans center on setting up an ice factory on a river in the jungle. A key vision in the film is the sledging of a huge item up a hill from the river. Things go awry, resulting in a final journey downstream. In an ambiguous end, Kinski has possibly died and makes a triumphal return.

Now, Shafer has reshaped this with children, one of whom narrates. In this version, the ice factory is what rises from the river: in Fitz, it is a huge ship. In both cases, an incidental target is societal brainwashing. Herzog's version is intense and monocular. Weir's is more a conventional story and he really does well with this cast. There is no fancy perspective of the camera on either part: the viewer is invisible and passive. 

Both are effective in their own way. See them both to get one excellent film.

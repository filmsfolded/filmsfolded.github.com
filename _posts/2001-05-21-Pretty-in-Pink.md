Spoilers herein.

I watched this for a simple reason: I'm surveying every film version of a Shakespeare play. Young Molly appears in two of the more quirky, intellectual ones. It reminded me that at one time, she was the hottest actress in the English-speaking world. Time magazine and all that.

Her film career started with her role as the Miranda in 'Tempest,' where she complimented a very sexy Susan Sarandon. Then she did three of Hughes' simple stories of angst, with Pink probably the best. This was followed by her Cordelia for the bizarre 'Lear' project of Godard -- an amazing adventure in itself made more extraordinary by the context of 'Pink.' 'Lear' is odd, but she and Burgess Meredith do some intelligent work, actually showing some depth.

Then she turned down 'Pretty Woman,' 'Blue Velvet' (I'm reminded by IMDB) and others I misremember now. She still works apparently, but in 'C' grade projects. Once leader of the 'rat pack," now a nobody. What happened?

Compare this to my current young actress of interest, Julia Stiles. She also got her film start doing Shakespeare; Hamlet, Othello ('O'), Taming of the Shrew ('Ten Things I Hate About You'). In Hamlet, she was extraordinary. She also has worked with a master of film, Mamet ('State and Main'). And she has at least two teen exploitation films under her belt: 'Save the Last Dance' and 'Hate.'

We loved Molly because she adopted a fundamental stereotype and enriched it by inhabiting it. Stiles has done the same with a more modern role: a hip/hop, urban self-referential independent. Will Julia fade as quickly? Is there a Shakespearean curse?

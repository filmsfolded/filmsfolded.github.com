Spoilers herein.

I see a lot of movies, and many many of them are bad. I do this deliberately because so  many bad or mundane movies have interesting features.

Danny Devito sometimes pops up as the interesting feature. This movie was made  because they had access to a some chimps, and could drag out all the funny face and  human/monkey gags.

This is casual filmmaking, and gives the impression that people just showed up for a  week or so. In such cases, actors do their own work in making up characters. Devito is a  smart guy. Watch how he places his character halfway between the humans and the  monkeys.

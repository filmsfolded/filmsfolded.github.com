Spoilers herein.

I admit that I am a nut when it comes to reflexive shows. Those are shows about shows.

Penn and Teller are consummate showmen. Except for a couple dreary lapses, this is a  show about their show. Actually, I found most of it interesting: how they work to give a  showmanlike metashow.

The best trick, I think was the cut boxes, where they repeat the whole thing with glass  boxes so you can see how they did it.

Of all the P&amp;T shows, this is the best because straight magic just doesn't seem very  magical unless you are right there in the theater.

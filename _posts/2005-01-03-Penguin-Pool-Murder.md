This is a truly interesting experiment, the first of the Hidegarde Withers series. I suspect it is the best, though I have not seen all of the others. 

The idea follows on Christie's Miss Marple, who in the books (but not any film adaptation) was an annoying old biddy who bothered everyone but her steady nephew. Every British reader would know the type. In this Americanized incarnation, the biddy is a teacher, someone more accessible.

Interesting what they have done. The mystery format had already transmuted into something where the audience only expected a clever surprise as an ending. The tinkering here is the relationship between the biddy (who tries her best to be annoying) and the hard boiled detective. She wants to be a crimefighter; he eventually respects her intuition. By the end they run off in haste to get married (a state ignored in the sequels).

Unfortunately, though the chemistry between the two is interesting (even 70 odd years later), the thing has no context. The mystery format wasn't thought out well enough to support the chemistry through dialog.

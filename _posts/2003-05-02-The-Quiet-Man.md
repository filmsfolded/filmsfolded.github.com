I am not a fan of John Wayne, or even John Ford; their notion of film is dramatic at the cost of extreme simplicity, even simplemindedness. Ford knows how to frame, but all is in service to that simple dramatic value of Griffith. I am especially unattracted to Irish films dominated by the overbearing romanticism of Irish Americans. This film is as patronizing as 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' of only a couple years later. One wouldn't have a glimmer from this that the Irish are the best storytellers in the world and their stories are characterized less by the broad childish sweeps shown here, but subtlety, ambiguity and self-reference - in short all the things that the Welles tradition followed in reaction to the traditions of Ford. Not until 'Barry Lyndon' do we in the world of film get Ireland back.

But I do appreciate Ms O'Hara. Not as an actress, but as an icon. She owes her fame to Technicolor, which exaggerated her red hair. As she was one of the first big redhead stars in color, she helped established a film archetype. Together with Katherine Hepburn, she defined a notion of independent strength, sex suborned to character, unexpected wisdom, a red mother earth of sorts. This also defined one of the prefabbed pigeonholes we snap to in our own personal relationships. So revisiting these films is a visit into our own history and selves.

Until the last 15 minutes, she is one character: proud, independent, sexy. In that last fifteen minutes she asserts her independence and is violently interrupted by her Yankee thug husband, beaten, dragged roughly through sheep dung in front of the entire village (no small insult). He then extorts the money which forms the one plot thread, burns it in contempt, beats her brother (shown as a noble, even admired contest), and then comes home drunk with the brother and rudely demands dinner. 

She submits, and we ate it up.

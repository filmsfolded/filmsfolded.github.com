Spoilers herein.

Film is engaged in a battle to evolve as a new art form, as a new way of shaping narrative. That's why we celebrate any of the evolutionary steps, no matter how small. Nashville is a small but important step.

The town: Nashville and the subject: country music are not accidental. Country music is the lowest form of narrative in music -- country music is based on stories. These are regular old simple stories that last a minute or two, have a beginning, end and usually a moral. Real, rich music is to country music what Altman and many others hope future film can be to simple storytelling movies.

So he places the narrative right in the Dogpatch of narrative, just as he placed his peace film right in the midst of the artifacts of the destruction of war. The people are ridiculous of course, but that's incidental to the real reason for this to exist.

There is a complete desconstruction of any narrative -- it is all connective tissue instead: various people and symbols moving through episodes. This is NOT like what P T Andersen thinks it is (he reverts to the bedrock of story). It is deliberately storyless.

Some underscores (apart from the obvious contrast between the two recording sessions at the beginning):

--the car wreck which stops progress and the car graveyard (mirrored by the aspiring singer later drowned by racing cars)

--the political candidate who would 'replace' the current order of things (mirrored by the Gibson and Blakely characters who would preserve it)

--the deaf children who cannot hear the stories but have their own to tell visually (mirrored by the actors who ad lib to fill in the holes left by narrative silence)

--even the business about flyswatters (mirrored by the insessant buzzing of the journalist in search of a story)

Altman should be celebrated not because he makes good films, but because he is a kickass revolutionary who undermines the insipid while hardly anyone notices. Unfortunately, this is not a particularly accomplished film visually -- that would come later.

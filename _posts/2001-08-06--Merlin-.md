Spoilers herein.

The Arthur legend has persisted for all this time because it is complex -- it reaches deep, and includes nearly every important theme. It sticks.

If you read about it, say from Teddy White, you can take the already embellished frame and flesh it out with fantasies and conflicts from your own experience and fantasy. It sticks. It lives with you. It is more than an important part of life, it is part of what invents life.

Now turn to this cartoon. It is hard to imagine any viewer (and TeeVee provides a lot of these) leaving with something that sticks. A great, complex work is reduced to -- well, it is even hard to know what the redactors had in mind since every theme is watered down so. Stay away from this production. Its only recommendation is that the actresses' faces are lovely.

But don't shy away from Arthur because of drek like this (and 'First Knight'). Set between the conquest by the Romans and that of the smarmy French, one can find everything associated with being English (a definition concocted in large part by Philip Sydney for Elizabeth.) And what it means to bridge the gap between Celtic magic (the assignation is ahistorical) and Christianity, the religion of the conquerors. And what it means to forget, And what it means to stay home.

Good stuff this. Time and time again, TeeVee (including Ken Burns) reduces riches to simple episodes, always with the excuse that any introduction, even a useless incorrect, misleading one is good because it leads to 'further discovery.' (And Frosted Flakes are part of a healthy breakfast.)

So buck the trend and make it happen. Discover and explore the legend yourself.

Spoilers herein.

I've never been a fan of Tarantino. He borrows from past giants and assembles. I admit he hit a sweet spot with 'Pulp Fiction,' but I am convinced that the most interesting levels of irony in that project are unintentional.

So here we have a project loosely based on Jerry Lewis (and true to QT, we are told so), but without the ironic effect intended. The project misses, though Rodriguez is competently comic.

Roth fascinates. He's not particularly intelligent, but he does have excellent control over his instrument. He's been great when guided by directors with vision: Altman, Stoppard, Greenaway (!). Here he tries to make up for lack of depth by increasing the energy.

I came to this not because of Roth or Tarantino, but because of two of the women in the first episode. Alicia Witt played brief by extraordinary roles in 'Dune,' and 'Liebstraum.' Sammi Davis was in a Ken Russell film I had seen, 'Lair of the White Worm.' Russell is like Tarantino except without the luck in stumbling into a niche of palatable self adulation. In that film, she outshone the project.

But alas, the actresses are now both off my watch list.

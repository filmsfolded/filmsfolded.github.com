Shucks. I thought for the first 45 minutes that I had found a Denzel Washington film that was right for him and worth watching in ways he helps. 

Mixing Kung Fu and Jesus is alarmingly common, but this seemed more pure, more cinematic than most -- something of "Last Man Standing" meets "Canticle for Leibowitz."

That latter was the first serious science fiction I read and am primed for things like this. But then...

Gary Oldman starts to go slippery crazy; "the girl," the obligatory girl is introduced and Denzel (who controlled the script) goes all Sunday School on us. 

To appreciate what an opportunity has been lost, you need to have been properly exposed to Last Man and Canticle. They matter.

Incidentally, one is reminded that for some reason Denzel never learned how to convey pain. This works for the film from the beginning up until he stares down the chief henchman. After that, he needs to change, and he does. But it is only back to his drum major self!

Ten years ago, the Hughes brothers made a similar mess that charmed with that initial promise that the style would carry us into dangerous places. Maybe some day they will succeed. But not here.

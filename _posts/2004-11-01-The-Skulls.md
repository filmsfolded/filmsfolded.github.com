Spoilers herein.

Story number 6: Small guy, big guy. Small guy is compromised but prevails through his purity.

Variation 3: Shuffle a story about friends: who is your friend, who not? Works best for kids.

Twist B: at the end a bad guy turns sorta good and a bad guy sorta kinda good.

The only mildly interesting thing here is the video within the movie.

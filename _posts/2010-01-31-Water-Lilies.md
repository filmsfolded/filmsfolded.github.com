Perhaps the most crowded genre is the "coming of age" drama. It is also, I believe, the most abused. It is hard to do something important, something other than twisting basic experiences we all had.Breillat matters to me because she has guts, Campion because she is a poet. I expect tomorrow to be changed by "Innocence."

This is too ordinary to register. Sure the girls are engaging, and the fear of being real enough. But it is just too ordinary.

The extra gimmick here is a swimming pool, girl's locker room, trim and not so trim bodies is suits, and the commitment to a synchronized swimming team. The metaphor is just too heavy.

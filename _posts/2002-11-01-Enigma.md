Spoilers herein.

Gosh, I waited for this eagerly. Tom Stoppard is the best screenwriting weaver of self-referential work. Kate Winslet is one of our finest actors who knows how to play multiple layers simultaneously and who also understands how to cross time shifts.

Northam is less brilliant, but has been snappy with some Wilde material that plays with text. Saffron is queen of the musky images. The story is (even minus Alan Turing) one of the richest in all the history of the world in terms of the thing and the representation of the thing.

What went wrong?

In fact, the script is great. The problem is Apted, who is oblivious to the possibilities for manifolding studded into the script. Watch Kate struggle with an inept bureaucracy of the film while she does the same in character. Watch as they both (the Bletchley and Jagger crowds) make provision for genius without understanding it.

I am into pairing films for viewing. This one goes with 'A Bridge Too Far,' in terms of the poles of British competence in the War.

Despite the clumsy filmmaking, and the thuggish score, and the laconic editing this is still worth seeing. But you must decode it to see the gem of a film that is hidden in there.

My one fault with the decoded film is that it lacks a visual mapping of the mathematical/geometric vision some of these guys had. 'Beautiful Mind' tried and botched it bigtime. What we need is Greenaway and Nyman.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

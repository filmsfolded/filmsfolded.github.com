Spoilers herein.

Superficially, this is simpleminded TeeVee fare. One layer deeper, it is a story made up on  a train by the writer of simpleminded TeeVee fare. 

But under that layer is a rather clever exploitation of the archetypical self-invented life  story: 'Alice in Wonderland.' I'm amazed at how many scripts leverage this. Here we have  a simple reference: the little girl is the Disney Alice: long blond hair, blue dress and white  knee socks. She let's us know (actually the authoress lets us know) that Alice is being  referenced, because Annie is literally reading it.

And we have the notion of dreams as stories as reality, and also the drawings that aren't  remembered. Plus the rather esoteric use of the Baptistry whose huge brass doors depict  an early Alice.

Furmann is an intelligent actor who already did one of these folded fiction/metaphor  films for Tom Twyker.

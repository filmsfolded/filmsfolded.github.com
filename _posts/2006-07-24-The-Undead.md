Sure this is cheap, and sure the whole enterprise hangs on two pairs of costumed breasts. The devil. Time travel through hypnosis. Some very puzzling and complex causal mechanics, if you actually pay attention.

Corman tries to make sense, which is why In these sorts of things I always prefer Franco.

A woman is hypnotized and sent back in time. Ancient witchcraft intermingles with modern witchcraft, both represented by sexually open women. Two men "observe" and one goes back in time as well. The devil himself gets involved.

There's lots of interesting stuff here if you are a watcher -- a few things about us as watchers both being in the thing watched and twisting the mechanics of what happens. Its a noir thing, that notion of the world bending to be interesting for the viewer and harming people in that world.

So you may find it mildly interesting. But really, if you are at all interested in this you'd do better with Jess Franco.

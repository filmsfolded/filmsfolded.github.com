After about 50 Gang shorts, you fall even more back on formula than before.

This time, it is a "folded" story. This is a movie about kids making a movie. The movie we see and the movie they make is blurred, and both are blurred with "real" movies which are referenced at the beginning.

This is three years before "Citizen Kane," but when "Sullivan's Travels" was being filmed.

Its less funny than the early stuff just because it is so routine.

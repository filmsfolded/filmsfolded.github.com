I tracked this down because of its celebrity. Isn't that why we come to most movies?

The celebration in this case was that it was extremely successful in its country of origin, Sweden. It was supposed to be honest, true, direct.

I must say that Swedes interest me. I carry some of the blood that binds them together, and much of the overriding sense of obligation to self. It seems however that I have escaped the notion that God places heavy parts of the world in your way to grind you to cleanliness.

Swedish film interests me because I'm interested in noir, where it came from, why we invented it and how it governs lives now. Noir to me is the notion that the story of life is altered by observation to fit storypatterns, that humans bend to apparently irrational tracks to follow story. Its a human-imposed fate of sorts. that comes from "explaining" the world. Luther's notions live in Sweden. Bergman's films are intended to purify through pain and are a kind of antinoir.

Anyway, that's why this interested me. Its a teen film, a simple arc, a simple event: two girls seeking some way out of the small vessels that constrain. Its done "naturally," in the camera eye, in the way the story ambles and touches no storypoints. And in the simple, clear acting style of the main character who plays Agnes.

Its a huge disappointment. I can only explain its Swedish success in terms of the small escape from the constraints of Swedish film it represents. The girls DO escape at the end. Its a small victory for Swedes and I suppose small steps outside the gates are important, breezy ones. But in spite of the otherwise natural nature of the thing, the end is as contrived and "happy" as any Sandra Bullock pap from Hollywood.

I'm comparing it to other film experiences. "My Summer of Love" was along these lines but rewarding, illuminating. We see some of the walls. We don't end feeling pandered to. Oh, there are a few such: "Julien Donkey-Boy,; "Bully," even "Fun."

I suppose the story about the movie is as worthwhile as the movie would be if it were worthwhile. Perhaps you should see "Italian for Beginners" and then this, to get a feel for how bound Scandinavian stories are, and how escape from story forms its own story.

Spoilers herein.

By now you probably know that meat of this is quite ordinary. It has an 'its all a joke' sort  of scooby-doo ending. And this casts the whole thing retrospectively as a spoof of the  genre. Not particularly interesting on that basis alone.

But consider the beginning. When you stick close to a genre, often the only space you  have to play is the beginning, including the titles. This beginning is great, sophisticated  filmmaking.

It features a film-within-the-film (a video) which turns out to be a joke. You have the  dragging mannequins. You have the joke of the jack in the box, which sets up the final  twist and also lets you know that this girl is not a twin and that she is a little strange.

I was impressed. The rest is the result of an unpromising genre chummed out by weak  production talent.

If the denouement were as cleverly engineered, it would be a good film.

One thing about this film is interesting. The girls are all attractive, and represent different  high school stereotypes without resorting to the flapping boobs.

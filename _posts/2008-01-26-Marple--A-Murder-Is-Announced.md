I liked it. I particularly like the general approach these folks are taking precisely because they change things. They change the era and some characters to suit. They changed Miss Marple into someone with a history. They changed the events to be a bit snappier.

All this in the service of transporting radically uncinematic books to the screen. 

Yes, its different, but the changes I think are in the service of maintaining the Christie flavor while all else bends because of the introduction of a single eye, a single pipeline for us to get information. If you read the book, this particular one, you'll notice that it is all about sight and what is thought to have been seen. Every clue, every kink, every device has to do with sight.

Then if you watch the Hickson version, you'll note that although her character is entertaining, the mystery just doesn't work.

These sorts of things have to get quite a few steps right to succeed. 

First is to find a lode of notions that are stylish (so you can actually show them) and that drive the identity of a counterculture (so you have an audience base).

Then you have to create a cosmology, a system of forces and laws, then groups representing and manipulated by them. Again, you need both the core notions and the means to communicate them.

The first movie had these overlain on our own reality. Beings that live amongst us as humans have double identities as one or the other warring factions. This was a powerful notion, allowing for transmutations and symbol-laden clothing. I thought the movie very well put together up until this point, but failing dramatically in the actual visuals. 

The visual imagination of the thing was simply juvenile and the charisma of the heroine limited to the glisten of thighs. 

Now they decided to forgo the overlap of beasts and humans, and just depict the war between the two factions. Humans -- real, ordinary ones -- appear only in the slightest of contexts, though there is a lot of talk about keeping things hidden from them. The action is all between warring individuals. The twists in the story are several. They all have to do with family dysfunction, so clearly the writers understood their target audience.

I could have gotten into this. I like style, and excess when it is cinematically centered. Yup, I'll sit through and enjoy anything that has visual oomph. That's why I actually enjoyed the similarly position "Lord of the Rings" stuff. But this isn't cinematic. Not even a little.

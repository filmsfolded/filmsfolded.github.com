This is a magnificently successful film, I think. Its one of the best films of a book that I know, in the sense that it is a good film and its story comes from a book. I liked it, well, perhaps for the last couple minutes.

But it misses the tone of the book. Austen invented irony in the novel and that has been reincarnated in film as noir. Its perhaps the single most prevalent characteristic of narrative today, with incredible elaborations. Irony is inflationary, and the effects that could be subtle then, don't work at all now, and surely not through something like cinema.

At the same time, film is a tighter medium than literature. There's simply less conceptual room for narrative layers, and in film they have to be more close in terms of the way they are conveyed. (Music is at the other end, even roomier.) This means that if you want to convey rich irony in film, there are fewer choices in terms of key features. More devices but fewer features.

That makes the essence of Austen a bit of a challenge to convey in film. The 2005 "Pride and Prejudice" decided to use spatial layers and I thought that was a clever choice. It wasn't novel, copied from "My Brilliant Career," but it was a solution. What this film has decided to do is transmute the story into a Dickensian form. The characters don't constrain reality, not even the vile Lady Russell. They are instead characters that exist in reality. The irony in Austen was that she had both sides: society and persons constraining each other, and the irony being in how each gets it wrong.

Here, the odd characters are merely odd or colorful. That makes them entertaining of course, in the Dickens mode. But it pulls the legs out from the ironic dynamics.

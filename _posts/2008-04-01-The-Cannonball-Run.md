Yes I actually chose to see this. Its a mess of a movie, mere life filler from a period where cars could be characters.

The idea was the allow the episodic to become extremely fine grained, and to shift things so quickly that if one thing wasn't amusing, there was always something else around the corner before you could develop impatience. (This was when that lag time was longer than now.)

I watched it because Burt Reynolds is a fascinating actor. He really is a serious actor who mastered that notion of straddling the line between character and buddy of the audience. Clooney occupies this space now, Willis before him.

I saw Reynolds recently in an amazing experimental film by Figgis, and also in the "included footage," where he asks questions about where that line is supposed to be. (Answer: you decide.) It reminded me that we once thought he would be an important actor.

Watch him here. There is essentially no acting challenge, no real character or story. Watch how he fills the space. Its pretty interesting, possibly affected by what we know of his romance with Sally Field, another one in this category.

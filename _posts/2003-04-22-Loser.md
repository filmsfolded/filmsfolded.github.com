Spoilers herein.

I suppose this story will never die: spirited young girl makes an enthusiastic mistake in love and eventually finds 'true' happiness elsewhere.

In fact, I suppose that already an intelligent viewer can track all sorts of changes in society purely through how this female role is portrayed. The edition in this film is heartbreakingly sweet, perfectly groomed to a glossy punk and has some indication of an inherent intelligence that is never shown. All young actresses have to wade through these roles, and one can get some measure of their future in how they approach it as actresses. Mena's vixen has no irony at all, no actor's guile. She plays the sweetness straight, and wears the clothes well. She lacks a complete commitment to the part, and that hampers her portrayal of commitment to the perfesser.

Most of all, she seems wholly unintelligent as an actress. As with many such fables, the preying man here is a professor of literature, a figure nearly as common as the confused waif. The preference for literary figures has long been a foundation for self-reference in film: the 'literary' creations discussed folding into the nature of the film ('Wonder Boys' snaps to mind). In such cases, it behooves an intelligent actress to display some annotative display outside of her character. 

Nothing here. Instead, she is a simple redhead, an aDORAble diamond. The director's daughter, also a redhead plays a minor role, in fact there are many cameos and redheads here.

Gosh. The Spanish were able to turn religion against the world and have a hundred year party starting in 1550. (Its why Al Quaida has them at the top of the hate list.) The Irish have the same religion, but they somehow managed to turn it against themselves and destroy what should have been a leading civilization. 

Here we have an extremely well constructed film that registers some of the pain involved There's one scene that will stick with you for weeks: a crazed nun uncontrollably beats a girls for speaking to an "outsider." That outsider is the sister of an inmate who periodically brings the inmate's son by for a glimpse. The girl being beaten simply wanted to let the girl know her sister had been transferred to the loony bin for revealing a priest was raping her. This has power.

Missing from the history the film gives is the fact that many of the detainees were victims of molestation and incest, still rampant today in Ireland. And all the nuns are drawn from the pool of detainees, which is why the nuns here are so damaged.

But no movie exists outside of the context of other movies. And this one is burdened by every women's prison movie, movie about Irish religious disasters, and any movie about nuns. In recognition, one of these even appears in a way that doesn't advance the story directly. Unfortunately, this movie works because it mines what worked in the best of those previous projects. It is as if elements from the world of film were kidnapped and sequestered here to metaphorically clean our laundry.

Quite apart from the burdens of the film which keep it from being important, there is a great performance here: the simple girl played by Eileen Walsh. Heartbreaking, her last scene.

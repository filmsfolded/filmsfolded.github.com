What's interesting about 30's mysteries is their variety. The business in partnership with viewers were working out the few modes that would survive. Today we are stuck with only a few of the possibilities; everything else feels wrong because of the expectations we bring to them.

Its not important that this detective is yet another well known white actor in Chinese makeup. What's important is how complex is the mystery, how much we learn as viewers before the detective does (nothing), and how the solution is unrolled at the end.

The notable thing here is how complex the plot is. It is every bit as complex as the Perry Mason things that would come only a little later. But it is ever so much more difficult for us because they've experimented with hiding critical details. If you watch this with modern sensibilities, you'll be baffled.

The setup is a great one, folded of course: the murder happens during a game of charades where the actors are acting out a mystery, and the audience is guessing but has no clue.

Sweet, that. But otherwise, watch this only if you are a student.

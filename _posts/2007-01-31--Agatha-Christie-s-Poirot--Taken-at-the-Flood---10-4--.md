Regular readers of mine probably get tired on me dissing the Suchet Poirots.

They started out adopting the standard BBC model of entertainment regardless of their original shape and advantages. Poirot became a funny, endearing little guy, surrounded by comic -- and therefore endearing -- characters. The mysteries had no detection that we could participate in. All in all, something of a palatable sacrilege.

This one, I would like to recommend to you, though. It is cinematic. It is intelligent. It has range and movement. It keeps the stock parlor unveiling of murder, but modified. 

Be forewarned, it does radically alter some key dynamics, but at least this was all done intelligently. The folks involved in this knew what the genre was about, how cinematic detective narrative works, and what they wanted to accomplish.

So I'd like to suggest you watch it, then browse through the comments here to see how upset fans have become. The complaints are of two types. Its easy to dismiss those that miss the light comedy of the earlier versions. They were never interested in the pleasures of what Christie could do with the various interweaving fingers of world and discovery. All they wanted was the sunny, light amusement of the early projects.

Much more interesting are those that object to a change in the story that was much more than a shift in a plot detail.

Spoilers follow.

Poirot lives in a different world than Miss Marple does. The two series differ in fundamental ways, much deeper than a shift in detective. Marple lives in a world of small people with small, selfish horizons. In her stories you'll find her solving mysteries by comparing what she sees to some dynamic she's "studied" in her local village. Poirot's world is different. It is a world of rich pleasures and powerful souls, the mix of the two producing deep crime. Poirot's world is a world of evil, where the detective works to put things back in order. For Poirot, addressing evil is as much a matter of seeking order as are his obsessions elsewhere, for instance that his two breakfast eggs be exactly the same size.

So.

Christie's notion of evil is that powerful souls follow opportunities as they arise to serve their selfish ends. It means that accident is always a key factor in these Poirot mysteries. The players (not all the evil persons are murderers) are manipulated by fate, choosing paths as they go. Its an essential part of her storytelling because the detective (and us) is presented with the challenge of not only understanding the mind of the murderer, but the dynamics of fate that interweave with it. Evil by itself is easy. Usually, midway Poirot will announce that he has deciphered the evil person and motive, but not the events.

In the original, the explosion that happens before the proper story begins, is the real mystery. The murders that happen during the story are a sort of blind, the real mystery being tied to that explosion. In the book, it is an accident, and evil appetite seizes the opportunity. In this film, the bad guy isn't a Christie villain who is entangled with fate and acts with agility. He is a Holmes villain who has a plan and has manipulated reality to satisfy his master goals.

Its a radical change, radical. Yes, it takes us away from the magic of Christie. But for the first time it gives us a good Poirot movie.

So now it is time to mention the actresses. Absolutely superb. Think. Jenny Agutter in a minor role?

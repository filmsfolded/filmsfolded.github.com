I came to this with high expectations because its got a lot of promising things to work with. The composer is esteemed and when for this to that much celebrated Coen Brothers film. The cinematographer is well known for thinking large. The director created something extraordinary in "Secretary." It has two interesting actors. But most of all it is a work of art about an artist, and that's often interesting.

And this particular artist is someone noteworthy, even controversial. Its because she was born and married into that privileged set (insert your characterization here) that consumes commercial art. They, therefore, sometimes "turn" into artists as part of the market pull that determines what is art, what is interesting, what matters.

This particular case deals with photography, which has always been something a bit strange, especially when the images are of people, and people in natural poses, at rest. In other words, images of people that would be similar to what you would see in ordinary encounters with the real world. Arbus focused on people from "the fringes of society." If you review the actual photographs, there's nothing special in the technique, nothing special in the way the medium is handled. The "art" is all in the subject matter, excepting for the square format which is supposed to "erase the frame," and thereby emphasize the subject. 

Needless to say, this is a provocative notion. Somehow the choice of taking the picture reifies the thing as essential. You can take this several ways. After all, this was in the heyday and vicinity of painters and sculptors who celebrated the ordinary. But that didn't have the privileged stance of blessing "otherness." Somehow, in some way, the art is more in who the artist is and why she would choose to involve us in this petty exploitation. That story, the story that surrounds each story of her photos, is what made this potential prime viewing time. 

Couple that with what we know of these two actors. Downey likes to get weird. He likes to become strange in some way, and then incidentally show it in ordinary behavior. Kidman is a completely different sort of actor. She's all about showing a self. Her characters are about what you are meant to see, not what she grows in herself and incidentally shows. She has made a specialty of showing characters who see things in the story. Yes, review her key films to see what I mean. 

So. If you just come to this without that background, I am sure you will experience a pretentious, pointless exercise with an evocative score. But with that background, the thing reverses itself. We see a weak soul, a simple woman, and unartistic mind in a sea of similarly useless people. We see her grasp a mildly interesting community to give her life "meaning" simply because they pass within reach. She's no artist, she's an accident. The interesting thing about this is how it makes us into the same sort of useless voyeur. And how empty and dirty it makes us feel. How embarrassed of selves we are.

And isn't that art?

Incidentally, it has some technical folding. When she recalls her childhood, she replays a very literal movie of it, or sees explicit photos. There's some too-precious stuff about running from fur into fur, and from sex into sex, and (we know) from suicide into suicide.

Not all worthwhile experiences are noble, I fear.

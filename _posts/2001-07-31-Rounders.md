Spoilers herein.

This is an odd film: admirable in some ways, but a failure overall.

The admirable: Malkovich has never been better (as good here as 'Killing Fields'). Turturro, Norton and Landau are fine actors who do well. Damon is a second-rater, but he does his best work here. I think that is a matter of casting -- the film is a reinvented 'Will Hunting,' and Damon is cast as someone who doesn't know how to act.

On the other hand, in the service of setting a noir tone the women here are treated not as characters but as elements in the background of life that 'real people' stumble through. This is as cheap as using voyeuristic nudity and equally offensive.

The thing that struck me was how lazy was the writer, how closely he followed the 'Will Hunting' scaffold.

In both, we end with a sympathetic young prodigy leaving town and a misspent life to fulfill his real genius. What makes this better is that Will was about math genius and never showed an understanding of the magic and pain that accompanies that world. Here it is a slightly different type of genius, softer but more obsessive. Although 'Oscar and Lucinda' did a deeper job, we do get a feel for what is involved and how obsession necessarily follows, and this is no 'Grifters.'

In Will, we had three men who interact with Will to braid the story: a long-time childhood friend, a highlevel professor and an advisor who triggers the story. One tempts the hero into an unhealthy expression of his gift, one prompts him to 'follow his heart' by giving a very personal and tragic story, and one provides nearly unqualified and admiring support. In this film, we have the same three types with the roles shifted. The writer's simple musical chairs.

'Will Hunting' was an excrescence. This is better because of the talent of those three actors and because the director wisely targets the tragic dark pull of the obsession. But the film doesn't deliver.

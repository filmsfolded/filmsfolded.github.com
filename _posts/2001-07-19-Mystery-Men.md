Spoilers herein.

This thing really grows on you. It has style and charm both, despite the popular trappings. It has some superb performers that are free to do their thing. Three rather pleasant and talented women. Two things in particular:

--The sets are Gaudi-based, or as Gaudi would make them in the pessimistic 30's. Frankenstein's mansion is not quite as impressive as the mansion in Casper. But it is worth the price of viewing for that alone. So few films have competent set design, design that supports a coherent stylistic notion, much less an intelligent notion. It is bizarre, and it works.

--We have here Stiller and Garafalo, just after doing 'Permanent Midnight,' carrying the same intensity, but here as self-parody. She's a gem, who knows how to control her environment without you knowing.

In fact all the actors are not spoofing past hero movies so much as spoofing acting styles. This is the only forum where when you put actors in charge, you don't get a mess, you get fun. And it is pretty intelligent fun if you ignore the words.

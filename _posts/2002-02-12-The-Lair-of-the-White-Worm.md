Spoilers herein.

Ken Russell makes the assumption that you are exceedingly dull, so explains every joke, even wrapping the simplest formulaic device in endless exposition. A skilled watcher will dig below his horizon.

Luckily, we have the character Mary. She is played by Sammi Davis, who actually has some depth as an actress, and who seems to envelop this vision in her own. Some of that may be deliberate in her Virgin Mother character, but most -- it seems -- is because she is so much more intelligent than the filmmaker.

There's danger in following this thread -- you can get lost in the higher layers of pagan mesmerism. But after a few viewings, you can see that she is the real master of the petty destinies here.

This takes more skill to watch than the recent two "Scary Movie" projects.

That's because they work on the principle that the original movies they refer to are inherently ridiculous. We readily agree with that assumption -- most of us -- and so they work.

But date movies are joined deeper in the psyche. We really do believe in romance. Its deeper than religion, deeper than self in most cases. So even though the movies are just as ludicrous, we don't grant it.

Its easier to do when the joke is one that honors romance. The second "Charlie's Angels" was great fun in the segments that did this. But this movie is based on the "Scary Movie" template that has no respect for the sources.

So you have to be ready to let them go. You have to be prepared to laugh not at the movie, but at yourself for every sweet emotion you had when watching the originals.

If you can, you'll like this. I did. The jokes themselves aren't so funny. That doesn't matter. What matters is the relationship between the jokes and the original sources. You have to have seen a lot of movies, well over a hundred I guess, to get this. But the stuff comes so fast and is integrated so well, its great fun.

Its sort of a reverse folding. The point of folded narrative is usually to get the viewer in the movie somehow so as to increase the effectiveness of the storytelling. Here you already are in the story (because you believe in romantic love) and this pulls you out.

Oh and our heroine is redheaded.

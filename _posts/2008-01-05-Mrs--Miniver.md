I have a problem with "message" movies. These are movies where there is a simple value or point the filmmaker wants us to get. Its going to be more of an exercise in convincing than engaging, more about slanting than exposing, more about him/her and less about us.

Its at least interesting with "christian" movies which are often about a fight with the devil, and are considered by the filmmaker to be a fight with that very same devil. Its less interesting with "documentaries" which are geared toward educating us. But its absolutely repellent when all the tools of fiction are turned toward making us have a particular political opinion. 

These sorts of issues are behind every film, of course. Each film assumes a certain set of principles and laws of the presented world. And they certainly do change us. But its an inside out sort of thing in the best of them. Its when its the only intent, the only value, the only thing attempted and delivered that offends. Now in this case, it passes because it had Hitler to justify it. But it shouldn't; its smarmy business when its attempted.

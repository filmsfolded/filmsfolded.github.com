Spoilers herein.

Well we've seen about a movie a month for the last 18 months dealing with battling the devil. This film isn't as bad as 'Omega Code,' but then what is? This is horrible enough though, and the reason they thought they could get away with it --they HAVE in fact made money -- is because such films have entered the realm of commodity.  What that means is that there are enough premanufactured parts and premanufactured audience perceptions that all it takes is a lesser craftsman to satisfy the formula by simple assembly..

Great films can invent parts of society. Commodity films mirror parts of the society that are mature, reducable and thoroughly premarketed. What's depressing about this is that it successfully exists as a commodity. It says that fundamentalists and political consultants have succeeded in reducing the world of many people to the simplest dynamics of good and evil; a simplicity so profound that the mere appearance of code words mitigates the need for a story, for acting, indeed for any cinematic skill whatsoever.

If anyone is reading this and considering seeing 'Bless,' please don't. It says too much about the dumbing down of society. If you are looking for a more intelligent film of this type, see 'Ninth Gate.'

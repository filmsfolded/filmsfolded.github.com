What a spectacular mess. Goldie's daughter never had any appeal, and here she is at her worst. She's what they say out of her box, outside the perky character she plays.

This could have been fun, in a "Cutthroat Island" sort of way.

But the only interesting feature I could find in this was the Gemma character, played by someone named Alexis Dziena. Granted, the character is probably easy to play, the ditsy daughter. But its rather amazing that with these two supposed stars, she is the one that actually connects. She's a sort of Sally Field type, sparkling.

I am convinced that at some point soon, there will be a market for reassembled films like this, improved by folks at home using prosumer tools. I think that this possibly could be improved by using only the shots we see. We'd probably cut a lot of what's her name and the guy too when he is trying to be comedic with her. This means that we'd have to introduce some narration.

But it would allow some clever fellow to give this thing a visual pulse.

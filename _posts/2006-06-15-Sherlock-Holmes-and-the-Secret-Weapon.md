Holmes was an icon of sorts to Victorian London. He represented relentless logic and in a way was the model for the man of the future. Its no wonder that he was coopted and placed in wartime Britain. They needed every weapon they could muster and a logic beyond justice that served justice was more than apt.

The original Watson was an honorable Englishman, a man of science who could only observe, our fold in the narrative. The wartime Watson was a bumbler, a buffoon, still a representative of the average Brit who thought of themselves that way.

Here we are, here is where we want to be.

In the original stories, there was a tension between the supernatural and logical, between fate and human-lubricated justice. Eventually, Doyle satisfied the conflict by creating Moriarty. He was an equally brilliant manipulator, a demigod based on logic but evil logic. Rather, logic turned to evil needs.

Holmes would see him as an equal, but the average man would simply know that he controls -- actually directs -- ALL the crime in London, which is to say the world. He's fate. He's supernatural, or seems so. Just killing him is enough to allow Holmes to raise from the dead.

So. No wonder we see him here as Hitler's man.

Other than following these twists, the Rathbone Holmeses are horrible: poor storytelling, poor film-making. The later wartime ones are the worst. This may be the worst.

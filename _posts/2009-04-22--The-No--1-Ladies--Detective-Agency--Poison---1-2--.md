When do exploitative stereotypes become offensive and when endearing? When they are generated outside of the target community for profit? What about when they reinforce what is seen by the target community as deeply intrinsic to the culture?

Supposing that you do not know this...

It is a cheaply produced set of artificially simple "African" fables. The chief character is a bossy, obese black woman with what is proudly called "a traditional shape." Her assistant is obsessively dedicated and daft, clearly a number two. All the men are nitwits, pompous or self-effacing. The "mysteries" are simply an excuse for our number one lady to poke around and to "explain" at the end to the collected characters, Agatha Christy-style.

This is where the manufactured wisdom comes from. Where the standard mystery would have the guilty revealed and reviled, our wise woman spends most of her time explaining why the bad events happened. Culpability is diminished and wisdom about how to repair lives is doled out.

I found it not only trite, but offensive. I imagine that few others will until a few years have passed and the idea of "ethnic identity" matures past this sort of fable.

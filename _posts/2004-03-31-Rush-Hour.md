Spoilers herein.

I'm a Jackie Chan fan. I really enjoy how he has expanded the film vocabulary with  choreographed fight humor. But all his best work seems to have been done before he  tried Hollywood. This is first try at working out a formula. It squarely confronts the  culture clash thing by introducing the international symbol of super-America, the flippant  Blank. 

But it has almost nothing of what he's good at, save a short bit with a steering wheel. All  of the various devices are trotted out on schedule: the little girl, the British aristocrat  behind the cruel mercenary, the jive singing...

About the only tolerable thing here is a pretty strong showing by Elizabeth Pena. The  sequel was better, but I'd recommend looking at projects older than this.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3 -- has some interesting elements

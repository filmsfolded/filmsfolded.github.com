What an indigestible mess! I'm not talking about the story. 

My only experience with Fruit Chan was "Public Toilet." It was a very successful movie for me. It sketched an open world -- unending quests, open characters, like we find in life. The forces we see are those of death postponed, recycled. Sure, it introduced a coprophagiac mermaid and such notions, but the thing had a kind of life; elements passed by one another and through and by these motions it defined life.

So imagine my expectation for this project that combines such a promising a filmmaker with the most interesting cinematographer working today. Doyle has the ability to create an inner animation, a pulse of the retina's veins, within the vision of the filmmaker -- if he has a vision.

But this project has a closed world. Its a simple narrative, completely unlike "Toilet," except for being unreal. Less so but in the same magical direction. There are three main characters: a wealthy man, his aging wife (a former actress), and a sort of magical witch doctoress who serves up the dumplings that reverse aging. (Actually, it merely enhances the body for sex, an interesting substitute.)

The story actually matters here: we have to invest in these characters, where the "Toilet" characters were tokens, moving bits of a larger machine. So we expect the story to give value as a story. It doesn't. What it does is set up a few scenes: three athletic sex scenes, one abortion and the penultimate scene which is intended to be the most disturbing. But because we have no human connection to the thing it loses the effect.

There's one interesting device. Lots of energy is spent in hearing the eating of the dumplings. We also hear the noises of bodies joining. Its quite shocking -- explicit, and obviously deliberate as the sex scenes are staged in such a way that there is less to watch than film convention usually provides, so you notice this sound. They are pretty much the same, the dumplings and the copulation.

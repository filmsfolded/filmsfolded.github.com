Spoilers herein.

Wes Craven is no dummy, he just acts like one. But slyly behind the scenes he does some clever stuff. Ordinary viewers of the first and seventh 'Nightmare' will be secure in knowing what is a dream and what not. But -- especially in the seventh where the dreams merge with his own writing -- this is not so clear. Perhaps the whole thing is a dream. Perhaps the whole thing is the private hell of Krueger's soul.

Same here. Superficially we have a dumb voodoo movie, which shamelessly (but honestly) exploits racial stereotypes. But look closer. Which is the vision and which not? I prefer the ambiguity of the first spell encompassing the whole film. No reason why not. No reason this is not the prolonged vision of a man going mad in a coffin.

This film flopped, and deservedly so. It tries something that is common enough, and often rewarding. It's the notion of being inside and outside at the same time, usually in the form of cleaving to some societal value and making fun of it at the same time. It works best it seems in teen movies where the audience is both the target and the consumer.

Here, it is the consumer of romantic comedies that is the intended butt. Its a workable idea, I think. And Adam Sandler has shown that he can support similar endeavors, ones based on introspective acting where the actor is portrayed as a tentative.

But they miscalculated in hewing to the formula too closely in some respects (the juvenile humor) and deviating too far; the fact is that though gays are portrayed sympathetically in some places, in the States its exceedingly rare that its considered incidental, ordinary. That's the way it would be if this film were real. 

Like so many other film failures, they want to have it both ways but without inventing a new edge on which to balance. 

One thing worked, sorta. That balance between a movie version of the Village People and the movie version of the hero. There are three moments where this was balanced delicately. I suppose they were the three scenes pitched.

Otherwise, it is what it is about: a sham.

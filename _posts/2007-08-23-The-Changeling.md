This is close to being a good movie, but for me it isn't close enough. What it has to recommend it is a real plot outside of the spooky stuff, so we don't have to rely on simple terror. That terror is conveyed the way we like, without resorting too much on the startle, or repulsive, gory violence. In theory, it should be more effective as a result. It also should be able to boast good actors. 

There are two chilling moments, both of which involve animated objects. The most chilling is the appearance of a ball that we know has been discarded. It happens early in the film, before the clumsy plot takes over and when we are still unfamiliar with the house ourselves. The second is at that period in the end where things get frantic and a woman is being chased by a small wheelchair. Its less effective because it does startle, and we know she is only in the story so that she can be in the fully awake haunted house alone at night.

But there are some serious flaws. The plot really is quite clunky in how it gets folks lined up in the situations we see. If the house is seen as "making things happen" supernaturally that wouldn't naturally, then the effect is emphasized by having the plot mechanics be natural. And the acting style as well: this surely isn't Scott's best. (His style was apt in "They Might be Giants.")

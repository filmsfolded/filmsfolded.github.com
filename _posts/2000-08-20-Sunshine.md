I yearn for ambitious, smart films even when they fail. This film is ambitious -- grandly so -- but it fails in an uninteresting manner. I would gladly tolerate the length (Branagh's Hamlet enchants at 4 hours), and I would tolerate the pandering to mirrored devices (broken cups) and other signs of poor writing if there was more intellectual substance.

Here's what I mean: the story mirrors sister-love, sister-in-law love (and another adultery); mirrors being oppressor and oppressed, tainted and true judgment, life and death and so on and on in very obvious ways. But these are mere details compared to the apparent main message: the dynamics of rejecting love, faith and ideals. But any power for illuminating any one of these is lost in the conflating of them together. 

One after another, the Fienes characters deny these each in order with the drama seemingly underscoring that the penalties for each are the same: that the commitment of one denial "curses" the world of the other. But it is all so murky in the dynamics. The only link is this much-mentioned dynamic of"curse." (This gets dangerously close to the slander that Jews were responsible for their own plight.) At some points, the director seems to push love/faith as the enduring value, then (including low smaltz at the end) faith. 

A lot of people went to a lot of trouble to make this film, and one must wonder what they thought they were creating. Great art of the type this tries for, has us leaving the theater pondering questions (while other types of film might go for assimilating the new experiences). But nothing is well defined here. Fienes was best in "Oscar and Lucinda" where he was confident in what he was about. He is obviously a great actor, but just as obviously is confused here about what he is to convey. Other actors in this film do well -- no, very well -- here too. And there are some nice sets, but much of this is ruined when sets are used twice for radically different purposes.

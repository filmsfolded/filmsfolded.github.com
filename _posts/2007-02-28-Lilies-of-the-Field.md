If you watch films lucidly, you encounter all sorts of ways that they reach you. 

I'm interested in these ways and how they interact, how they are layered. There are the ordinary things having to do with the actual storytelling and all sorts of metamessages about the nature of art and presentation.

And then in some cases, there's what we have here, a large movement by society to work things out in the storyworld of film as a statement, or desire.

Films are where we work out complex experiments with representation, cognition, introspection. They are also where we work out more accessible problems, like who we are in our romance, our nation and world. We select our film personalities in large measure because of how they reflect where we are. I strongly believe that in the industry, we have artists, real artists that drive these adventures, and celebrities that we select because they follow us.

This film is not from any of the artists. It follows society of the time. But it is a superb example of film being where we give ourselves permission as a society to go beyond where we think we are. This isn't quite the dynamic most people believe: that the film industry directs public opinion for better or worse, depending on whether your ox is gored. But whether you think this is a driver or a follower, its interesting.

For those who don't know (shame!) the US was in the midst of perhaps its greatest period of moral re-evaluation. It was a great, great time to be an American because great shifts began, instigated by questions at the root of the social contract. The appearance of this was after the big non-violent push of Martin King and before Congress passed extremely big laws protecting minorities.

There's a profoundly ordinary set of stereotypes here: the Mexicans who are witless followers of an imperial religion; the Nazi woman. (This still resonated then; it meant something negative to just be German, especially in the context of minorities and intolerance, and this woman played the stereotype to a T.)

And you had the cracker, the white guy, who calls the black man "boy," and later says he's "shiftless, you know the type."

Everyone here is rigidly a stereotype except for the black man. He's deliberately outside that snap to type, and it is why the thing was so profound in its time. Hard to believe now, but it WAS shocking to see a beautiful man, moving easily through the spaces these stereotypical characters created. He has no space himself, he's a wanderer and the space he does create (a chapel) is for others, to transform theirs.

This was after "Mockingbird" a dreary morality tale in the old mold and to my mind was much more influential. This allowed us to build a world with Richard Prior, Flip Wilson and Bill Cosby.

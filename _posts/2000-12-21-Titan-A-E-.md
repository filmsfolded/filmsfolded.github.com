What a failure! Many comments here say the same thing: some great visuals, but poor story. But the visuals are part of the problem as well. There's just no coherence. If the visual was coherent, it would make up for a thin story. Example: Titanic.

I think the lack of focus comes from a lack of understanding what science fiction is all about. It is not just taking contemporary characters and situations and plunking them into odd environments. Adding in anthropomorphic aliens and space ships doesn't count. What you need is to be projected into a world that is similar, but extrapolated. The strangeness should charm and prompt the imagination. When the production is purely animated, the possibilities are greater, which makes this a bigger disappointment than Lucas' recent folly.

Only the 'wake angel' segment is coherent, where the notions of extrapolation and image merge. Though the ice crystals and hydrogen planet are brilliant in the visual sense, they are not grounded in where they take our imagination. The lesson: visuals must be more than grounded in the dramatic -- in the imagination as well. I've noted this problem in other films where the actors' sensibility is correct dramatically but misses the fact that the center of the film is in the viewer's mind.

Think about the 'Star Wars' saga. It used deep religious archetypes (starting with the stuff of the viewer's mind). While it started with a story about government conflict, it morphed into familial conflict, our most deepseated emotions. A very clever placing of the center of the films in your own mind where your imagination can gloss over stuff like the thin plot, poor acting, etc. None of that here. It's why Pixar will win and these folks have already folded.

Other strangenesses: I suppose that they began with the notion of homage to all the prior space films. If so, over time they transformed this into simply borrowing existing cliches. How can you be new when you set the tone at the beginning that, for example, all the space ships you see here will be just like you expect them to look.

The girl here is clearly derivative of Disney's recent move into non-North European types, but with a larger bottom and harder face. Garofalano is the best actor, making the others seem thin. Did we really need the Yoda imitation? The innovation here is the moving camera. If they had just exploited that (instead of the five or six mere circular pans), it would have been worthwhile. In fact, the sole threeD character shot is at the end and it sort of sullies all the twoD stuff that has gone before. Daft.

The music (especially the pop tunes) have the same-same feel. Copies.

There are two ways of watching a movie for me. I can decide to participate, or if it doesn't seem promising for some reason, I can watch it for the craft. This is in the latter category. And it has two really interesting things to watch.

I like Bruce Willis. He's a superb technician, which is why he can do comedy and, say Harrison Ford cannot. Watch how he carries not only himself, but the space around him. A certain zen. Lilly Tomlin helps - she's great, more of an intuitive, but isn't used well here.

The other thing: the score here is elevated to the level of a major character. What's done is to use Disney's first rate expertise in personally dramatic music as surrogate for the viewer, and it is done well. Lots of cornets and bassoons. Real instruments, real voices in your head. When you do this, the music doesn't complement the action, it comments on it. It is in YOUR mind, not the world of the action. Very clever.

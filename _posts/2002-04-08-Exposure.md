Spoilers herein.

Boy what a mess. This writer director pulls from many formulas, but none enough to have any effect. there is the cloaked slasher, the Antonioni blowup photographer, the Hitchcock violin screeches, the mirrored twins, the mirroring with the dead wife, the multiple personality disorder, the exorcist priest.

Its as if this was made from outtakes from a studio's output.

I think the title is a triple pun: the nature of the photographer's work which here is mildly self-referential; the fulcrum of the plot device which 'exposes' a woman; and the exposure of us to so many idioms.

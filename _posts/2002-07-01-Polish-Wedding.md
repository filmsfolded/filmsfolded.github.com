Spoilers herein.

I believe this is a direct-to-video project. Sometimes that is because it is a gem but the audience is too costly to incubate. But sometimes it is because a project too obviously never comes together. 

In my experience, Danes shows more charm but less craft than Dunst. Dunst has slogged through the teen genre more or less competently, where she served as sweatermonkey, but she is learning. Danes on the other hand handled three intelligent roles by the time of this film: 'Women,' 'Juliet,' and (though the film was horrid) 'U-Turn.' She has appeal and energy. Lots of innocent charm, the kind many filmmakers like to exploit.

But that is not enough even for this drudge through minor drama. Watch for Danes to be more and more the broken or threatened innocent, like in Terminator 3.

Spoilers herein.

Though this is highly celebrated, I see too many flaws to make it work well.

Some key roles are broken because the approach the actors took: Malden, Saint, Pops. It seems overtly theatrical compared to what Steiger and Brando are doing. Those two are doing something relatively new: establishing a parallel conversation over the 'ordinary' work of portrayal. It has the most obvious effect of making the characterization 'real.'

Its often credited to some sort of inner connection via the 'method,' but that's not at all so. Meryl cannot; Dustin cannot. Only few have the gift: Marlon, Julianne, Kate, Sean. That's what makes this special, only Marlon's folded acting, supported by Rod's.

What else doesn't work? The cinematography tries to be 'classic,' the writing is after a theatrical model that - although it has some meaty scenes - follows too simple a dramatic shape. But the biggest problem is the score. This is good music. And I understand it was key to adding jazz to the realistic cinematic vocabulary. But the personality of this music is one dimensional. Its message is purely in the direct sounds, the communication. Its as if all the conversation were in the words and none in the accompanying body language.

Its okay, but Brando's work deserved something more dimensional. Only when the music is replaced by the waterfront sounds when Brando tells the girl does the composition of image and sound work. 

'Streetcar' is where you need to go for a project integrated with the Brando fold.

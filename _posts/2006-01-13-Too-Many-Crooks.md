Is there anything more puzzling than comedy? Anything that could tell us more about how we think and feel?

And is there anything more transparent than British comedy? At least the "Ealing" type British comedy that started just before the war and sputtered on until 1960 or so. I guess this would be one of the last.

Jokes about language, and similar jokes about the larger context of class abound in these things. Woven in is the notion of incompetence, usually the incompetence of typical Brits.

Here we have a rich man in the America tradition, meaning he has "privileges" but doesn't have class. And we have an incompetent bunch of "true" lowlifes. The story simply weaves the two in such a way that roles are reversed.

And, it IS funny, in a gently amusing way, at least for this American, viewing it 45 years later.

But it isn't funny enough for me to recommend it to you. It may be interesting if you want to kidnap some ideas about who you are. But beware, it may turn the tables on you.

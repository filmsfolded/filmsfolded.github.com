I suppose every society has something like this: a superficially manufactured product, targeted at clumsy boys (and sometimes girls) whose only intent is to assure them that their clumsiness is endearing. Don't grow up, it allows, you will find movie romance.

In this case, our dweeb stumbles upon a princess and each stumble and successive misstep brings him closer to her. He's honest and endearing you see. The narrative folding here (where the audience has an on screen equivalent) comes from his internet buddies. 

Presumably, most of these only know our hero through the chat room and have no idea what he is like in person. This rather numerous bunch get every detail reported to them just as we the "real" viewers see. They comment and encourage, just as we are meant to, cheering him on, giving him the courage to chase his dream and be fulfilled as a man. Its a simple narrative fold. The story and the point of the story are both revoltingly trite.

There is an interesting detail though. Among his internet buddies are three guys even more nerdy than he. They seem to live together, but only have a life on-line. The conflating of their online life with the story we see is odd: they shift into a war movie where the "advancement" of the romance is equated with advancing on a battlefield. Elsewhere, this is completed by others and even the girl encouraging our guy to "be brave."

This is no "All About Lilly Chow Chow," which I aggressively recommend. That is deep; this is not.

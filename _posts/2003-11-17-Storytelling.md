Spoilers herein.

Solondz is a modern Woody Allen. Both are obsessed with how film fiction and life  reinforce each other. But where Woody filled his empty spaces with love and gentle angst  about love in a slapstick context, Solondz cavorts darkly. He sees the penalties.

In both cases, most viewers really think the reason for the films to exist is the stuff used  as filler: that Woody's films for instance are about city life and love.

Nah. And many people will be similarly distracted here and comment on matters of race  and generational distance and various exploitations. Nah, again.

The very point is that we are so easily distracted and enmeshed in narrative that we  cannot tease out the mechanics of life from that of film. The notion of 'race' is a fiction  made real by popular art. The notion of sex in love as well. The notion of truth is a  deliberate fabrication of fiction in order to give itself power.

I give credit to Solondz. He hits the same sweet spot Woody often does by proving his  point by using that point to confound us. Where Woody entertains, Solondz distracts. 

Watch this only if you are interested in thinking about film.

'Safe' is a much more subtle and effective essay on this same matter. It actually enlists  the actress (the multilayered Moore) in the endeavor, something that Solondz apparently  cannot do.

'Death on the Seine' is more stimulating to my mind because it explores restoring  reality.

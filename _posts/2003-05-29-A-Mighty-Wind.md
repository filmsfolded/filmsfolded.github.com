Spoilers herein.

Guest has already earned two places in my film hall of fame, one each as innovator. He has invented a workable 'mockumentary' genre that is intelligent, wry, self-referential and gently destructive. He has also innovated in a certain kind of content: music that is so earnestly pure to form it satirizes that form by its mere existence. 'Spinal Tap' had difficulty finding an audience because many audiences couldn't tell the difference between the 'mock' band and real ones.

So in his next two projects, Guest synthesized these two new comic ideas in a clever way, by emphasizing the machinations before the show. These two projects are famous for their improvisational freedom; hundreds of hours were shot. Actors had great range in digging into Guest's new territory. Because some of those actors are very clever, we had some absolutely brilliant moments. Many of those included Guest himself. The show itself was just context.

Now here, we have gone back to Spinal Tap days. The show occupies much of the film, and is played so straight that even I (who am the right age for this nonsense) cried at the kiss. Its a delicious guilt but one we are not willing to value without the context of what goes before. Here is where he lets us down. There are three 'performance' stories and four 'management' stories (the TeeVee producer, show's producer, manager and public relations pair). The latter four are mere filler and are treated that way.

Its the performance of the performers where the payoff is supposed to be, but we go off in three different directions. Cowriter Levy goes off to create his own little sweet world, independent of the rest of the film and the central notion of the project. Its pretty well done, so weakens the enterprise. Guest's ownership is limited to the Folksmen and is exquisitely wry until a cheap sex change gag at the end. The remaining third likely had lots of clever bits, these 'New Main Street Singers.' But what we get here are some half-gags and the shadows of others.

Parker Posey is in this wasted lot. I would have sat through 3 1/2 hours of the rest to have allowed room for her bit, whatever it was. After seeing what she did in 'House of Yes,' I consider her the captain of this sort of nested irony. But she is reduced to a background here: dual red sailing ponytails and a speech about being on the street that doesn't have time to go anywhere.

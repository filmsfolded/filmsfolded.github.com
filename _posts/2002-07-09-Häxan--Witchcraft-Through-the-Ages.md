Spoilers herein.

I love old films. I love originality and genius. I greatly appreciate Eisenstein. But this film does not impress. It has two remarkable components, the photographic skill and the narrative structure.

The photography (including the whole production) is what is usually noted. It is skilled, and uses original techniques. But those techniques are paraded in front of us, and though nominally in service to the story, they seem to be 1922's edition of the 'Matrix' (or pick your favorite effects picture) phenomenon: impression by novel effects. There is no central notion of world. There is no soul to this vision.

The narrative structure is more interesting, though I do not think deliberately so. We have an illustrated lecture on hysteria exhibiting as witchcraft ending with some vapid moralizing on then-contemporary thinking on 'hysterical' women. Along the way we have:

-- Showing of drawings and diaramas, where each element discussed is patronizingly pointed to by the off-screen lecturer. Ultimately, these drawings become animated.

-- That animation then segues to various stagings of 'how mistakes were made' in different witchcraft scenarios. These are commented upon by the lecturer in the 'present,' who frequently reminds us how simple are the people. Included in this is a rather clever self-reference where the Bishop has the same pointer used earlier by Christensen (and Christensen plays the devil).

-- This transitions to a short segment like the first where devices of torture are described, with 'modern' actors demonstrating.

-- We end with a rather clever montage where the same actress we have seen in the 'modern' demonstrations reappears in some of the staged reconstructions and also in a similarly formed drama as a 'modern' hysterical. 

We are obviously supposed to understand that we are (or should be) in the place of the lecturer, that place where the actress stands when demonstrating the thumbscrew. And we are not on the other side where the medieval reconstructions, the modern parable and much of 'real life' exists. One can clearly see the intent, but it doesn't work because the images do not create enough otherworldy identity.

'Caligari' attempted precisely this same definition of two worlds with the same end-of-film blurring between the two. It succeeded because there was a coherent vision in defining and centering that other world. Not so here, though I am sure it stood as a template. I cannot consider this film of importance except to note some technical skill.

Spoilers herein.

Eastwood and Reynolds are masters of comic timing, especially of the laconic variety that would have lent itself well to noir satire. Alas, here some Hollywood genius decided to give us a faux noir, something that is part slapstick, part gritty seriousness. The result only succeeds in making unintended fun of itself.

Dreadful, dreadful waste of an opportunity.

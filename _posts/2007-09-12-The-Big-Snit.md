These small animations seldom work because of the big joke: here a couple arguing while the world is destroyed. Its the smaller side jokes that fill out the box that make it work. Here, our man gets distracted.

He is obsessed with sawing. The TeeVee show he watches in secret (folding joke there) is "Teen Sawing." Its a cartoon in a cartoon that is hilarious and of course it bleeds into the main cartoon. As things get more hectic, the man's sawing does. 

Its clever, and especially the notion that this obsession is carried by teen excess.

(Cat's eye comment...)

Nick Cage is in this movie somewhere. His role is to be the noir detective in a simple way. He thrashes about and hallucinates. He makes noise. There are some other colorless characters who do ordinary movie things.

The real center of this movie remains hidden except for a brief period at the beginning and end. Its a little girl, Rowan, the daughter that Nick Cage's character has but did not know of. She's independently the mystery. She is missing, and folks on the island seem to be covering up something. Also independently, she is a sort of magical presence who really does pull supernatural forces to make happen what we see.

She is the goddess who ruins the crops and ruins her father to save them. She is the one who long after she would have been born, wills herself into existence to trap him, even though he is not a believer. She is the one who can cause big things, disappear, carry evil and still seem charming (in a German sort of way). 

This is her story, her fire. Herself as her wan mother's infertile sex.

The differences between this remake and the original are all geared toward supporting her. Its an island controlled by women this time and there is this Bee Business. The girl has made herself his child this time. Previously, it was his Christianity that was his confusion. Now it is simply that he was chosen.

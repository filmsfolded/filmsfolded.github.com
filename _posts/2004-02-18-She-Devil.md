Spoilers herein.

This trivial timewaster has one element worth watching: Meryl Streep relaxed. She has power  and focus, but when she tries hard, you can often see her trying. She sometimes gets around  this by trying in the manner that her character would try (if she were an actress).

Here - uniquely so in my experience - she just relaxes, and the result is fascinating. Her  mannerisms are much more theatrical than her normally controlled self. She acts large. And  in so doing, you can see all the basic moves she has. These are suborned and melded into  her characters normally. She'll always have to simultaneously use and fight this basic  vocabulary. 

Here, she just uses it and reveals more about her other characters than they themselves can.

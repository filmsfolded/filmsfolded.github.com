What a remarkable film! Start with Dante. He underwrote the corrupt institution that was the Church. It was hardly teetering in the short run, but its role in the Florentine tradition of literature was non-existent.

In so doing, he quite literally and singehandedly invented the Italian language. Previously, it had been thought unsuitable for intelligent, nuanced expression. Indeed, the language was as diversely varied as were the autonomous regions of Italy. His triumph was in showing that the language could indeed be used at the highest and most beautiful level.

(Centuries later, Shakespeare would be of a group doing this for the similarly vulgar English language.) In a very direct and auditable way, Dante can be said to have invented what became a nation and set a direction for selfappreciation often bordering on intellectual foppishness.

The two together (Rome and the Church) are archetypes of institution. Dante is rightly revered in Italy and the mere mention of him or his works is enough to begin motion without actually turning on the machinery of the poetry.

That's why this film was made, an odd thing if there ever was one. Here is poetry, whose value isn't in anything mentioned, but in HOW it is mentioned. And here on the other hand is a silent movie with images that roughly illustrate the "story" told in the poem and boldly ignoring the matter of language. The idea I am sure is that the mere illusion to Dante would evoke notions of ecstatic artistic quality woven into national pride.

It would help that the effects were the most elaborate of the era. But there is no poetry in this film, no cinematic virtuosity of any kind. It is as if there were institutional beads on a chain. By showing us one, the entire necklace is supposed to be imagined, imaged. More, the neck it adorns, her beauty and the charm of the party she sits in and commands.

You don't have to watch it; the thing is unremarkable as a direct experience except to students of the history of effects and national self-definition. But it is remarkable in its reach.

Being non-Italian, this viewer is amazed by the assumptions, that by invoking the merest whiff of Dante, the whole weight of it all was supposed to be experienced: the art, the institutional gravity. You should probably watch it because it illustrates things happening today that are similarly worked.

A movie today might show a stiff Nazi, a coy soft woman, a flag, a cigar, a silhouetted cowboy. And we are supposed to pull the whole institution (often commercial) they denote into our minds and taste them again. Other than music (which cinema subsumes) is there another art where this is so pronounced?

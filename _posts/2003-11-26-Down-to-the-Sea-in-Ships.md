Spoilers herein.

This is as good as it gets in one direction, that's the direction where film is honest and in  that honesty takes you to a place you could never visit otherwise.

 In this case, it attempts to capture some of the rigid early Quaker mentality, the whaling  culture and actual operations. It does only moderately well in the first two. But it does  the third uniquely well, in part because it attempts all three. In this, it follows the both  the subject and method of Melville.

 Hard to imagine today, but the whaling industry was immense and immensely influential,  It was to American society what the semiconductor industry is today. Whale oil (that  special oil from the head), for instance made precision machining possible, which made  the pocketwatch available to all, which made it possible to schedule meetings, which  made it possible for many firms to collaborate and small business to have effect. It was  the PeeCee of the times, and the reason that America is based on small business.

 But the heyday of whaling was fifty years before this film, and we luckily experience  much of what we can only now read about. All this is genuine, it seems, except for the  'Nantucket sleighride' and Clara's shipboard scenes being in a set.

 Incidentally, by the time this was made, whale oil was no longer in demand, having been  replaced by the discovery that you can get oil out of the ground without being away for  three years on the other side of the planet risking your life. Instead, the powerful whale  industry convinced consumers to buy products made of whale baleen, the teeth of a  different whale. This was a wholly advertising-driven shift which invented the corset. You  don't see that here, but you see two other baleen products, the elegant umbrellas at the  end and Patience's wedding bonnet.

 This film was made during the end of another era, the movie business was soon to move  to California. And it was not solely because of the light. It was in large part because the  oil business moved from New England to California, and with it the case law that those  Nantucket Quakers established. The film business today still relies on that case law to do business.

 More genuineness. Clara Bow's popularity was to come from her aggressively guileless  eyes. Here's where it all begins. Very impressively.

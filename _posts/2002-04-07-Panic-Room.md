Spoilers herein.

Ambitious directors have two holy grails: mastery of the self-referential narrative and establishing a new grammar of space, usually with architecture.

Fincher is an ambitious, intelligent director who in past projects has explored the first of these. This time around, he explores the second. Hitchcock did this in 'Rear Window,' a film often compared to this one. It has NO commonality at all expect the architectural aspiration.

One can see these architectural ambitions in the team he assembled: writer David Koepp did the amazing 'Snake Eyes,' the most ambitious mainstream film that explores the architecture of narrative. Cinematographer Darius Khondji is one of the recent fellow travelers of this emerging expertise. See the poetic underwater architecture in 'In Dreams.' See what he did for master Polanski in melding image and narrative in 'Ninth Gate.' Look at how his camera creates a city in 'The City of Lost Children.' He is not master of this yet (not like Welles and Kurosawa) but he is familiar with what can be done, and willing to take risks. Khondji was fired from the film by barbarian financiers because of his expensive pains. Some of his work remains, especially in the first third.

Add in Nichole Kidman (who had to drop out). I never could have guessed that this slight intellect, wife of a Scientologist, would become a force in intelligent films. But in 'Eyes Wide Shut' she learned about projecting into the unseen narrative; in 'Moulin Rouge' to the visual grammar; in 'The Others,' she projected into the space around her (as did friend and fellow Australian Crowe in 'Gladiator'). She had to drop out, but her selection is illustrative. Jodie, bless her heart, has no idea what Fincher is about so takes the story at face value.

Forest Whitaker is another telling choice. A director himself, he recently learned how to homeopathically place himself in an off-screen narrative, working the master of that trick in 'Ghost Dog.' That film worked with architected reference, not space, but the idea is the same.

One knows from the first that what Fincher has in mind an architectural exploration, starting with the titles. Each credit assigns a name to a building. Each name except Fincher's who is notably suspended in space.

Slap, slap one is quickly introduced to the building in the part of the film where one normally meets the characters. The characters here don't matter: they are furnishings. What matters is the physical relationship of spaces: four floors, stairs, elevator, etc. Right away we are also introduced to the bank of video monitors. This house is not only seen, but sees. (Shades of both 'Fight Club' and 'Snake Eyes.')

Then we are given a remarkable tracking shot that outdoes de Palma, Altman, Andersen. This starts out with various angles on Meg in bed, then goes out the room, between the balusters and down the stairwell. It eventually takes us all through the house as the baddies break in. On and on it goes, in and out of a keyhole, through the handle of a coffeepot, through floors and walls. Each moment thrills.

Then Khondji is fired and the tiresome wheels of the story grind and the requirements of the genre force us into bankable cliche. But that first third is nice.

Spoilers herein.

A widely recognized disaster. Bad story, acting, costumes, score, lighting. Probably no worse than your standard Arnie movie in this regard. Like 'Waterworld,' I think this was held to a higher standard because of the stars involved, plus here the association with Scientology.

This film takes itself seriously and pretends to say something important. But the religious depth is as trivial as in 'Star Wars,' and that film is considered a success. The power of myth is managed here by some fairly shallow minds, and in fairness, I think it common incompetence rather than religious blindness. 

Everything was banked on the visuals, and indeed some coherent notion of bleakness is apparent. But there is no novelty -- only ordinary vision here. 'Star Wars,' the first film, didn't have a novel world either and many of the same professionals were involved, but there the characters charmed. Here, they lack charm, and are able to divert attention from the cardboard world.

I believe that both 'Waterworld' and 'Battlefield' could have been fixed, or at least brought up to the 'Star Wars' standard if early in the game a coherent vision had been brought to all elements. Such visions, it is increasingly clear to me, can never come from actors for structural reasons. I wonder if 'Ishtar' is a more interesting failure?

I think there is something interesting to say about film and religion, at least so far as archetypes and mythical image. One certainly feeds the other, and we are in the midst of creating a new media religion. Down the street from me are Pat Robertson's fundamentalist christian broadcasting network and film university. They understand the newly enabled power to create a religion and are investing billions directly, and more in contributed labor, to do so. Also, it is no accident that scientology targets Hollywood.

But this film doesn't deserve such an analysis. It is too incompetent.

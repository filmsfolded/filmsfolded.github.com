Spoilers herein.

This is very tight writing. Clever twists on common themes, with one foot in humor, another in horror and a third(!) in teen pathos. That third is what is novel, sort of a "Suicide Virgins" meets "Beetlejuice."

Doesn't have much to do filmmaking like 'Blair Witch' or 'Carrie,' just simple storytelling in the Rod Serling tradition. But clever enough to be worth watching.

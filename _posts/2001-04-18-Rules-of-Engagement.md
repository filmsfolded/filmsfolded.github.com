Spoilers herein.

Thanks to the many other comments, you already know this is jingoistic tripe that misses the dramatic mark.

The two leads -- this is Jones' best role, not because he is a good actor, but because the role squarely hits the one thing he can do. Jackson is more interesting. He is a serious actor, one of several good black men in film. What's interesting is to see him play a role that doesn't exploit black stereotypes. That's rare enough, but here he exploits an equally deep American stereotype instead. It is equally entrenched in society, equally corrosive and equally accepted. I think of it as a perspective on racism by self-referentially focusing on stereotypes at a deeper level.

Not what they intended.

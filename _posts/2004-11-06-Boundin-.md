Spoilers herein.

Pixar can do little wrong in my book, at least as long as they stick to cutting edge approaches. But they know that to stay on top, they have to go a bit over the line with some audiences.

That's the case with 'The Incredibles,' which has a moral for parents who pretend that such a thing is valuable to parenting. But the moral is placed in a way that it comes close to being made fun of like nearly everything else in the project.

In other words, 'Incredibles' is great because it subtly sticks its finger in the eye of old fashioned parenting. But at the same time, it depends on getting those old fashioned parents to enthusiastically bring their kids to the screen time and time again. How to protect the investment?

Why simply tack on a short that has a moral and doesn't pull the rug out from under it. Make it cheerful and clear. Don't spend much money on the animation, in fact, the more like an old Disney project the better. After all, this is an election year where at least half the US has been artificially sensitized to 'moral values.'

This by itself is dreadful, simplistic, dangerous moralizing, of the Hallmark feelgood variety, very much in the mainstream of protestant teaching of all persuasions: accept injustice and be happy because God probably intended it that way.

But seen as a preemptive strike, it masterful provides cover for the more subversive rattling of 'Incredibles.' A little arsenic makes the sugar go down.

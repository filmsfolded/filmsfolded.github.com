Spoilers herein.

This is a film about child, one who is both IN the film and watches it.

Hard as it is to imagine today, the world of film once had ideas on the surface, and lively controversies. Men took risks and sometimes survived to be celebrated.

Here is a case: an experiment in urban photography, naturalistic acting (rather, naturalism) and investment in a narrative based on unromantic caprice. It is on many 'best of' lists. But as with many projects ('On Golden Pond' comes to mind) the IDEA of the film is far superior to the film itself. This film is mawkishly sentimental while advertising that it isn't. It is crisply crafted while claiming otherwise. It is highly stylized - especially the confrontations - where it claims verity.

The ideas explored have long ago been replaced by others more vital. As a result, the more you see this the more tired it seems. Except. Except for a couple shots of the kid, like when he is interrupted when peeing.

Spoilers herein.

This was a little amusing when I saw it new, and us rather unfunny now. It is based on a single humorous idea: self-reference. Actually, I appreciate how clever that one idea is and how well engineered its exploitation for laughs. But it is skit-level cleverness only.

The devices:

--Talking to the camera

--The show is about a show with the two blurring

--Some cameos annotate that blurring (most notably the already comic Alice Cooper).

That's it folks. The sequel does a whole lot better job at mining the self-reference.

Lara Flynn Boyle is a redhead here. She's the only player who actually acts comically and is so considered weird. Everyone else gets their comedic stance by pretending to not be comic.

Spoilers herein.

The great Phil Hoffman plays the chief technician-scientist of a group of stormchasers. As with most scientific projects, the front men/women are the figureheads. Here they are impetuous, non-methodical and pettily competitive as well. The true genius is often in the background; often brilliance is marked with personality 'disorders.' So here we have the obviously dimwitted Bill and Jo as the leaders and Dusty and his handpicked team doing the real work. The rest are content to stay in the background.

Hoffman plays the gay Dusty, who has long had a crush on Bill, the male 'scientist' leader. Through some device (of which we remain ignorant) Bill's wife drove him away from the project. This film is about the machinations of getting Bill back into the team. That the plot revolves around sexual confusion is underscored by Bill's fianc√©, who is a sex therapist (consistently experiencing 'bad communication,' through her cell phone -- rare in those days).

(There's a pretty blunt association of the storm with sexual confusion, as a story is told about a drunk, nude Bill confronting the storm.)

Dusty plays Prospero, summoning up great storms to coax events along. ("Spero" means "dust" in the gaelic Shakespeare parodies in his play.) This Prospero is not always in full control however, and the forces do get out of control at the end, harming the beloved Aunt Meg, (Meg is a sort of likable Caliban, providing nourishment and making mechanical weathercharms.) But by the end Dusty has his double victory: Bill is back and the scientific mission (at least the data collection) is done.

I know lots of Dustys, and often suspect them of creating to suit themselves that part of nature they study. The self-referential, rather clever element of the story is how Dusty conspires to focus the movie away from him. But while standing in the background, he acts up, reminding at least himself that he's in charge. Shouting "don't look at me."

Spoilers herein.

Since John Hughes there's been a rather special genre of the 'performances about performances' film, the high school movie. That's because high school kids don't yet know where or what their skin is, so they adopt one of the available containers, roles. In other words, high school kids are performers, each acting out who they think they are, or should be, stepping into predefined containers.

Its a popular genre that fits nicely with a great many other types of folded films. But its gotten rather tired. What to do? You make a folded film which is a performance about NOT performing. 'Ghost World,' 'Igby Goes Down' are examples.

Wes Anderson's world is something else all together, dealing with misappropriated influences.

The deal here is that characters are non-characters. There has to be plenty of self-referential performing: always a video camera, always a stage, plus here the glamor shots and drawings. There's the additional clever element in this project of an uncle stuck in 1982, selling 'container sets.'

(Why 1982? That was when John Hughes made his first folded selfreferential high school movie.)

There's clever construction here. And thank god they had the confidence to coach the players to be extremely blank. That blankness is what most of us will see, of course. But it is just part of the comment on how kids wear their own movie. That's why the end shifts gears so radically: a conventional movie ending occurs. All the losers find love, the klutz 'becomes' a superhero of sorts.

Spoilers herein.

There are several branches on the film family tree, the least interesting of which contains the films that are uncinematic: that are simply filmed plays. Many of these have collected the shorthand of 'character studies' but that's not quite accurate. They are plays that define characters which then define or find their situations. Though uninteresting as films, they can still find an audience if the characters have traction of some sort. (Yes, Wyler had long shots and deep focus, but those are in the service of preserving the stage, not enhancing our eye.)

The only thing this film has to offer is that the dynamics of the relationship between the two main characters (and only them) is not cartoonish. We have on the one hand a seemingly perfect man: a Midwestern tinkerer whose attention to quality and honesty built a relatively rich manufacturing firm. He retires to spend time with his wife. She on the other hand is a vile creature; a small person with money, someone whose only asset was some charm which she equates with youth, a newly rich bumpkin who aspires to aristocracy. In short, someone not worth air.

We gamely watch as she jerks her husband to Europe, cheats on him, is forgiven and cheats again, only to be rejected by the mother of the slick baron, himself an opportunist. Other than some grace on Huston's part (partly invested in Mary Astor's straightforwardness), this is completely without interest. And that same grace is found better elsewhere (see; 'Red Beard' for a more nuanced and cinematic treatment). Those who celebrate this film do so not for what it is, but what it represents. In that way, the film itself becomes like the wife: something that points to something else, something okay for a short while but in the long run to be avoided.

I did find Edith's house interesting. It is remarkably similar to Grandmother Janou's house in 'Affair to Remember' of twenty years later. By that time, Hollywood was making 'character studies' that celebrated the promiscuous, opportunistic players in this game. Grandmother Janou, you will remember, played the exact complement of Edith Cortwright. Where Edith provides a moral 'white space' Granny Janou (even from the grave!) prompts the romance of the male and female sexual opportunists.

Same house, or a copy I think.

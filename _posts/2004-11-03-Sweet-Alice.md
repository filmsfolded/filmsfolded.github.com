Spoilers herein.

I was really impressed by how this was put together. It is half Godard and half 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' except for the porn scenes. It is a movie about movies, with the inner movie being 'Candide,' itself about the same thing within. According to theorists of storytelling, this is inherently erotic.

There's a scene in the movie of the hapless cowboy in a movie (after having hired a detective) and he sees his wife in the picture taking pictures as a detective.

Spoilers herein.

Elfman oompahs and we are off! Lots of jumping and screeching later we are released, and nothing whatever sticks.

Here's the thing: Burton is an art director, not a 'real' director. He can create a 'feel' when he's cooking. Forget the story, the actors altogether. That feel can stick. The less he has to work with, the better he seems to do. Here, he has a lot and delivers... almost nothing. No real notion of an alternative world, certainly not 'dark' as his publicity machine would have it. And that's despite the costumes.

Two interesting actors though. Ms Carter has a lovely face, which really can work against her. In 'Merlin,' she had a few scenes with 'ugly' prosthetics, and her character came alive for those few moments. Here, she gets to act without the burden of her physical instrument. She's pretty intelligent, and it is interesting to see what she's worked out with her sort of face puppet.

Quit different is Tim Roth. he has always been a full body actor in the tradition of grand theater. He's ask to snarl a lot. Subtract that out, and you see his own solution. Guildenstern writ large.

Bad news when the film is so lacking, one spends ones time figuring out just what the actor is thinking under all that rubber.

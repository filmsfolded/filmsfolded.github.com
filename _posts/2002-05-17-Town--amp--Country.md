Spoilers herein.

I often seem to be liking and disliking films contrary to the general public. This one gets a pretty bad rap from the critics, partly because of its troubled delay. Just as the publicity machine talks us into believing films are good (like the muddled 'Spider-man'), they need and love stories when they can convince us the opposite.

Yes, all these actors are second-raters. Yes, the script starts at TeeVee level and wanders, giving us episodically-linked skits. Yes, everyone is old, even the here-luscious Kinski. Yes, the template is centuries-old and predictable. Yes, the dialog lacks zing and compared to Farrellys (for instance) it lacks edge. But except for the age, the same can be said of the execrable but much-celebrated 'Tenenbaums.'

The difference is that although the studio has sliced and diced this, there are still some funny bits. Very funny bits, like the polar bear/ Monroe oral sex scene. Very appealing segments like the exuberant Kinski announcing her pregnancy. Some lowkey setups like Master Beatty walking through his house and hearing each of his children, then the help furiously screwing, then all the men come out to the kitchen. Beatty's timing is great: he has the ability to coordinate his movements with his comic reactions. Its natural and effective.

Obviously, the project has suffered from different cores being swapped in and out. The now watered down scenes in front of the lawyer are an example. They were designed to be like the author/advisor role in 'You Can Count on Me.' But there is one core, now muted, that I really liked, the metaphor of building and relationship. It was horribly crude and bungled with 'Life as a House,' 'Til There was You,' and others. But there are some signs here of a potentially successful project.

Porter is an architect. Though most of this is cut, he is designing the 'Design Center' that will honor his wife. This is just as the country house which he designed and built and she 'decorated.' The awry weathervane of that house is an obvious if heavy symbol. When Mona decides to build her own new life, she aptly chooses a decayed plantation house, while Griffin chooses a cabin. Griffin by the way is a supplier of 'furnishings.' There's lots of going to and from these houses and the design center, which must have originally carried meaning.

A central quote early on: 'like old buildings and new relationships.' The cheating husband is thrown out the window.

The metaphor carries to the 'house' of ourselves -- lots of costumes: the polar bear, the transvestite, the stained jacket. Even the sex between dolls and the cello tattoo. Listing these things doesn't at all mean they were used well. They aren't, but clearly someone had some interesting ambitions.

Vampire (and werewolf) films have always been built on a foundation of sex, some approach to sex. Often the reference is blunt and the sexual issues unsophisticated, as in the "Twilight" franchise. Here we have something rather extraordinary, a well made film with a novel and engaging sexual foundation.

Our vampire in this case is an eternally prepubescent soul, locked not in a spiritual eternity as usual, but through yearning for sex. Rather a sexual role. Our vampire was infected in a way that involved castration and sexlessness. He identifies as a girl. His goal in the film is to transfer his remaining boyness to a prepubescent boy she finds.

When we first meet her, she is accompanied by a loyal but slow-witted pedophile. She is definitely in charge and there are signs of prior failed attempts of different sorts to find her/his place. She charms the boy, making him "be me for a little while." He lets that part of her into his soul, with the end of the story we see as the beginning of a romance chosen at the deepest levels.

It is sweet and stark, calculated and desperate, strengths mixed with weaknesses in Sweedish clarity and it touches a yearning we all have.

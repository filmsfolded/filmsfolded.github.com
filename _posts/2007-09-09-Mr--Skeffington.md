When you see these movies, the first reaction has to be wonder about why it was made. Its not a big budget picture, but it is evident that some care was taken with it. And its ever so long, so very long.

I think its clear that the overarching reason for this was Jewish studio heads wanting to portray a good Jew. This character is carefully engineered to be so supremely admirable that it works against itself. And that's in spite of the similarly engineered focus on Bette Davis' character, who clearly represents a silly America, self-centered and immature. Her redemption is supposed to carry the movie. There's some rather fine aging makeup, but other than that her choices are so wrong for the role we feel sorry for her rather than her character.

This is where "All About Eve," matters.

Spoilers herein.

I am precisely the right audience for what this is, but not for what it was intended to be.

It was intended to be a sweet comedy about 'things that are not as they appear.' Somehow, the director thought Gaudi's architecture/sculpture reflected that. The metaphors are potentially rich: it is a book made into a film that leads to the book; the only man is a magician; we have a few gender shifts. But the direction is so leaden, these opportunities become ordinary. Superficially, the film is a dud.

But what we do have is four enticing actresses, each of whom have elsewhere done hypnotizing work. We have one of the nicest title sequences and apt scores. And we have Gaudi. That's enough to put this on my worth watching list. Gaudi is the first cinematic architect. His work isn't fully exploited here, but perhaps that's for the best to judge from the director's commentary. She gets lots of facts wrong, and calls some of it 'Flintstoney.'

Here's the deal with Gaudi: his work is as close as you can get to frozen sex, to manifest dreams, to physical passion. Being in some of them (but not the cathedral) with the right attitude can change you forever by having the structure of your imagination envelop you.

There's a scene in the Guell Crypt. This is possibly the most alive space on the planet, but she didn't photograph it well. In the film, it is supposed to be the crypt of the large cathedral, still under construction. In reality it is quite a way out of town, Guell was to build a commune for his tile workers and this was to be the chapel. Gaudi labored for over a decade on it and still only built the basement, while consuming many times the budget for the whole community! The basement was just roofed over and turned into local chapel. So what you have is an extremely dense suggestion of what the entire structure would be: the best kind of building since you invent it yourself from what you see. rather like acting.

Everyone should visit this space before they die. But until you do, you can take what you see of this film and invent your own film and space to complete it.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4: Worth watching

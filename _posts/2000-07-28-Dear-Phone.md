This is obviously a film schoolish experiment. It consists of alternating images of two types. The first is of many of those silly red British Telecom phone booths. (They seem silly to a non-Brit.) The second are views of ragged pages of the script that is being read.

The small readings are stories involving phone calls to women named Zelda from men named HC.

This film is not of high interest as a whole work.

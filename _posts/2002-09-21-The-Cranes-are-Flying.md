Spoilers herein.

Soviet era intellectuals led the world as the center of abstract notions about real life. Their mathematicians were characterized by it, and one sees it in their literature, music and film. Eisenstein and especially Tarkovsky defined a new abstract eye: a disembodied poetic camera that contrasted with Hitchcock's equally innovative but curious camera. Here we see that abstract Soviet eye. This is not great art: the story is vapid and the acting is typically exaggerated. But the camera follows the lead of fellow geniuses. This camera is extraordinary, using crane shots in unusual ways: one following Veronica while she frantically searches for Boris as he leaves; one before following Boris racing up several flights of stairs.

Unhappily, those stairs are central to the story later when Veronica's flat is bombed. She goes up the destroyed stairs, but they are noticeably different stairs. Oh well, watch this for a different -- and to my mind rather controversial -- use of the camera as dancer.

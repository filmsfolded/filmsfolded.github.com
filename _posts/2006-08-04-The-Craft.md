This is a cheapy production, designed to introduce us to a sort of appealing sisterhood (Traveling pants-style) and then sock us with effects at the end when the consequences of selfish magic come home.

So two halves. The first half is dreadful, absolutely dreadful. I suppose these actresses have some ability to charm, though there is only one I have seen do so. Neve did a self-produced Altman project that was intelligent and I will be forever grateful to her. But here, nothing.

The second half is a matter of snakes, mostly. Bugs. Levitating schoolgirls who magically spat.

The only curious thing in this is the older woman who is a witch, supplies paraphernalia and an initial refuge. She has a magical setup on a special spot. In a normal tale, she'd come swooping in at the end to save the day. We keep waiting for it as these girls are shown to be incompetent at managing energies and desires. 

But no. We never see her again. Its just girl on girl.

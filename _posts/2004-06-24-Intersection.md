Spoilers herein.

I admit to a weakness for any film that attempts to be architectural in some fundamental  way. Even the  failures - and they are mostly failures - are usually interesting. And this one features a  redhead as well, a cinematic device that is similarly architectural in some ways. But that is  another story.

One of the small number (23?) of plots is: man makes - literally creates - his own world  and it turns on him. He usually wins except in 'adult' films where he doesn't. In this case,  the creative medium is architectural. 

I'm not usually a fan of Gere, but I have to appreciate the way he moves. He's a dancer and  the relationship he has to space is apt. The backdrop is rather ordinary: he is an architect we  are told but the architecture shown is underwhelmingly faddish. But there is a nice touch in  that the museum is for the Potlatch culture where the space of one is designed by the other  side.

A particularly apt architectural metaphor for the conflict depicted here, and the gifts  exchanged at the end.

Recently, I watched "Snow White" and was amazed again. So I had to follow it with this, which is a sort of nadir in the art of film. 

The story, is actually every bit as promising as "Snow White" was. In fact to my mind it is better.

Unjust subordination. Magic. Love at first encounter. A sexual union. Loss (magic again). Search. Reward.

Now, in the source stories, there are plenty of versions that were explicitly bawdy in the search and what was attempted to fit into what among all the eligible maidens. But even without this, there is plenty of room for fable elaboration. You could take this in many, many directions. These things are clouds of rich quantum possibilities.

What does Disney do? Insert Tom and Jerry sequences. Where "Snow White" pulled short cartoons into long form film, this pulls by then well established long form animation back into short cartoon form.

Spoilers herein.

In its day, this was a strong film. It had action of ordinary men under duress. It pitted a wild Mother Nature against our characters as well. It featured some interesting moral issues for the time.

My how times have changed, and subsequent thousands of films have blunted the effect this once had. The summer action genre pulled the legs out on that side, and that's probably the main thing. But more interesting is the moral dimension. Here, Voight's character feels compelled to cover up the whole thing, and there is some question whether an innocent man was killed. But we as viewers have greater certainty that this is not so, it is just an additional matter to haunt the man. 

What has evolved since this is a simultaneous blunting and sharpening of moral acuteness in film, but in different types of film, leaving no room in the middle for this sort of thing. The blunting is obvious. As the economies of film raise costs, most stories have gotten simpler and less ambiguous. The bad guys are clear and despicable. In nearly all cases the 'right' thing happens in the end, driven by test audience reactions.

That's opened the market for a growing class of 'art' or intelligent film, mostly independent. And many of these explore moral issues, some in extreme ways. That dulls the emotional impact of the comparatively minor damage of a guy who pushes through all odds, survives and lies about it.

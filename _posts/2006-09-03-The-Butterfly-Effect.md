Things like this depress me. It panders; its stupid; it treats us like children.

This comes from the tradition of folding the narrative by reinventing things we have seen. Probably the most celebrated of these is "Rashomon," and the most famous "Groundhog Day." The idea is usually one of untrusted narrators through whose minds different realities flow. Sometimes the rewriting only happens after we leave the theater having seen something that reinvents what we've seen inside.

It has to be clever. It has to be bold to engage us. "The I Inside" and "Primer" are so much more intelligent than this (and harder to figure out), so they actually engage.

So I will advise you to stay away from this because of how dumb the writers believed you to be. But there's probably a more fundamental reason. You can be outside a story, or inside. Or you can be both, but it always starts with the outside because that's where you naturally start, even with your own life. 

The artists involved have to help you in. That's job number one. They can't do it by assuming you in, as is done here. Its lazy and it doesn't work.

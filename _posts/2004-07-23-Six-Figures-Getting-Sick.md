Spoilers herein.

There's no question that Lynch is one of the most interesting film artists today. This is  because he knows how to fold the seemingly perverse with dreamlike shifts and rhythms  while at the same time weaving a reflexive annotation on the fact that he is being reflexive.

You can see all of that even in this early project. There's no special insight here, just  confirmation.

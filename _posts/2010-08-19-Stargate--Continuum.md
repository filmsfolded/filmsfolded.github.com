I remember seeing the original movie and being impressed. In its day it was a risky mix of genres plus the expected overwhelmed by the unexpected. Later I studied the industry and took this film apart in terms of how the concepts were managed. 

It worked and I know why. Later, the safe parts were made into a lame TeeVee show following the then already lame Star Trek formula. 

I did not know what to expect coming to this. The first two minutes are an extraordinary tracking shot that sets context, introduces the heroes and establishes the energy of thing. After that, I might as well have been watching William Shatner. In fact, I believe that they hired someone else to direct those first two minutes while a committee of writers was re- engineering the script.

There was an opportunity here to do something clever with time travel paradoxes. What we got was Back to the Future" with spaceships and Arctic ice.

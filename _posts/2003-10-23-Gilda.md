Spoilers herein.

Modern Tarantinos strive to pile up all sorts of historical film-world mechanisms on their  films. But  nothing beats going back to some of the dumptruck films of the past and reveling in the  real thing.

Here, we have a story that - except for the oddly imposed ending - is a dark as they  come: and not pleasantly so. Everything is played straight, no irony colors this amazing  depressing visit to the dark side. And it is not just the dark jealousy, it reaches all the  way into the guilt many Americans felt after the war. A few were heros, but many were  opportunists or slackers and that survivor guilt was pretty strong for a while. That opening shot of us rising from  the depths in response to a dice roll is classic.

Quite independent of that, we have corners of this film that are reserved for star-making  episodes for Ms Hayworth. This is my best example of beauty created by lighting and  motion. Look closely and you will see a plain face and a dumpy torso. With this raw  material, she and her mentor were able to create film glamour made rich by the fantasies  of remote servicemen.

This woman has a remarkable control over her body and sets some new film motions to  dramatically indicate poise, now widely used as if they were there all along. All this is  focused on her forehead. Most actors act with only  one part of their body and in this case it is that extended forehead. During this period,  she was  married to Orson Welles, probably the one man in the world who knew the most about  this sort of thing. He coached her on this, and it shows. Watch what he had her do next  in 'Lady from Shanghai.'

And finally we get the guild part: the machinery that turned out B-movies. This wasn't  really a B-movie, but it had all the same sensibilities. In this case, much of what we see is  a result of that engine just doing its thing. There are a couple very subtle lighting effects  in unlikely places, for example the slats on her dress as she visits Ford at the casino after  they were married.

The whole thing gives the impression of a studio system and all its gears and pulleys a  little out of control. That metaphor of casino and monopoly is pretty apt.

It may be that this works and I just cannot get at it because I'm not Australian, but I doubt it.

Its rambling, often incoherent nature may be designed as part of the effect, but I doubt that too.

Its really quite ambitious, a sort of Tarantino/Richie mix with a bit of coming of age and whole lot of Aussie peculiarity in it. There's a noir intervention by a dead guy.

I watched it because it had Heath Ledger as the center, and I was a little curious what with his newly established sainthood. The River Phoenix effect. 

What we have is a teen goofoff who is asked by the local petty mafia to do something. It goes wrong and a chase ensues. There's a romance, natch. There's a moment where honor is established and justice comes home by an unexpected means. The charm in the thing comes not from the story or the hero, but from the abstract design of the thing. We know what to expect from the very beginning because the font that is used in the titles is that chrome Chevvie script from the late fifties. It might have been used in Australia by Holden. The movie is set in then contemporary time, but it references the fifties in the manner of the film itself and the hoods therein. 

Don't come to this if what you want is great work from Ledger.

I'm annoyed with Oliver Stone. He has such an energetic eye, such an instinct for rhythm that he almost can't fail to make a movie you think you are engaged in. Some of the handling here of the energy is his best, really his best. And that's even discounting the two vapid images he keeps coming back to.

One is the recurrence of bubbles. This is remarkably blunt as those rats that Scorsese put at the end of his "Departed." The other is the really annoying and repeated way he combines buildings and quantitative displays. These two notions just smack you in the face with the man's stupidity in the world. He is famously dull and obnoxious and you can see it in the way he handles this simple sort of metaphoric visualization. I surely have no desire to meet him. And if I did I might think as badly of him as Jake thinks of Bretton, for how selfishly and blindly he treats the notion of space, as if buildings were there for his billboard cosmos.

And the story itself is so patently formulaic you want to scream. Will the young couple have their happy life and baby? Will the rouge father come to his senses? Will the bad guy get his just deserves? Will, will we even know that the genius scientist is funded so that we can get free, unlimited power from seawater?

But shucks, even all these sins we forgive, because the man can make lovely eye music. If Woody Allen is Chopin, the Stone is Wagner.

I hate to give this a three, but the things that are good -- and I mean Talking Heads level good -- are good enough.

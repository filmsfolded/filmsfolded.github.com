Snuffing Marines on Okinawa

I am absolutely amazed at how vital the vampire meme is. It ranges from deeply sexual expression to a generic stand-in for the "other" against which you do battle. In this project, it is so generic it is pushed aside so that sharper archetypes can be brought to the fore.

Here we have a Japanese Buffy, though I assume her character predates that TeeVee show. She is a 400 year old samurai master in a 15 year old body. The plot has her in a Japanese sailor school uniform. She battles evil ninja zombies, sometimes as lumbering zombies, sometimes as flying beasts, and sometimes as ordinary sword-wielding masked ninjas. The disparately is not explained, nor does it seem to need to be.

This was made before Japan announced a major re-arming of its military, so there is an odd setting of the story. They wanted military gear and your typical stupid general. So they set this on an American military base in Japan. This allows some background guys, gaijin with dark suits that act like Matrix types. This alien overlap: Americans in Japan and Vampires in the world, should not be lost on us. A nitwit American (girl) is assigned as sidekick.

Nor is the girl-woman business. Turns out that the master vampire is revealed to be her mother, who she angrily kills. 

I do not know the amine on which this is based. Usually the nubile sexuality of the young girls are the whole point. That sailor uniform is such a strong indicator that the profound modesty of the girl here is shocking. The body shape is completely hidden in a skirt below the knees with a blouse buttoned to chin. There is no body display at all which makes me wonder who the target audience was. Nobody but preteen boys would be interested in this junk.

She does have that smoldering look, head down, eyes raised with menacing knowledge of absolute control. Maybe the filmmakers figured that was enough.

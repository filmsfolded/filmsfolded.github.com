Spoilers herein.

dePalma, Wolfe, Fallows: three men approach their art. In each case, their sponsoring environment presses in to perturb and pollute. In each case, they center the narrative on cartoonish drama, but the real art has nothing to do with the tokens. Rather, the art is in designing the distance between the reporter and the action.

That is the whole of Wolfe's art, his placement of self to the world. His books are famously ghostwritten so far as the story -- to keep the tone and much of his language but have the story make sense. But the story doesn't matter, it is only an excuse for an abstract irony, a reverse voyeurism that readers like.

This book is self-referential in that the author faces the same dilemma. The film was designed to also self-referentially encapsulate these two layers, forming a third. dePalma famously studies these problems and how they can be solved by the stance of the collective eye through his camera.

So yes, the story in this film was destroyed by incessant meddling by the studio. Yes, the performances are way off as a result of rampant egos. Yes, the resulting story and characters are wholly unengaging. That's a plus, folks. Surely dePalma did not intend such a pool of muck, but it works for him just as is does for Wolfe and Fallows.

dePalma's eye is cast here in the Nabokov mode: another half step away from the action, commenting on itself but not quite sure where reality and fiction divide. The eye is ambiguous. We supposed to be subliminally aware of it: note how few angles are ones a human would have, how few motions are ones an observer would make.

The tone is indicated in the first shot where timelapse shows jets coming into Newark, turning into comets turning into the title. This is followed by a nearly five minute continuous traveling shot introducing Fallows as narrator, bringing him to us, the swarming crowd. It is only matched by that first scene in 'The Player' (of the next year) which attempts the very same commented distance.

Fallows as Hubert. A brilliant idea, latter annotated by making the annoying Melanie Dorothy's mother. This completed a trilogy where dePalma used here previously as the deceptive, meaningless focus in "Body Double" where the real meaning was elsewhere.

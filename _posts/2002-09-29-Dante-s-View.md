U-Turn Meets Bound with a Cabiria Ending

Spoilers herein.

There must be an official subgenre or doomed runaway crook movies. This has nothing new, nothing that takes you to new and unfamiliar places. In fact we've been here dozens of times.

Is this the actress who did 'Go Fish?' and did she work at hiding the lesbian subtext here? She's really very appealing.

What's interesting to me is that pretty much everything was done competently except the editing which was better than usual for this type of fare, and the music. The music was so dreadful it killed the whole project. I predict in a few years this will become a cult film for kids with Macs who'll add a good, really good sound track and re-edit it to suit, perhaps shuffling some time. Could turn out to be a pretty good film. Who'll be the first to try?

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find better things to do with this part of your life.

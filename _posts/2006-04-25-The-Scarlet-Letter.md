(This comment covers the 98 minute restored version.)

I wonder how things can sometimes work as if they made sense. Its the 'intelligent design" illusion, I suppose. Here's a film made 90 some years ago, within the first decade of the real movie business. It was based on an 1850 novel. It is closer in time to that novel than us, which is something of a jolt.

And yet, it comes across with such modern ideas about self-reference. If "Dogville" wasn't inspired by this, it could have been.

You know the story, no doubt: an intolerant mob, led by public figures who obsess about conformity to notions which from a distance are obviously designed to maintain their power. Any deviance is a threat to the community. No more modern theme exists.

But it is the manner of the drama that is of interest, in the story and the way it is presented.

In the story, a person isn't simply recognized as deviants, they are labeled. They literally wear signs, in the manner of Red Guard placards detailing their sins. (Or Jesus...) We are introduced to this notion early in the movie. The letter in question is such a sign.

But there are others as well. The minister who is haunted acts in the most dramatic way, clutching his heart constantly. This is not only for us, the viewers, but for his love. At one point the daughter asks why the minister is always clutching his heart and then makes fun of it.

However, the way the thing is presented to us is the same: a collection of labeled episodes. Each one begins with an appearance and then labels itself. Often the labeling for us and for the townspeople overlap. In some of these cases, there is a stage, notably at the end, where our on screen audience bows their head as we are intended to do.

There's no tenderness here, only expositions of tenderness. Expositions. Placards.

Sometimes watching these old films is a visit to the past. In this case, the film visits us.

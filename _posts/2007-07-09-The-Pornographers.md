Here's a modern idea. The movie starts with someone sitting down to watch a porn film. 

Then those same folks end up in the film. The bridge between the two, the film and the film within, is the eye of a carp, what we would call a large goldfish.

It is here, I think, that Kusturica got his observing goldfish that drives this film with Depp: "Arizona Dream."

That film within is about a filmmaker and his various troubles, including with his adopted family. This inner film has yet another inner film, twinned, about a man having sex with his daughter.

Then it ends with the film within ending and the watchers remarking on it.

Its of interest because it is the earliest Japanese film I know that has this overtly folded construction. But I will recommend a far more engaging, slightly later film: "Hatsukoi: Jigoku- hen." It has a more subtle construction and far more engaging emotional content. It matters, this doesn't.

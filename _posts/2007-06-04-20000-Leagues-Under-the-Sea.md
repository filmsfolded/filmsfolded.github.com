This doesn't have the power it once had. "Forbidden Planet" still does in comparison. The reason for me is several-fold. One is that they decided to invest too much in Lorre and Douglas, and it just doesn't work. Maybe it never did and we overlooked that for the other pleasures.

They were two. One was the intriguing story of a genius inventor turned antiwar ecoterrorist. It was such an odd, noble and attractive idea in its time, but now it is even isn't notable.

The big swell of interest for this was something that I think is shared by no other sci-fi film, except perhaps those early Soviet-block space movies. When this film came out, featuring and "atomic" submarine, the US Navy launched the first of it nuclear subs, also named "Nautilus." This was still in the era that advanced technology was associated with large powerful objects, instead of tiny things that did invisible tasks.

The toy tie-in was in plastic models. You could buy a model kit of each submarine and assemble them. The Navy sub had removable panels so you could actually see the reactors, imagining the blinding light shown in the movie. Those days were brief, where the science tie-in wasn't in the characters and their dolls but in something related to the invisible forces of nature, somewhat magical. 

You could play with this model, emulating the three foes of the movie: stupid authority, equally stupid primitives (obviously the non-technically interested) and natural creatures standing in for nature. (This latter with the knowledge that in the film the submarine was seen as a monstrous animal.)

It was the children of this time, the audience of this movie, that put Jimmy Carter in the White House, in some part based on his association with the Nemo character. And though the "credit" can easily be shared, he was the one who started the clock on the end of the Soviet Empire.

All that is gone now, the noble spirit and the notion of technology in objects that can enclose and support humans. It lived on for ever so long in "Star Trek," which borrows heavily from this. But even that simple stroke is gone too.

Spoilers herein.

'Dirty Dancing' meets 'Best in Show' and is better than either. That's because this has a coherent soul. That soul is the edgy production design by Baz's partner (and now wife) Catherine Martin.

She found the sweet spot which loves all the frippery but keeps distance from the foolishness at the same time. I imagine all the cartoon sound effects (since found in Romeo and Moulin) were her idea as well. This film is to production design as Scott's steps are to ballroom dancing: enough within the parameters to not be outside what we accept as film reality. But at the same time, outside the convention enough to please us with the flash.

The train scene was effective. Very impressive. The Coke sign as well. But the piece that I will remember is the story-within-the-story about the 1967 Championship. The style of that was carefully placed as far from the rest of the movie as the movie is from 'real' life. Very clever. Very insightful. It registers our imagination.

The photography of the dance did not dance itself, which is a real shame. Baz and crew learned a real lesson on this, and the 'Moulin' camera does dance.

Branagh continues to fascinate. Here is his most ambitious experiment in terms of adaptation, here of the play with the strange apostrophes. The play is an early one, a confection with some wonderful language, but little poetry. The play as written constantly reminds the audience that these are players. They take on roles within the play, and provide copious contemporary references to stupid ideas. Contemporary figures are parodized (Harriot, Florio, Raleigh...). A true adaptation would likely make fun of Pat Robertson and creationism. Branagh's notion is not very true to the spirit of the play, so his choices should be held to a very high standard indeed.

The good: Branagh plays the role that was almost certainly Shakespeare's. And does wonders with the few lines left. Also, the film is just about the funniest I have ever seen. Shakespeare was having fun with rival Marlowe, so was making fun of the fantastic plotting of contemporary plays. Branagh's humor is in how he shows us how absolutely ridiculous are the much-beloved musicals of the 30s-40s. In so doing, he uses obvious non-singer, nonactors to accentuate the effect.

This is along the lines of what Shakespeare did with Armado, Holophernes, Costard, Dull, Moth and the Wench. These are supposed to be not only ridiculous characters but ridiculous actors. Branagh did this with Michael Keaton in the earlier Much Ado where we recognize the comically ineffective comic effort. Spall is the best here, but the Wench Jacquanetta is perfect in her small part.

Also good: Branagh knows how to start a movie! Here we have a different effect than the superb Much Ado, but very well crafted. His approach of the princess and her maids on the boats is delicious. Alicia Silverstone is here because of her skill at fey coyness, which she delivers. But she shows real courage in putting her chubby thighs in fishnet stockings and dancing next to her svelte companions. My hat is off to her.

The bad: So far as Shakespeare's language is concerned, everyone but Branagh is poor. I understand deliberately letting an amateurishness show in the song and dance, but not, heavens not in some of the world's most lovely language. Beyond appreciation for Branagh's fearlessness, one misses the scenes that were cut and their language. I did not appreciate the change in gender of the pedant. Suppose that's part of modernity, but the new character wasn't silly, rather somewhat lovable. Why? This film has historic significance not only for The Tempest, but as a window into "great house studies" which influenced the foundations of modern science and logic. A loss without these insights.

Yes, a loss. But how can you be angry at an effort that is so funny.

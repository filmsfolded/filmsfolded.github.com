Spoilers herein.

We want our heroes. That's my explanation for the popularity of this film, which  appeared after the key assassinations in the US. Vietnam was ramping up and we  believed we would never again see politicians with real honor and character.

This is not a proper film, instead a play and is treated so in all respects. As a play, it is  rather simple, and aptly so as it is set well before Elizabethan drama added complexities  to simple morality plays. The story is simple: everyone on the planet is flawed in some  extreme way except for loyal good citizen, noble lawyer, loving father, staunchly honest  Tom.

The story is Tom's strategy to avoid being punished for opposing the king by never  precisely _saying_ that he opposes him. Or rather his divorce. All the talk -- and that's  all there is -- is about not talking.

You might find some amusement in watching this in anti-Stoppard mode: the greatest  word game is where no words are spoken, only anticipated.  I am reminded of a Basil  Rathbone Holmes movie; 'Woman in Green' where Moriarty says something like 'All that I  have to say has already crossed your mind,' and Holmes replies: 'and my answer has  crossed yours. ' But that's a grim game in the face of the heavy moralizing here.

The point is supposed to be that any man should find his own truth and then follow it.  But the moralistic stance of this story is absolute: there is only one truth in this film, and  we are all asked to figuratively sign an oath.

Well, not me.

Incidentally, the history of this period is fascinatingly rich and complex. Read about in  some place that doesn't bleach it down to a comic book.

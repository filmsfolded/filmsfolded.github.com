This is yet another film that manipulates simply. You rise, you cry as you were expected to and you expected yourself to. The technique is simple: take ordinary, familiar experiences -- it doesn't matter if they are true, better if not -- and shape them into a familiar arc. We go along for the ride in part because it is easy. We get a cheap reward, but the cost is cheap as well.

That describes both this movie and the concerto that is its focus. The story is embarrassingly simple. By itself it makes no sense whatever. It revolves around an interrupted performance of the Tchaikovsky piece out of which came both an obsession to complete the performance and a child who would be able to do so. Her origins are a mystery which are revealed during the victorious performance.

Along the way are events associated with the interrupted concert and the recollection of the dispersed orchestra. This, and the journey to Paris from Moscow provide the basis for the sustaining entertainment value until we get to the concert. Massive warehouses of stereotypes are emptied in this process: Jews are moneygrubbing; Russians are uncontrolled drunkards; Soviet commissars are bloviated nitwits; musicians are angels on Earth; "Gypsies" are resourceful sneaks; the French are effete poseurs . All of this is supposed to be funny.

We are finally presented with the concert itself. The preparation has us being told the requisite three times that music, and this piece in particular, makes the world better by being a way to find harmony. We hear the piece, inharmonious at first, then snapping into glorious perfection, led by the maestro, suppressed for thirty years, an orchestra that has not played together for that time, and a violinist who has never played the piece. We swoon, prompted by our on-screen surrogates in the audience.

Problems though.

The identity of the violinist is presented as a great mystery, kept from her and others. But it makes no sense except being an excuse for something to reveal. The notion that a piece of music progresses from chaos to order when properly understood is so wrong it promotes tears. Good music finishes with power in part because it starts magically, weaving us into it. Here, the musicians denote the bad start by playing untuned instruments; how they magically get in tune is overlooked: perhaps they think if we accept all else this offense would not matter.

Sure, because that is the form of the movie as well. By then, we have a collection of random episodes that are meant to entertain us while we wait for the movie to hit its harmonious stride. And then we get to the problem of Tchaikovsky.

Russian romantic music is sweetened vulgarity. It, like this movie, relies on the familiar manipulated in known ways. It amuses but does not edify. It makes us cry -- everyone on screen does and you will too. But it is a contrived, thin occupation of our sensitive bits. I sat and drank it in. But this is a very bad movie in terms of value. It will not feed your soul, and it will assault your private project to assume the best in others.

MÃ©lanie Laurent unimpressively plays the magical violinist. What is impressive is that she really seems to be playing.

Spoilers herein.

This film is fun. Clark Gable has some great bits, including some with 'Shapeley.' But along the way, it demonstrates a couple theories I have about successful films.

The first is that the actors are often the last ones to know what a film is all about. They have a different set of concerns than the filmmaker. Sometimes this is taken advantage of by the filmmaker, who exploits the unwittingness of the actor. The Coens do this all the time: they'll have one actor who is clued in and at least one actor who is not and there is a several-layered goof on the target.

Here, Ms. Colbert walked through this picture more or less as the character she played: completely at the mercy of forces around here but believing she was in control; absolutely oblivious to the actual manipulations at work. She thought the picture was bad, a well known story that. But I think that except for the few cases where the actor is the only attraction (think of the bombastic performances of the latter DeNiro or Pacino for instance) the actor and filmmaker are working at crosspurposes.

The second of Ted's laws is that nearly all successful stories includes itself in some referential way. This is a (movie) story about a (newspaper) story. The people engaged in the creation, the reporting of the movie are mirrored in the characters engaged in similar reporting. This is a pervasive narrative device, so much so, I've decided to write a book about it.

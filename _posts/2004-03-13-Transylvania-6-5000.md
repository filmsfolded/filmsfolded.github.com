Spoilers herein.

Sid Caesar invented a specific form of comedy skit. You have a transparently thin story  that you invite several comedic actors to populate. They come in and invent their own  characters and much of the dialog. If there are enough different types, then everyone can  find the one of two they like.

Viewers are amazingly tolerant: they will put up with a large percentage of dead screen  time in exchange for a few laughs as long as you don't go in the hole somehow. 

For my money, Carol Kane leads the pack here.

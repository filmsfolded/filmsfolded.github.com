My own theory about Woody is that he makes films for himself only. Recently I saw 'Sweet and Lowdown' and think it one of the most multidimensionally complex, introspective films I've ever seen. I also saw 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' and thought he was working with ideas too big for his skills. Rather like the character Woody plays in this film. 

In fact 'Sweet' was successful because the actor (Sean Penn) was able to convey a Woody that had some natural skill, who in his heart knew he was secondrate, and who also had publicly criticized eccentricities. Penn could convey that Woody. Woody could never, and that's the root of the problem with this film.

There're two types of New Yorkers. Those with class and those without, regardless of fame and wealth. Woody pokes fun at himself here for his own benefit. But for us viewers, there's not much here, and except for a few skits, there are few laughs.

But chances are that if you are reading this, you're going to or have seen this anyway. If so, isn't May a gas? She's one of those aristocrats of comedy, and there's a double joke here. She plays the dimmest wit, though in real life, she would be the top cookie. And she had a meteoric rise in Hollywood until writing/directing 'Ishtar' with two of the then biggest stars. It was the biggest flop in history until 'Waterworld,' and even then WW made money. 

Having her in this fable of up/down and having her steal every scene is so sweet.

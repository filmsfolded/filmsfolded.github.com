If you have been following Czech animation, you'll be excited by this. The promising flash of Wallace and Gromit has passed into bland commercialism, and the torch now passes to Klimt. His earlier 'Bell' was still overly preachy. But this is something else. This is art, the use of the method to create a world and out of that world a disturbing cosmology emerges. This is different from Svankmejer who starts with a moral and then illustrates it. Instead, we have the entry into the world that reveals its dynamics.

These dynamics are truly hypnotizing, and allow us to see and laugh at the still strong Soviet mentality. This is very rich writing, apparently simple and effortless. Worth watching as a film and as a promising trend for the art.

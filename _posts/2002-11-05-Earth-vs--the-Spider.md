Spoilers herein.

Another film animated by the therimin. What would we have ever done without that spooky sound to make up for all the cheezy effects and lack of dramatic skill? It is the equivalent to the laugh track in comedy: tells you were to react even though you may not have by yourself. Here we have Carlsbad Caverns as well.

We forget how drive-ins created a market for whole genres. One thing you need is highschoolers as the primary cast. They have to use really cool cars. Skeptical adults. A rock and roll band.

Carol (Carroll?) has a decidedly 'Alice in Wonderland' look. Makes sense. Intelligent. I thought I would gag, but the use of the caverns in places (when a wide shot) is really something impressive.

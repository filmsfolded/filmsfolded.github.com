Spoilers herein.

My mother's a strange old bird. In her dining room is a piece of furniture so repellent  that it frightens children and intimidates meals -- this is a disturbing piece friends. It  has a purpose but serves that purpose poorly, much worse than many design

alternatives. Why does she keep and value it? Because the craftsmanship is very fine and  obviously so. In fact, as a master cabinetmaker myself, I see that the craft is overly  dramatic, asserting its own craftsmanship. It is not a real piece of furniture so much as  an expert dramatization of one.

My mother is typical: instead of a useful, beautiful piece, she'll take one that affirms her  appreciation for richness any day. That's why this film exists.

It is very finely made in all departments. In fact, it is assertive in advertising how finely  made it is. Where Tarkovsky would have given a dwelling that has natural depth, this one  is almost stagily garish. Where Kurosawa would have framed situations, here we have   situations overtly subservient to frames. Where, say, Tennesse Williams (or dozens of  others) would take us on a journey through our own soul involving pain, here we have  the pain alone with no apparent purpose than to support the richness of the project.

What punishment is planned in Bergman's Lutheran Hell for a master who wastes his gift  on merely displaying it?

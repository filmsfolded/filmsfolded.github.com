This film is remarkable because of the involvement of Harold Pinter. He is the most intelligent adapter of books for film that has yet been produced, having written the wonderfully self-referential 'French Lieutenant's Woman.' 'French' is one of the ten best-written films in history -- and Streep's most multidimensional performance too!

Pinter's (yet unfilmed) screenplay for Proust is studied by every film student; he has even done Kafka. So his involvement here set high promise.

What is attempted is something worthy of a Pinter: a multidimensional folding of making a writer equivalent to one of her characters; to make a book about the writing of a book; to submit that containment in the book is like slavery or (the feminist statement) a marriage without love. Along the way, the filmmaker further intends to expand a relatively weak (for Austin) book in ways thought to preserve its intent as if Austin were writing for film.

Most of the artists involved in this film are of high caliber. The problem is that none are of the caliber needed to achieve the level required of the aspirations. An interesting attempt though. I think we should celebrate the intent even though it misses the mark. How else will we encourage intelligence and risk-taking?

I saw this with "Pandorum." That film had some very, very appealing ideas that were blotted into the ground by inept filmmaking. I felt somewhat the same with this. In the case of Pandourm, the ideas were very much in the way of besting serious science fiction at its own game. In this case, the ideas were all external, all designed to subvert and parody the genre, such parodies being a genre themselves.

In both cases, the filmmaking was inept, and ruined the projects. Unlike the "Pandorum" case, all the value in this Buckaroo experiment is cinematic.

Yes, there are all sorts of half-baked notions, but they are essentially visual. A device is to reference story lines outside the film, and that is done by cinematic devices. Some of the production design is pretty imaginative, and really cannot be appreciated unless you leave the film and browse the DVD extras. A few jokes are big misses, and most are clever but juvenile. Some, like the several Orson Welles references, the Rastafarian context and Yoyodyne are precious. 

If you can stand the background noise, the overtly noted inability to support long form and an overly made up Ellen Barkin, there are some visual pleasures here.

If you have the DVD, take the trouble to first play the deleted introduction. It is brilliant.

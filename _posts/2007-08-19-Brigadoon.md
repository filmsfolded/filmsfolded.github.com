Possibly the worst musical of the era, especially notable because it has some of the best talent of the era involved. It isn't wholly because Minnelli dyed the redheaded Cyd Charisse black; this after all was the guy that dyed his lover's hair red in "Meet Me in St Louis," among the best musicals ever. And it isn't wholly the dumb sets and hokey dialog.

I think Minnelli was faced with a specific challenge. Here was a stage play that leveraged the pretend nature of the stage to suggest that an imaginary village really could exist. The magic of the stage compounded the magic of the village. I think Minnelli believed he could do much the same in the movie by simply filming a stage play, but with more dancing.

The result looks like a rehearsal. It has no energy, no magic. This viewer could barely watch it, and possibly wouldn't have if it weren't for a rather miraculous orange color in Cyd's petticoat. That color so perfectly matches some combination of technicolor dyes, and is a message from an inner place that flashes from time to time when Cyd has to mess through Kelly's bad choreography. What was Astair doing?

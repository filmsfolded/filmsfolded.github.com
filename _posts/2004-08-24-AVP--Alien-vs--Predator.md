Spoilers herein.

I've made a study of what differentiates the Alien films. Their differences are a concise film  school. 

Now this here is a different beast. It is a simple essay, not an ordinary long form film. You  might like it because of the very idea, or the plot device of switching the ordinarily hunted  into a trusted partner of the hunter. The previous films form the foundation for this one  which must become smaller.

That 'pyramidal' notion is behind the one thing that did interest me here. Once you become  familiar with the monsters (as we all are), and you know that the human situation must stay  in the expected rut, then the only way to innovate is in the novel setting.

What we have here is an alien pyramid that is part 'Cube' part 'Thirteen Ghosts,' something  that mechanically resembles an orrery. We're even told about it being a synthesis of three  "races" of pyramids.  A good idea, down to the allusion to the shaft as one of the mysterious  'air shafts' of the Cheops pyramid. Alas, this was too slighted because by the time we get it,  we are too high in the food pyramid.

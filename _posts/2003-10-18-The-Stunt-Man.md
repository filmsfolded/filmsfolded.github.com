Spoilers herein.

There are quite a few movies like this, films that reference films and that also aver that  the drama within can bend the reality without. The kernel of this idea was 'Citizen Kane'  but it seemed to flower after John Fowles published 'The Magus' and the Beatles  followed his lead.

This one has O'Toole who had done something similar in 'Lion in Winter.' It uses the  third dimension better than anything of the time. It is steeped in paranoia and  antiVietnam sentiments. This last dates it, oddly; American culture and imagination  seems to have flopped the other way. The closest we come to filmed paranoia these days  is 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'Trainspotting,' both of which set a distance between us  and them who are cursed.

For these kinds of films to work, the film within needs to overlap with the film without,  and ideally the additional layer of reality. 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' is the gold  standard in this respect. You also need actors who can shift realities and often play  simultaneous levels. These actors actually play it straight, even the energetic O'Toole  who was layered in 'Lion,' as mentioned and later in 'Favorite Year.'

What we end up with here is a collection of intelligent ideas wrangled by less people less  intelligent. Only twice does this thing thrill:

-when the stunt man unexpectedly falls through the skylight into the whorehouse. That  scene is not only great, it is doubly great because it is pivotal for the film within.

-Hersey's much-celebrated scene when the scenery turns and she moves from the film  (as an old lady) into the film within. This one scene must be the peak of her professional  life, and possibly makes it all worthwhile.

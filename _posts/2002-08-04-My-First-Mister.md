Spoilers herein.

TeeVee has destroyed much of the visual soul of humanity. That's because viewers expect to see an engaging fabric; filmmakers like this one respond. And right off the bat, we have something interesting. Not as interesting as the beginnings of 'Harold and Maude' or 'Ginger Snaps,' but acceptable. Give Brroks credit here: he is given little to world with compared to Busceme in 'Ghost World,' but works very subtly.

But a film is not a long music video; it demands some structure. And here the void of talent is pronounced. But you probably already knew that.

I was so distracted, I focused on two rather solid actresses in the background. For me, Mary Kay's character will always be partly Meg from 'Big Chill,' and she will always be looking for some noble man to impregnate her without penalty. Hope she got her kid this time around, because she plays precisely the same medical personage. Must have been because the director didn't know what she wanted and just asked for something the actor already had.

Carol Kane does her squeeky frenetic character here, as well as she has done elsewhere. In my mind, I will remember her for 'Annie Hall,' Muppet Movie,' and Princess Bride,' and forget these later transgressions.

Ted's Evaluation: 1 of 4: you probably can find something better to do with this part of your life.

IMDB: 4

DaFoe spawned a really interesting tradition in storytelling: the man who is left with nothing and through his ingenuity is able to fabricate an acceptable life. Only incidentally does he have to be a castaway to aid in the setup.

Nevertheless, a slew of castaway stories -- some of them movies -- have followed. Tom Hanks' "Castaway," for all its faults got the key thing right: the man has to be utterly bereft, utterly denied. Then a spark of sheer will allows him to devise, to fabricate and cope. Danger has to be real, with the utmost danger being that he will stop inventing.

This version misses the point. Though there are lots and lots of threats, it seems all you have to do on Mars is dodge behind a rock. No fuss. This fellow does no inventing at all, everything is given to him. Every saving discovery is an accident. There's no invention, no decision to convert what is into what it has to be.

Its a disaster.

Spoilers herein.

The idea behind zombie films is great: films in the genre are so bad that the watcher  becomes a zombie.

For me, this is epitomized in 'Video Zombies' where the world of the "movie in the movie,"  the world of the movie and the supposed 'real' world of the watchers all were collapsed.

Teen zombie movies are especially cool, since so many teens are puppets of forces other  than sentience. And 50's teens make this more obvious though it is more severe now. 

This one doesn't disappoint. The copy I saw was pirated, and badly marred. The stock score  was warbly. It enhanced the whole experience of commies; bad acting; weird science;  imbecilic kids with apparent riches; and essentially sexless girls.

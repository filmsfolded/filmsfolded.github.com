These are some second comments on the new Hamlet, comments that escaped my earlier, hasty posting.

More Bad: The play depends heavily on the audience's belief that God directs regents, and that at some basic level, he is guiding the action. Macbeth and Lear also depend on this. Transposing the role of regent to head of a multinational probably works in terms of power. But it further takes the magic out of the machine of fate. Does anyone believe there is anything divine behind Bill Gates?

More Good: I already mentioned Ophelia as a well-crafted and projected part. I separately mentioned Hamlet and friends were film students. Ophelia is an amateur photographer. After a few days, one image has really stuck. When a wired Ophelia pulls 'remembrances' out of her retro-50's 45rpm carrying case (how many know what that is?), and among them was a rubber duckie, my heart just sank. Few people work with the notion that these were just kids. She scoops up this duck -- it later appears in the fountain with the body. So much past is connotated with this, so much said. This girl will stay with me. I'll remember the Gugg.

I also mentioned how out of place Bill Murray was. It must have been quite a gamble. He always acts by looking at the inside of his forehead, which well serves his invented sort of humor. Just doesn't work here. But the director has done well with his setting. Polonius is not the nattering fool many portray, but actually a wise fellow. This Polonius has an amazing library, placed not for display, but for reference. It could be easy to see that he is brains behind the company. Great use of the set to convey this, even though Murray fights it.

And Another Good Too: There are two problems with the play that this film solves deftly. Why does Polonius' death drive Ophelia mad and to suicide? Here she is already full of angst, and ready to drown herself when she is denied Hamlet. So believable. Another problem in the play. Why does Gertrude drink the cup? In every other production I've seen, it is an accident, an unhappy coincidence. Here, she knows the cup is poison. This director gets a lot of credit in my book.

(Just wish he hadn't taken all the product ads.)

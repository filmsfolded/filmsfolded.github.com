Spoilers herein.

I have a particular sensitivity to the structure of films, especially how they are framed. I  think it is often the case that the important part of the film is the definition of the world  it portrays. The story that populates that world is often as incidental and mechanical as  the specifics of the other machines involved: those that print tickets and make popcorn.

In this case, we have some interesting nesting: a cartoonist who creates fantastic  drawings about his childhood. Then we see some of those drawings come to life. DuVal  and Caine, two actors that could have been great, work at being cartoonish as best they  can. 

The drawings we see are by Berkeley Breathed, who at the time was in an enforced ten  year vacation. His art depends on a kind of severe irony that was damaging his psyche.  What's interesting here is that instead of working in his own world, he adopts that of  another cartoonist, Bill Watterson, also taking an enforced break.

Watterson's world is less severe, more endearing but deeply philosophical and reflective.  The neat thing is that Breathed's drawings here - if you look at them - are neither in his  home world nor that of Watterson's. They are in some insipid other place, where insights  do not exist and people just fill time breathing. He must have seen the movie.

Spoilers herein.

I'm not a fan of this kind of dark humor unless it really takes me places, like Hal Hartley  or Parker Posey's amazing 'House of Yes.' Posey shares a commitment and intensity with  Jane Adams; in fact you can see them both in JJ Leigh's 'Anniversary Party.'

So apart from the by-the-numbers punk encounter, we actually have a filmmaker that  understands her questioning face. That opening shot. An opening shot is an introduction  whatever strange world the filmmaker has fabricated. You only have a couple seconds. 

Few opening shots are as effective as the one here: Jane staring at you, you as surrogate  for the dumpee. You who have brought your own gifts to be rejected. You who are  expected to figuratively kill yourself over the experience.

Watch it for Jane and PS Hoffman. All else is school play with pseudoshocking, thin  material.

Spoilers herein.

The connection between films and reality is slight. Films make their own reality which we then play against real life. Each film paints on a canvas in our minds that has already been covered by previous films.

Unless you have a white spot, a relatively unpainted space, you'll go crazy. This film is your white space. Its not minimalism in the traditional sense -- that involves abstraction. This is a deliberate emptiness that provides as close to non-cinema as one can get. Watching it raises the level of other films you may like, and not because it is bad. White space.

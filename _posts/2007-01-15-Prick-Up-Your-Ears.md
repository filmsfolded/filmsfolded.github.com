Before you enter a film, you need to know something of what is expected of you. What you are to give and what is planned to be given to you.

Stephen Frears disappoints time and time again because he doesn't stick to his bargain, nor does he play with it in a conscious way. He just drifts, not unlike the writer depicted here (and Withnail). Probably, what you have heard about this is that it is a (mostly) true story about a mildly talented writer who enjoyed some success through titillation in London when that was trendy. 

There's some irony in exchanges with Brian Epstein, manager of the Beatles who himself was gay, dancing around Orton's gayness. There's some mild introspection as Redgrave and Shawn (himself an introspective playwright) are the framers of an examination of his life.

Orton's appetites catch up with him, which is scant surprise. Sure, the actors do a good enough, even superb job, but just like the life depicted, it is something well crafted and discarded.

This is not a good film because it has no reason to exist, or for you to visit it. I cannot recall any Frears project that is.

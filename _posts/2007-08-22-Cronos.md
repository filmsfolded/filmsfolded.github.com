I think I have finally found a Spanish-speaking filmmaker that I do not like. He's talented. He understands how to make competent films. He knows what he is about: humanizing cinematic conventions that we know and inherit. Here it is the wholly cinematic notion of zombies. Elsewhere we have other modes. There's a little too much respect given to the inherited notion for my taste. I think he does this because he wants a sort of balance and he's already committed to go into deep intensity on the human dynamics side: tight pathos. 

The problem for me is that he takes both sides seriously. He really does believe that his simple human truths are true. Its the equivalent of deciding a life based on those big-eyed idealistic cartoons of little girls, in fact we get one here. Oh and in Pan's Labyrinth. Its okay by me to use things like this, simple, reliable emotional triggers if it leads us to something deeper or more useful.

In a way, that's what characterizes Hispanic filmmakers, the layering. But not del Toro; there's only one layer with two threads and no depth. 

There is something interesting to say about the device though. Its meant to resemble a beetle with a stinger. Internally (which we see) it is supposed to suggest a clock and there's presumably some significance that we see the gears reverse. Perhaps this was supposed to key somehow with the body parts in jars of our designated rich bad guy. It links with notions of cinematic Orrerries that interest me greatly.

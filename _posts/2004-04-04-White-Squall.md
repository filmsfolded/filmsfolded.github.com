Spoilers herein.

Some things are inherently cinematic: explosions/fireworks, cars, architecture... and  water.

Water is a challenge though. Some projects are built around the opportunities that water  provides: 'Perfect Storm,' 'Master and Commander,' 'Hard Rain,' 'What Dreams May  Come...' and this.

I resaw this today because Peter Weir's project was so conventional and ordinary, I  wanted to remind myself how Ridley did it. This is an overly long, too heavily storied  movie. But the shipboard sequences are pretty masterful. Ridley really understands the  energy of the sea and how it builds architecture. See it for this (and the Dutch  schoolgirls).

Except for the insipid 'find-yourself' wrapper, this is a fine water film.

I'm particularly interested in Scott compared to Weir. Weir made possibly the most  terrifying moments of transportation disaster with this very same actor in 'Fearless.' It  was a relentless buildup with a metaphysical tinkle. This is wholly different,  architecturally based. All the shipboard shots, interior and exterior are framed with  reference to a plane of the ship, except when the ship begins to die.

Then, notice that the left-right rhythm of the camera ceases.

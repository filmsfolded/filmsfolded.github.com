Spoilers herein.

This is the last movie I can recall that really worked well by employing actors in their native roles as celebrities. It works -- I think -- because there are three elements involved: take away any one and the enterprise falls below the threshold of watchability.

--The story works. This is no small matter. It requires both mystery and screen sensibilities. People ascribe this mix to Hitchcock, but that's not really true. He was a cinematic master so far as blocking shots and playing with the difference between what we know and the characters do. But he never was able to center the narrative itself in a purely visual world. Here, the mystery form is reduced to the barest elements: how is the money hidden? how is the killer hidden? And these are pulled off expertly.

--The celebrities work. These celebrities aren't actors in the real sense. They just act the one public character they've created. I do not think we have the equivalent today, just the sexy actress of the moment. But these two really are unique and charming personalities, constructed by their time, that we get to watch.

--The tone works. The tone is one of chic Americans, exhibiting then desirable American stereotypes: intelligent banter and style. The plot is American, so are the villains (including a cowboy!), the money, even the American Express and Embassy locations. But the setting is Paris, and so are Audrey's clothes. Those costumes are like a character unto themselves, adopted into the American sphere while leaving the ridiculous out, like the hapless policemen. He is flummoxed as much by the pajamas of the bodies as the bodies themselves. More about clothes: I think it a uniquely 60's Americanization to be so extreme with the woman's wear, and so casual about the men's (with the suit-shower).

This film premiered shortly after the JFK assassination. What a different world.

I have just watched "Frankenstein," the first horror movie from the Universal series, so I thought it apt to look at the last one from the Hammer series.

Hammer was already dead when they made this, and it shows in the budget. Oddly, this was successful at the box-office, but not enough to save Hammer.

Its a curious concoction, consisting of three parts, not well mixed and with no part dominating. One part is ordinary Hammer, which means a particular style of cheese. A second part was supposed to be the edgy stuff, the black magic stuff which -- supposedly genuine -- was to give the sort of fright that competitors like "Exorcist" were delivering.

Thats a real challenge because then (and even now), we don't have much of a successful cinematic vocabulary to draw on for this specific sort of evil. Less seems to be more. But the Hammer tradition calls for "showing," and we end up with forces that contradict themselves.

Those by themselves would be only mildly interesting. But what seems to have happened is that during the shoot, they introduced a third factor: sex. Now, as clumsily as they handled this, it really is quite interesting what's going on. Sex is inherently cinematic. Satanism is inherently driven by sex. But sex as usually found in film -- at least simple films like this -- is voyeuristic. But it could have worked in a sort of Aleister Crowley way where the rituals and sexual mysteries are conflated. 

Here's what they did instead:

We have an innocent beautiful teen girl as a nun. She has been brainwashed and is under a spell, cloistered in a Satantic order in preparation for a combination of rebirth as Satan by copulation with him. During this time, she has simulated sex with a statue of Satan while the head priest impregnates her mother.

The date is approaching. It seems that her mother (it isn't clear) has another child with the same name, who may be some sort of hybrid between devil and human. This "child" claws its way out of the mother while our young nun experiences it as well. 

That child is sacrificed for the blood by which our young nun is to be baptized and presumably have sex with the priest, after which she will be Satan on earth... or something like that.

So what Hammer does, is a mix of timidity and outrageous boldness. 

There are four scenes in which visual sex is involved. The first is when the priest (Cristopher Lee) has this ritualistic sex with the mother while our nun (played by Nastassja Kinski) is mounted by a Satanic crucifix. This is comic.

Then later, the child is born, the mother's legs bound together so that she has to claw through the body. A full view of the mother's sexual area is shown here. This also could have been powerful with the budget they had but comes off like a high school play with nudity.

Then fast forward to the rushed ending where changes were made after the shoot officially ended. The one change at the very end that gives this some fame is a short shot where the good crusader is tempted by the bad priest with the offer of sex with the briefly nude nun, our Nastassja who appears for a couple seconds fully nude. This also is an opportunity wasted in terms of effect, but has become a famous scene because of her subsequent fame, and the liaison with various filmmakers. Supposedly, the Polanski interest started here.

But before that is the one scene that the film should be famous for. Our girl is on the stone alter, the magical circle surrounds, delineated by an acolyte's blood. The newborn "baby" has been sacrificed and the blood collected, with a couple drops falling on her before the crusader interrupts.

What happens then is disgustingly effective. She is nude on the altar while some small red skinless beast similar to a devilish fetus climbs up and starts to have sex with Nastassja -- whose humping pubes we see from her perspective -- during which she stuffs the whole animal in, becoming "pregnant." This is revealed to have been a vision or spell. But it was so unsettling an image that it tagged the whole failure before and after this as something intended: that is to say it was itself terribly Satanic.

Spoilers herein.

Sure the production values are bad, probably among the worst ever. But this is all a matter of degree, and one man's tolerance is another man's disgust. Relax into this as a matter of Zen cinematic flow.

Then check out the extremely clever construction: It an Alice in Wonderland deal, complete with a dream, a hole, and a character named Alice as the sexual interest. The only creature encountered is a Carroll-like man-animal, neither a robot nor a monster.

The whole thing is imagined by an eight year old, and is completely accurate in being what an eight year old might imagine. Down to the naive notions of sex, galactic conquest and electronic equipment. Its as cheesy at it should be, and pretty smart in the process.

Probably not worth watching, except for the great Elmer Bernstein's sometimes cool score. But a great idea anyway.

This is the director of the pretty fabulous "Muriel's Wedding," something of an icon for me, representing the best of Australian domestic comedy. This is a serious artist, capable of weaving fantasy even in ordinary environs.

But, then again, this is "Peter Pan," something conceived for the stage by a talented playwright and successful as a play from the beginning. So it is generally not tampered with too much, even by that excessive meddler Disney. (I guess Spielberg is beyond the pale.)

So at root, you are going to get the basic play. Which means you have to tolerate all that Victorian bosh, you know the stuff written for children that is really what their parents THINK children like. So you have all sorts of adult notions of children's fears. Its tedious business, really, perhaps even more so than the ponderous Christian allegory of Narnia.

But let's set all that aside and ask whether it is a good movie. You know, movies can be good in spite of their story.

In terms of the ordinary values: Wendy, Tink,, Hook and all the pirates are as good as they need to be. But those two traditions are there for a reason. You know, that the same man play the dad and Hook, and that Pan be played by a female?

The Peter here was obviously cast for his face, and perhaps his willingness to do the strenuous stunts. Better to have found a kid who can actually act. And why not play with the androgyny? The production design and score both seemed unimaginative, unduly safe.

So all in all, it is pretty forgettable. Except for one thing, and that's the dimensional movement.

Movies decided to be the children of stage productions, so we traditionally get lots of horizontal sweep and very little of the vertical. Animation opens up new possibilities.

But at the same time, complex shots involve so many trades, and often so many companies that they are usually kept simple. That means that animation usually looks real, as if it were captured by a physically constrained camera.

Looking back over the last few years of animation, only one special effects company has done better that this, WETA. They've convinced the directors they work with to let the camera sweep in three dimensional knots. Look for them. Usually it rewards in this cinematic thrill.

This film doesn't use WETA, except for some creature makeup. And the camera movements are pretty ordinary except perhaps for the fight amid the ship's rigging at the end.

But the movements of the flying characters are every bit the most complex I have ever seen. There are lots of (rather dopey) extras on the DVD that show you how this was done. It really took a lot of work and the results are pretty exciting, especially when you know these are mostly real people we are seeing.

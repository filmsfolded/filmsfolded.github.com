Spoilers herein.

This is a rare case where the non-US original is vastly inferior to Hollywood remake.

The remake is more polished for sure, and avoids the more laughable shock techniques (negative freeze frames at death). But that's not the reason, even though 'Ringu' was a bigger hit in Japan than 'Ring' in the US.

The reason is that the US screenwriters apparently did some thinking about the matter, and what works. In the original, the emphasis is on the girl and her ability to psychically connect. In the remake, the emphasis is on the evil in the tape itself. That tape acts on its own; the girl is a result, opposite from the cosmology of the Japanese version. The remake supported this in many ways. Remember the fly which moved from within to without and why? Remember all the extra visual meaning the remake added to the tape, like the tree? Remember how the Dad had his own collection of video equipment?

That's because it is a whole lot spookier to be watching a movie and be convinced that movies themselves can be evil. American kids are remarkably sophisticated in this sort of self-reflection (though they stupidly call it irony, go figure). I think way more than half of the Hollywood projects aimed at kids not only use self-reference, but depend on it as a central feature.

It must be pure Hell to be German and live with the sins of the fathers, so openly exposed.

It must be horrible, with fear of doing or thinking the wrong thing with every concept that brushes against the offensive ones. I think of my German friends when I encounter something like this.

I am a citizen of the US, a white citizen, though that hardly matters. Matters of race in the US are a sort of disease, a zone where every impulse has been coded by a repentant society. So odd effects occur. Everything is bulldozed into the same simple narrative that third-graders are taught.

I watch this. If you do not have the opportunity to see it: Al Jolson (a white stage performer) appears in blackface and sings three songs in a somewhat "black" manner. He is wearing a ragged costume and the set has a shack, both intended to convey rural, poor black life.

And we are supposed to be ashamed of this. And yet, it is really a sort of celebration of the energy of black performance. Because the stage uses simple codes, it uses these. Sure, there is something wrong that the stereotype is of poverty, and perhaps joy in the condition of poverty. But that's a separate thing, sort of like equating hip language and jazz.

This is a watching experience that has no direct cinematic value. I suppose it marks something of historic interest but that's not in the thing itself. Still, I am recommending this because it unintentionally makes us confront not the past, but our template for dealing with the past.

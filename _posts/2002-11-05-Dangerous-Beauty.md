Spoilers herein.

Doggone. This could have been a great film. It has a strong, charming redhead and Venice. It has a serious actor as the smitten lover. And it has an interesting ('true') story, the point of which is that passion is desirable: passion in life, in knowledge, in commitment, in creating your own reality. It has that actor's dream where a character becomes an actress, performing on many levels.

But it is wasted. I continue to be astounded by movies with a clear message that are presented in a way that contradicts that moral. What's needed here is a highly articulated passion: a meld of refined mastery of the language, deep history of the art, risk all for the sensuality of it all. And what do we get? one of the least risky, most conservative, plain presentations in recent memory. It is as if the Church won and all movies with passion have to be passionless.

Here we have one of the loveliest creatures in filmdom, and she is lit so badly it is a crime. She needs what was done for Cate Blanchett in 'Elizabeth.' We have possibly the loveliest city on earth, and we see a lot of it in some presumably expensive shots. But we don't FEEL the richness of the architecture. Its a visceral experience, and one that can be done. 'Wings of the Dove' merged redhead passion and Venetian lushness well, and it had a less apt story.

This is a poor, inexperienced director, and it shows. The happy ending was a real disappointment too. Such a marvelous woman deserves to shame the Church for eternity by dying gloriously for her life. More studio boss meddling, those same types shown here as the Church. They damn themselves by their tepid handling of this.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

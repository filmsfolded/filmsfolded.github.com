This is fine. And if you find yourself in it, you'll find it pleasant -- rather like visiting the second tier of beautiful cathedrals. You at once perceive the logic of the thing and are impressed if only because it has your exclusive attention.

But at the same time, you know there are far, far better experiences out there.

You can find this as an extra on "Eros," and you might be better off watching this first. That's because it is easy to forget that Antonioni -- for the last 35 years at least -- has been concerned with how the cinematic eye bends what it sees. 

In this case, Antonioni walks again. And he carries sense with him as he moves, enlivening even something that inherently has life. Moses, by Michaelangelo, the original.

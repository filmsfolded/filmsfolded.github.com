I guess I am glad that Tim Burton is alive and making films if only to keep Depp working and encourage him to take chances. I think it is even worth a ticket from time to time to watch the old boy do something weird that isn't intended as a joke. But Burton's work as a whole seems to be in a rut. He knows how to appear to take chances without actually doing so. 

This time, we have large singing instead of small. Operatic blood instead of human-sized. Long shots instead of simple frames.

I may skip the next couple. Email me to tell me if Depp gets interesting again. 

For me, all the cinematic effects, though large, are tired and ordinary. All the songs big empty balloons. What fascinates me is the love story between Burton and one of the most interesting women in film: Helena. She's earned a place in my imagination just on "Wings" and "Fight," possibly "Novocaine." She matters as a template now and probably will for generations.

Its why it is so interesting the way we have her now: written in, made up and photographed by a man who plainly loves her as deeply as he knows -- and shares that with us because the deepest he knows is how to make her real on screen. Its not just a love story we peer into, its one we participate in. 

Hey, I guess I've talked myself into watching the next Burton project, huh?

Spoilers herein.

37 episodes arranged in nine groups emulating the Divine Comedy, as inspired by Jarmusch. The inspiration for the setting was clearly Tarantino, but using the Saturday Night Live formula of episodes about losers. You would think with all these clever influences, plus panache, a watchable film might result.

I came to this because I did not think I appreciated 'Strike Back' as much as I should have, and thought that by investing in the askew world, I'd get better registration. But this seems so unoriginal, so shallow in concept. I understand that Kevin peaked with 'Chasing Amy.' Got it right here to watch next. But if true, it seems a very short productive life for a filmmaker, and the only thing he has to offer is a view of slackers that is not based on grossout humor. Well, in comparison, I suppose that seems intellectual and explains why some IMDB viewers have pushed this into the list of top 200 films of all time ever, anywhere.

Jarmusch finds fascination with the pathetic, but he does do by honestly entering their world, a la Truffaut but with more commitment. Jarmusch's camera spends a lot of time in the silences, which reduces the distance. Kevin tries the X ironic route, wanting it both ways. He wants us to enter this world as equals in the fashion of jarmusch, but he also wants us to get some laughs at the same characters. Can't have it both ways, at least not at the level of talent we have here.

Tarantino inherits gravity from the past by casting prior film tropes in biblical terms, using them with respect. That inheritance from the film world is what gives Pulp Fiction its richness. Kevin also uses a classical framework, Dante. But it is all skewered: the 37 episodes are called blow jobs and treated as such. (I was missing this bit of key information when encountered with the primary motif of blow jobs in 'Strike Back.')

The film references are blunt: one of the clerks works at a video store (as did Tarantino) but goes to another to rent his own video -- a porno film featuring hermaphrodites (both ways again). There is a discussion by proles about proles being incidentally murdered in a blockbuster film. The rooftop hockey game shows signs of being a reference to 'Slapshot.' But none of this has the energy required to bring cinematic life to the adventure.

Films of famous books are great fun because you have a multiple experience. You recall the book, you see the movie. You may recall other movie versions, each with a crowd of creative decisionmakers surrounding it. So you get to "experience" them all, and the relationships between them all and think about the decisions that went into them. Its a huge, integrated story whose existence indicates the processes that is for us to discover.

So when the source is a mystery, it becomes ever so multilayered, and Christie is the best for this sort of thing. 

This is the first of the new Marples I have seen, and I'm glad I picked it. The Hickson version had such extremes of good and bad, the bad coming mostly from an adapter who just doesn't understand Christie. The good coming from a director who does.

In this case, its the opposite. In the previous version, we got a sort of "rashomon" as a specific few minutes were repeated, each time from a different narrative perspective and with new information. That's missing here. I liked it as a device but it wasn't very Agatha. Her method was always to play in the story, relentlessly veering when we expect to go forward. This story has four things that are not as they seem, and it only works if we keep on the road. This version does.

Its less fun if what you want is the BBC model, where we don't work on the solution and cocreate the world, instead just relax and be amused by the clever ending. Its more fun -- if you like life, literature and thought -- to actually play the game Agatha played.

One element of that game was that the characters were outrageous. Its entirely appropriate for the film characters to be overacted. Sure. Another element of the Marple game was that the written Marple character was without appeal. She had no charm, no hidden, endearing twinkle. She was an old maid busybody with a surprising mind that worked in invisible ways. That her thought processes were invisible complicated the notion of the mystery story, placing her halfway between the writer (who knows what happened) and us.

This Marple does that far better than Hickson's. Sure Hickson's is more appealing, but if you want appeal, go to one of those dreadful TeeVee things done by Angela Landsbury. 

And the end? I am sure that Christie would have approved. She's all about the unexpected twist. There already were four. To add a fifth makes sense. She couldn't have done it in her day, booksex being what it was. We still have constraints that our grandchildren will wonder about, but we can have this twist and I welcome it. If you know Tara's other work, it'll be particularly sweet.

Its why she was chosen, I'm sure.

Spoilers herein.

The premise behind Frank Herbert's 'Dune' series was not rare among that generation of science fiction writers: the reality he 'created' was believed to actually exist in the reader's mind before he arrived and was merely brought into remembrance. Herbert died before 'Tremors' (or 'Lair of the White Worm') appeared, but he would be pleased that his creature -- among other of his inventions -- has been adopted by film rather like the vampire has. Herbert's worms are the source of all higher thinking, and the good guys are separated from the bad in how they understand and accept the worm.

This treatment has a bunch of dopes trying to kill the worms, which makes great sense because the film is cast as a self-parody rather like many teen movies these days. They pander to the audience by sinking to the lowest level, but the message is one that makes fun of that level. Its ironic irony, and could only be possible with the help of the worm. So this film folds that by going one step further: making fun of itself by having the inhabitants of Perfection kill the worms. Lots of poking fun at the stupidheads, but you have to be one to appreciate the jokes.

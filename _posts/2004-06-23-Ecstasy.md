Spoilers herein.

I liked this film. No, it wasn't because of Lamarr's nude beauty (which incidentally consisted  of an innocent yearning look, a mustache, painted migratory eyebrows and - by today's  standards - fat thighs).

Nor was it for the artistic cinematography and pacing. These _are_ interesting and unusual  for the period, but not unique or particularly apt.

What I liked was the ending, which most viewers seem to think was incongruously tacked on.  Here's what happens in the first acts: tragic sex, then she leaves.

An important film - one well composed and worth - has a strong ending. Throughout this  film we're given copious visual analogies to make clear that what we see is the simple  working of the powerful wheels of nature. So after she leaves does the world fall apart? Does  the lover pine? Is there even a blip in the dance of humans and nature? No.

It is a little blunt, but clever way of turning inside out everything we saw previously.

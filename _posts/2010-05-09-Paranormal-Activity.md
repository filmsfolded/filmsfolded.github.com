There are some obvious lessons here, lessons about fear being more about what you do not see.

Lessons about economy in explanations, and establishing an anchor of reality by spending time in ordinary dialog.

But I am a folding nutcase, so will mention the structure:

We are watching a film, of a film that becomes -- in sly degrees -- the enclosing film. It is of a demon that becomes -- in precisely the same sly way and using the same scenes -- one of the characters. Actually it is both if you pay attention, because it matters that the tape is made.

Why? The boyfriend is not behind showing us the thing. The demon is. Track the motive.

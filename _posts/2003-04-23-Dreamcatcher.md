How tough it must be to be a best selling but uncelebrated writer. King earned his reputation on a simple strength: the ability to create a straight, singlethreaded story that engaged. The goal was to literally create a sustained series of cliffhangers so that readers would be addicted to what comes next. He worked with the bizarre in doing so.

But other writers were making money too, accomplishing this in easier ways, notably using the shuffle effect. Here, you have many, many characters and stories that interweave in ways to be discovered. Each story needs its local motivations, and each its resolution. By shuffling back and forth, you force your reader to make an investment which keeps them engaged. The stories themselves and manner of writing can be less clever.

Here is King trying that on for size. Here is King discovering that it is hard for him to make each story trivial. He cannot help himself; he grows each of the bits as large as he can, with the blind intention of making each bizarrely charming. Its an odd irony: here is a device crafted for bad writers that in the hands of a good writer produces bad writing.

Watch as he builds too much of the competing government conspiracies and personal agendas therein. Watch as he overloads the metaphors of threat: captured dreams, captured thoughts and memories, captured bodies, poisoned cities, the capture of government by conspirators within, the loss of individuals minds through SIDDS, the destruction of all humans. Watch as he conflates the ironies in physical spaces: the cabin and the 'memory warehouse.' Watch as he stumbles and gives lessons to contemporary writers everywhere.

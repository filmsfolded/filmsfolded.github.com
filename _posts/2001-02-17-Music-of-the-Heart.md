Spoilers herein.

Meryl is such a locomotive, she can pull any tractor of a film. This film has cute kids, adequate performances, a story with heart -- at least potentially. But the directing is so leaden, and the story so trite that she can't get very far with it.

Why does Hollywood have such trouble with films about music and mathematics? They are drawn to these themes because they have such power, and when one individual connects with another, or a group, the results can be life-altering. So when we have a film that goes directly for the life-altering center, we can expect much.

Streep could be up to this, if anyone could, at least from the delivery end.

But when we end up with a film about mathematics, it completely misunderstands what math is (like 'Good Will') or concentrate on arithmetic (as in the juvenile 'Pi'). Only Greenaway connects with math, but his connection isn't intimate, blissful, instead abstract and distant.

So most films focus on music because at least you have the performance. But then that is all we get, a filmed performance. Can't there ever be any artists involved? Can't they ever connect with the magic? Check out 'Jackie and Hillary' for a taste of what I mean. This film is among the least musical of music films -- it is by and for people who know nothing about music. Heck, it could have been a basketball film -- and actually was in former incarnations.

A more interesting film would have been how the teacher REALLY got the big names involved. That would have been the beginning of a thread that lead to the making of this film. Somebody knew somebody.

It is a real shame that we cannot keep our best actresses busy on deserving projects.

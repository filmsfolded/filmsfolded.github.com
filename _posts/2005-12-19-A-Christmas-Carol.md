When asked for a concentrated education on film-making and appreciation, I point querents to films made by different teams of the same story. The Alien films were a sort of epiphany for me, so radically different. I've since tracked "Alice in Wonderland" movies and spinoffs, a large number. Even more radically diverse.

The Dickens Christmas tale is a bit better in a way because you can only deviate from the story so much. This version changes the story to prune the past (no engagement, scant Fezziwig) and enhance the "present:" more Cratchets, more street stuff.

When you take away the historical reason why Scrooge hates Christmas, and the world in general, the story makes less sense. But the less sense is a deliberate decision here. This presentation is intended to be remote, stagy. The characters aren't supposed to be portraying real people, instead they are presenting characters that are fictional. The acting is self-aware with faces and poses that you would only see in Currier and Ives plates.

So it is a couple layers deep. It is a movie about a story about a series of stories told by ghosts. To place us in the position that Scrooge was in, it has to be this abstract.

Smart choice. But it is too far over the top for us now, I think.

Here's an interesting fact: this movie is closer to the writing of the story in time than it is to us now. Think about that. Amazing, huh?

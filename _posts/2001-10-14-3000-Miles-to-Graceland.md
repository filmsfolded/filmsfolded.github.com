Spoilers herein.

This is drek because the actors are lousy, the director doesn't have a center, and the narrative is unfocused. But you knew that.

But if poorly written, it is pretty intelligently conceived. Think about the problem of the poor writer. Most film genres are going through a period of accelerated evolution. Copying old formulas in the sense of copying the essence of the whole film doesn't work anymore: if a specific film hits, the studios copy it exactly as a 'sequel' until it burns out.

Tarrantino was the most self-promoting of a breed of 'samplers,' who changed the game of formula. Samplers copy elements of prior films in an overtly self-referential way: the quote is supposed to be obvious. The problem is not a lack of riches to quote, rather a challenge of novel composition.

So the race for intelligent artifice is on. 'Moulin Rouge' was a masterful combination of self-reference, satire and straightahead manipulation. Lots and lots of different solutions are appearing, many rather clever. So here we have a first time writer who starts from first principles: what are the basics of artifice to build on?

Elvis himself was a serial impersonator who spawned a whole cult of impersonators. So that's a possibly rich skeleton, especially if the director is someone from the music video world, which is nothing but cinematically-enhanced posturing of celebrities. Add in the familiar device of thieves who are constantly revealing their motives to have been impersonations. Add in Las Vegas, which has cinematically rich gaudy, fake frippery, and some balletic shootouts. Finally add in some Tarrantino insurance: all the characters should be lowlifes.

I think this could have been made to work. Parts of it have elsewhere. The lowlife transit of violence was painted well in 'Kalifornia, ' even in 'U Turn.' The choreographing of shootouts as an effect of random fate was recently done well in 'Way of the Gun.' Elvis. Las Vegas, robber doublecrosses many times.

So while this was a failure, and even though it had poor Kevin, it is an interesting failure. If you are like me and are interested in how societies mature, drift, evolve or get buffeted, you'll be interested in this. Its like watching the news. You expect it to be mostly bad, but you watch anyway.

Side comment: wasn't the abused daughter at the gas station wonderful? The credits confuse on who she is. It is a small part, and she cheated by playing Julianne Moore. But she was great in her three minutes.

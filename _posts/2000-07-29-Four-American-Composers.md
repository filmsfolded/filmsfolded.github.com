I was able to gain access to only two of the 4 one-hour segments, those on Monk and Ashley. I believe them to be representative. I viewed them looking for Greenaway magic. Now that's too bad because I know the work of Cage and Glass, and have some appreciation of them. Of Monk and Albert, I can only report that they require someone more attuned than I to fashion in the art world. I suspect these two have already been forgotten.

The presentation is TeeVee documentary, recording the artists' performances (several in the case of Monk). All the art here is that of the documented artist, not of the filmmaker. So if you are looking for Greenaway, don't waste your time.

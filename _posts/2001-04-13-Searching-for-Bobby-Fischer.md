Spoilers herein.

The best films of course are those where the level of work from every artist is high and it all comes together in a visual symphony. Second best are the onedimensional ones where the skill of a single artist is played out. I find these particularly interesting to watch because you can often see the wires and scaffolding of that person's art.

When that person is an actor, you get a film about acting ('Wag the Dog'), when a set designer, you get 'Titus' (or 'Casper'). Usually, when the person in charge is a writer, you get a story about writing or a similar art. This is great writing, in the sense of effective screenwriting. And so it is here, the focus for us is on creative vision. The problem is that there are two stories here and the lesser one detracts from the more powerful, the one we are meant to see.

The lesser story is about a father struggling with parenting a prodigy, with a backstory of Pandolfini's monkey. These are Hallmark parents and a simple drama. While slick, it is trivial. Unfortunately, this is the film that Horner scores, Hall photographs, and which most people will see. In this film, chess is a bunch of jumpcuts, and clock slaps and is there merely as a learning tool.

Early on, Pandolfini gives a problem. The kid says he can't visualize without moving the pieces, so the pieces are swept away. Similarly. it is easier to see what is going on in this film without the distraction of actually being lead by the actors. There's a deeper film here, if you care to sweep away the pieces. Fortunately for us, there is a homeopathic power to this second film -- the less it is shown, the more powerful it is. But it is there, haunting, just as Fisher himself haunts.

Chess is the most cinematic of intellectual constructs: it is literally visual logic, evolved to be deliberately beyond the complexity a mind can handle. A 'player' works with imperfect situational visions, fragments of consciousness, roles not at all unlike certain styles of acting. You _project_. One can make a film about genius in chess far more readily than in math or music, because the nature of the game is cinematic. It literally descends from the same tree of imagination of storytelling, and is the first and still richest interactive narrative. Alas, though we have a world-class cinematographer here, he is not allowed to focus on the game itself. No matter, imagination is stronger.

So far as the styles of acting, it is a matter of genius to cast Fishburn against Kingsley, because their approaches to acting mirror the approaches to chess their characters play. Kingsley is disciplined, controlled, focused; Fishburn intuitive, personal, unpredictable.

Winning a chess game is the rudest metric of excellence, and befits, well, a baseball-playing oaf of a father. So it is a letdown that we have the formulaic end of a victory -- it is as if the game were treated like, well, pinochle. But that's the movie that you are supposed to ignore.

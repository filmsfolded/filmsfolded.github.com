Spoilers herein.

I've seen now four films that are a direct result of 9-11 - non-military films that is: 'Red,  White and Blond,' 'Seabiscuit,' 'Dawn of the Dead (remake)' and now this.

Wrapped in Herzog's fog from 'Heart of Glass' and Horner's typically overwhelming score is  a ordinary tragedy. The tragic form is simple: wheels turn and people's lives spill into  unexpected unhappy directions. So typical is the form that these unhappinesses have come  to be actually called 'tragic.'

Trivial tragedy focuses on the people themselves and the small things that nudge them this  way and that. It is trivial in the sense that is it a mere clockworks, interesting only to see  what bell chimes next, like those great machines of balls and ramps one used to see in malls  and airports. 

This film is trivial tragedy, nearly melodrama... Don't be fooled into thinking it important or  useful or moving just because cultural issues are involved and people die.

Important tragedy focuses on the machinery behind, the great wheels and forces that move  and incidentally throw off harmful sparks. Greek tragedy had the device of the gods;  Shakespeare invented more human machinery and lesser talents have superficially copied  ever since.

There have been some good production values brought to bear here: everyone has the  appropriate intensity. This first-time director has at least understood the slow exploitation  of these trivial intensities. But even the normally reliable Deakins gets caught up in the Rube  Goldberg mechanics. No one laughed, but they don't have to for it to be farce.

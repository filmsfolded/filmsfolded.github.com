Spoilers herein.

I will admit that this is very skilled storytelling: I am really impressed with how singlemindedly every element of this film is coordinated to give a single feel which sustains -- it has to because there is no story development to speak of. So rather than focus on managing evolution of drama, 'Iron' focuses on evocation of a single 'feel.' And they do that well enough for me. I actually did participate in those duck and cover drills.

What I find more interesting is the approach they took to the production of the film, which I find highly self-referential, and which may be the cause of a subtle effect for the viewer. At least I like to think so.

The giant is drawn not by a human animator -- instead it is a three-dimensional model created in the computer. The computer then 'renders' the 2-D image according to directions. The resulting figure is assembled in a scene that has hand-drawn human characters. In a very real sense, this character of a robot is acted by a robot, while the human characters are 'acted' (drawn) by humans.

As with all cartoony films, the voices are what you really 'see' so far as the drama. But in terms of the images -- which is what all film experiences are about -- what you really see is a conflict among the religions of animators very much like what you see on the screen. That it is set in a pre-computer, but post-nuclear age -- that the lines drawn are not ones of coexistence but of good and evil -- says a lot about Bird's take on all this. 

A very intimate and effective film on filmmaking. Probably shouldn't be on IMDB's 'science fiction' list though.

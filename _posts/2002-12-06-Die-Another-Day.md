Spoilers herein.

I suppose you know by now that this is a dud, and why. What amazes me is when so my money is on the line, why not spend a few quarters and get some talent involved? I know this can be done, because amidst the blockbuster livestock droppings we have encountered this year is the 'Chamber of Secrets' project. Now in this case, there's some really big bucks involved -- not so many more in the cost of production, but in the potential payoff in the aftermarket for the king of the franchise series.

That film had an art-film consciousness in how it used space. Probably cost them a tenth of a percent of the budget to get some clever artists involved. But not here: superficially we have the same formula: good girl and bad; evil, world-aspiring maniac and his assassin character; episodic gimmick-action; multiple exotic locations; bedhopping babes; blaring music. But not a single one of these registers on the Bond-o-meter.

Its as if a once-influential character when through a DNA swap and came out the other end as a lifeless bag of energy determined to herd us like sheep, after a torture session. Oops. I gave it away.

The redhead Moneypenny is sexier than Berry. Wow, wouldn't Saffron Burroughs have been good? All beauty beyond shape is created, and Saffron knows a few things about the camera that Berry does not.

The one thing I found interesting was the ice palace, where much of the action takes place. It's a strange mix of styles: mostly Macdonald's meets Sydey Opera House on the outside: lot's of swoops and drama. But dreary Turkish masonry-like inside. I suppose they were done by different people, different firms even.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4: You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

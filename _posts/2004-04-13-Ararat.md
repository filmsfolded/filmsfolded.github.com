Spoilers herein.

I think Egoyan is one of our best living filmmakers. He layers his stories in ways that  some layers generate or reinterpret others. 

Usually, this is apparent to the viewer. In this case, the viewer is fooled into thinking that  this is film reminding of an atrocity padded with a bunch of other stuff. No, that other  stuff is the important stuff, the generator of layers about invented memory and the  nature of film representation.

Stories and truth. And history and whether film can ever reflect reality. This is Oliver  Stone in reverse. I would have it on my must life experiences, but I limit any filmmaker to  only two entries on that list.

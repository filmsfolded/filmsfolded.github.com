Spoilers herein.

Great film transports us to unfamiliar places in such a way that we are given enough familiarity to have it register. 

This is whole, consistent -- a real vision that sticks. It is easier, I suppose, when it is a performance of a performance.

But is it an affair like Horrock's 'Little Voice'? Is it love?

It is for now anyway.

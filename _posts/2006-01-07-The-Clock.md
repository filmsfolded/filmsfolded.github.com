I hate movies like this, you know the ones that have one stellar element in the midst of garbage.

First, the garbage. I love Judy Garland. I do, but here she is asked to fill a vessel so alien that I fear when watching her. We know she has a somewhat appealing figure only because of the heavy drugs she is addicted to. We know she can be photographed as a beauty by someone who is in love with her.

But her romantic simpleton is so false, so full of effort and a will to please, it made me cry. 

The story is one of those things that is supposed to endear: war love, instant love, naturally fated love. When new, it would have been as natural a notion as flowing water. But after some ugly wars and loss of institutional pretense, the notion does seem ugly now. At the beginning, for instance is some supposed humor when the female roommate talks incessantly while the boyfriend repeatedly starts to say something. It actually offends.

But if you can let all the suspicious smells hide under the excuse of innocence, there are some rewards.

Though Minnelli abuses his future wife, he caresses the viewer with some wonderful camera compositions. The best ones, at least the most dramatic ones, have movement and/or overheads.

Minnelli wasn't a giant in the art, but he did innovate in a few areas and he extended this notion of the curious eye. I'll ask you to watch this for one shot that will stick with you forever.

Judy and her accidental beau find themselves delivering milk in Manhatten. One of the stops is at a fire station. The shot lasts less than a minute and took incredible setup. It starts on a metal-framed balcony, follows characters down a similar spiral stair and then across the firehouse proper to settle on some kittens lapping milk from a saucer.

I rate my films as films, but an equally useful rating system would note the best scenes. This has almost nothing to do with the story and is short. But it will stick with you forever, and is even supported by the romance of the surrounding story.

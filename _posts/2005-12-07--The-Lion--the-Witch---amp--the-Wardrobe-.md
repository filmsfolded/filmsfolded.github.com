The original stories are quaint enough. They are that sort of children's story that parents can read and see as cartoonishly simple and obvious, as if kids needed dumb things. In this case, that reduction and moralizing is engineered to appeal to parents by literally being a Christian "allegory." I'll set aside what it means to value allegory as if it were useful. You'll have to decide that for yourself.

I watched this in preparation for the December 2005 version that threatens to be big and star a favorite of mine, Tilda Swinton.

This version is perfectly apt. The story has that feel of naivety in it and the cheap production values of the fantasy in this version match that exactly. It looks as if it actually valued its obvious childishness, as if it were drawn by a child while being told by a child.

So you have the three simplicities aligned: the simple cosmology of a radically reduced religious vision, the childish, almost retarded simplicity of the allegory in the story, and the similarly overt cartoonishness of the production.

The star always has to be the queen. The good guys are too cosmic for theatrics, so the bad girl is the center. This one is suitably loud.

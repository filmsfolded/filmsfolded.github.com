Spoilers herein.

The film industry has a significant problem in engineering sequels. Even a modest hit compels a sequel, the only question being the budget. Brent Maddock/SS Wilson are no dummies, and presumably stay current with various theories of how to handle the problem. The original had Frank Herbert's worms, which were the source of all insight, and a bunch of rednecks intent on killing them. The result wasn't particularly clever, but did succeed in poking fun at the type of bozo who watches these movies.

So how to handle the sequel: you have the monster evolve of course, but now you can also evolve in who you make fun of. Now you can make fun of your own original as well as your audience and any eggheads out there. And that's all that happens here. Fortunately, the effort matches the slightness of the budget, unlike the grotesque 'Wild Wild West.'

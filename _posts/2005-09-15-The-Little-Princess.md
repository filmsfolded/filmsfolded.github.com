It is a sad fact that you only get out of stuff as much as you train your self to. In the case of movies, you must steep yourself in a few historical origins: detective stories, noir, dance. That means you have to sit through many bad movies, or at least ordinary ones, to see how the conventions developed.

"Big" 1930s movies are a must.

If you don't understand the vocabulary you use to think with, you cannot really think. 

This little picture is dreadful, a sickly sweet tale told in the simplest of terms, almost as if it were for a ten year old.

But there are two things of interest.

The first is that all the things you usually expect at the end of such a movie happen in this case after the movie stops. There's a witchy schoolmarm, in one scene made up as the wicked witch from the "Wizard of Oz" of the same year. She will get burnt, we know.

There is the disenfranchised grandson who married secretly and was wounded. We know he will reconcile with his crabby but kindhearted and rich grandfather.

We have the stagestruck brother who we know will have a rewarding return to the stage. And of course the centerpiece is the bankrupt, mad, wounded Captain Crewe who we know will be restored to his riches and daughter.

There's even a hint that some relationship with Queen Victoria will ensue.

But all of this is implied, to occur after the ending placard. I know of no other example where the dramatic conventions were so closely, slavishly followed until near the end, and then so blatantly disregarded.

It shocks. It seems modern and ironic. But I suppose the explanation may simply be that someone thought the movie too long. But even the idea that such a thing would be palatable is remarkable.

The other interesting thing is the use of redheads. Now this is early Technicolor and it was widely thought that redheads would "show" better. I am doing a small study of how redheads became important in films and this Technicolor rule helped give that trend a push.

Here we have Shirley, a blond, with red coloring washed in. Her friend the teacher, Rose, is naturally red. But the most remarkable rednesses occur in a dream sequence. Shirley is in a Snow White garb, the schoolmarm as a witch. Shirley as a princess has a ballet performed to entertain her. (She appears both as the princess watching and one of the dancers.)

Every one of the dancers has had her hair dyed red. It is quite something.

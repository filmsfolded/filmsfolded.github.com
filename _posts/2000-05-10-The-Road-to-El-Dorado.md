The old TV show 'Sky King' spent half its time on the adult hero flying around with the adolescent Penny scouring the landscape, with her periodic reports that she saw nothing interesting. I feel this way when I go to these mundane time-fillers. But there are a few layers worthy of attention we can see from a height.

The first is the style itself. Cartoonists are like other filmmakers in that they stand in the footprints of those who went before. Their palette is one of quotes and references but with the references particularly noticable. Here, the directors chose to depict a legendary quasi-place and chose to make it like Pepperland of 'Yellow Submarine' fame. The water effects are wholly new, but that is a matter of emerging technology, and of course we have pyramids. But once the heros arrive in the fabled city, it is all Pepperland (and the opening credits as well). Interesting. I suppose the reference is from the fabulous nature of the places and not the use of hallucinogens by the Maya. Except, well except the treatment given of the priest's magic which is wholly psychotropic.

Another observation is the evolving exploitation of exotic cultures in kiddie fare. Africa (in 'Lion King' and 'Tarzan'), the Mideast (in 'Aladdin' and the Moses thing), India (in the Kipling thing I didn't see) and Algonquian America have all taken their turn at neocolonialism, reinvention of truth, and propagation of stereotypes. But here we have a new, rather interesting insult.

The Spanish perpetuated the greatest genocide in history until then by killing 2/3 of South and Central America just for gold (and crazy religion). (This was the worst in history until the Belgians killed 10 million Africans in their greed for rubber.) By the time of the First English colony, the Spanish had already imported a million Africans as slaves, because the Maya and other indigenous people didn't make good slaves. Today, in Mexico, the Maya still resist assimilation after over four hundred years. Now, the Mexicans are the cruel oppressors, still with the Spanish language, religion and governmental system.

So much remarkable (and even entertaining) could be said of/shown about these people (who still don't even speak Spanish). But what do we get? The characters are Mexicans! We won't know the difference, right? But wait, it gets worse, Rosie Perez isn't Mexican but Puerto Rican, and in fact was born and raised in New York City. So we have a presumably real West Side 'watchagonnado Â‘boutit' person standing for a Mexican cartoon, standing for the European Hispanic stereotyped woman (big legs, big boobs, big lips), standing for a Maya. 

Now that's interesting. 

Penny, can you see anything through the clouds?

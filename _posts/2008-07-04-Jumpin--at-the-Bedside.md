Sometimes you stumble upon interesting experiences in strange corners like old soft porn. Sometimes not.

This was not. I sought it out in reaction to "Belle de Jour." Its a much celebrated movie, economical and deep. But the economy is too self assured and overstated, and the depth is only by reference to other films and life. Being loved, sexual companionship, loneliness, all only referenced for us to flesh out.

Here's much the same story done in much the same way. Except the economy here is a matter of cinematic incompetence, but should it really matter? And the tone is light humor colored by voyeurism rather than a dark meditation on the lonely nature of the soul.

But for me, these are one and the same. And in both cases, it all depends on the actress. There are some things you cannot invent, and seductive distance is one of them. Deneuve is a good actress who actually understands the various disturbances her directors plan. But she just wasn't able to carry her film.

This belle is played by Vivi Rau, already a regular porn star. This is her first soft core role. She made a career in being sexual with innocent looks, with an open face. She had already lived what she was showing. Catherine never did.

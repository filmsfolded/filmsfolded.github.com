Spoilers herein.

I credit Tarkovsky with genius, PLUS he was able to use that genius to create a few of the  world's most powerful films.

This isn't one of them. This is obviously a film made not from his soul but to run through  some jackbooted superior's checklist. It is cloyingly sentimental. It actually tells an  unambiguous story rooted in reality. It has some competent framing and images, but  they don't annotate the situation in the unique fashion that he would when in his stride.

Tarkovsky's genius was in creating a netherworld halfway between non-film reality and  Joycean dreamstate. He was further able to sustain visual meditations, often for a very  long time, on elements of that world. Frequently, those elements would trigger  lifealtering poetic constructions in one's mind, different in each viewer. There's none of  that here. You may be disappointed unless you stay away.

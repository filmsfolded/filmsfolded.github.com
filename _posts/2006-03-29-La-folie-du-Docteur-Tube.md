I'm doing my homework for an anticipated viewing of "Napoleon" and "I Accuse" though I suppose I'll have to settle for now with bootleg versions on small screens.

Toward that end, I begin with this little thing. Let me describe it. A mad scientist is working in his lab, with a black servant. The scientist is mad, and has an extreme extension to his bald head.

He has invented some sort of powder that alters space when sprinkled on beings in that space. The distortions of space may have been accomplished with bent mirrors, or perhaps lenses. Its a bit perverse and ends with the doctor putting his head in a cage. This last bit is inexplicable and quite disturbing.

The whole deal lasts 6 minutes or so. It seems to fold what the doctor sees as he becomes drug addled with what we see. That much is clear immediately, which is why the head in the cage is so very spooky.

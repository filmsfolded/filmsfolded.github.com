I suppose everything you need to know about this can be gleaned through the title. It refers to a family named Stone that assembles for Christmas and goes through certain dramas expected for the form. It also concerns a certain heirloom gem that is the "touchstone" for the main dramatic thread. And finally we will discover that all is resolved by the actions of the stoner brother. He's the William Hurt character you'll recall from "Big Chill." 

That notion of superficial complexity, of accessible folding is what characterizes this. Some writers actually tagged it as "intelligent." The selection of Diane Keaton was supposed to lend a sort of "Annie Hall" flavor to the thing, referring to a project that actually pulled this off -- accessible narrative shifts.

It all comes down to your tolerance for the obvious and the humor of embarrassment -- mine isn't very high.

There is one writerly thing that makes this less nauseating than it would otherwise be. The "odd" brother is gay, according to the formula. But he is also deaf. It is inserted into the environment with no dramatic elaboration, the only such character quality not mined so. That's because it is there to help the writer when he shifts into his role as director.

I must admit this was an intelligent decision. There cannot be many things harder to film engagingly than a family in a house, often around a dinner table. The problem is one of conversation. In the real world, all the events associated with the drama would be in conversations, usually intimate ones shaped by corners and cubbies.

Bezucha changes all that. Everyone in this family "signs" their conversations so that the deaf sibling can "hear" them. It is a small thing in a way, but it changes the equation of how we engage with what we see on screen. It gives us something to see so we can "hear." Give the man points for this understanding. If you are one of the film students reading this, take note.

I won't give a spoiler here, but toward the end there is a topless scene that exploits this signing. Its shocking and effecting.

Spoilers herein.

Yet another story about injustice righted. About a conspiracy of power (government or corporate), against an admirable hero. This would be a much more powerful story if they stuck to the truth. Carter WAS a thug -- that we couldn't be equally outraged knowing this is patronizing. The other smarmy elements (the relationship with Lisa, the drugs in the commune) would have helped as well.

The writing and directing is dreary, and the two and a half hours or so drag. Jewison is not a first-rate director. What's interesting is Denzel. I just hit him hard two days ago for 'Titans.' He was mugging not acting, and supporting an irresponsible reduction of truth that I thought reduces society. I do have problems with this story as well, but I have to give Denzel his due as an actor.

First, let's note that we have some very fine black actors. There's no lack of appreciation of talent in this regard. Consider (among the younger crowd) Laurence Fishburn, Don Cheatle, Cuba Gooding, Forest Whitaker, Samuel Jackson, Delroy Lindo, Denzel, A few comedians. All of these have had some very respectable work. I've listed them from what I think is best to worst. Note: Denzel is just above Eddie Murphy (who is no slouch).

Denzel is committed, no question. But his effort shows. Its not supposed to. You don't notice it so much when the character is supposed to be intense. But that's cheating. In the first part, he plays an angry man -- in the last half by fits and starts, different types of intensity. Newspaper critics applaud intense roles, but the calm ones, acting naturally, are much harder.

There was a time when he tried. He was very controlled in 'Much Ado,' really very good. There were moments in 'Blue Dress' where I thought we were watching a major talent. But with fame comes that hungry ego which ruins the self that must go away when acting. This is a very sad film. In the character of a man who has lost his chance at greatness, we have an actor who has lost his chance at greatness to the prison of celebrity. That's the real tragedy of our society: how it eats people.

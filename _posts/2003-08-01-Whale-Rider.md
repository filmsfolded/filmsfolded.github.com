Spoilers herein.

A simple film, with a single rather obvious and agreeable moral, native people,  endearing faces, magical whales and nice scenery. Straightahead storytelling and we all  cried.

There isn't a barnacle of irony in this, and the structure consists of the past and the  modern present with the notion that both have elements of value. But I saw many more  layers in conflict. The most obvious: to a North American, these are New Zealanders,  European in every respect except their faces. They speak in that British chirp that has a  unique cadence. Their thoughts are formed and phrased within a very specific Kiwi  manner: pay attention to what the Grandmother says and how. It is shockingly non- indigenous.

What we have is an odd mix of movie/storyland magic imposed on traditional legend,  both imposed on a people who have the colonial value imposed on them that they  should be 'genuine.'

Okay, we could probably sort all that out, if it were not for the overt feminist message,  nearly: 'women of the world, unite.' Somehow, instead of cheering for a character, we  are cheering for one of these layers to vanquish another. In other words, native dignity  is respected except when it gets in the way of our own limited way of observing; then we  turn what we see into a Victorian drama. Just consider how the notion of blame and guilt  is handled. No native Maori could have thought that way: it is purely a European  invention. It may not matter to you. But if you use films like this as part of building a  life, perhaps it might.

Pai is wonderful. What is it about 12-14 year old actresses that so many of them do so  well?

A common poster for the movie has Pai working string figures (cat's cradle) while  viewing her Dad's art slides. Apart from the stick training - and related to it and the art -  this would have been the only native activity in the film. But I failed to see it in the  finished film. Too bad

I'm grateful for any Cyd Charisse appearance, even if it is a bungled musical with a by now distractingly ugly Fred Astair and desperate Peter Lorre. I'm not expert enough in musicals to see precisely what went wrong and how it could have been fixed. But this gives the impression of tiredness: the numbers don't have any energy or cleverness: the cinematic nature of the thing is lacking; and the story (even though it worked before) is insufficient to move things along.

This isn't quite Cyd: she is made to act with an oddly stilted accent. But she has one rather terrific dance sequence (thankfully not choreographed by the then lazy Hermes Pan) where she transforms herself from the grim appara-chick to a "modern" woman, going through two stages of underwear that couldn't possibly have been worn under the final getup. Its the centerpiece of the whole thing and presumably where the title comes from.

Oh, and there's another redhead here. This was in the heyday of reds (Technicolor, you see) so we got a sexy one and a library-type one.

If you rent the DVD, there is a far, far superior short musical on it: "Paree, Paree."

By the way, this is where Jim Critchfield got his characters of Boris and Natasha for the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons -- the looks of course, but even the names are similar.

And a second incidental comment regarding Paris. France performed very badly in the war, what with embarrassing military capitulation, eager collaboration with the Germans, and native antisemitism. So (until France decided to side with the Soviet Union in the sixties) there was a deliberate policy of the Americans and French to rehabilitate the nation. And the centerpiece of that was the invention of Paris as a place for romance. The French never thought of it that way; its an American, mostly Hollywood invention. The French would have thought of Paris as a center of thought, art, industry, commerce, rather like Americans think of New York.

Since after the war (and mostly since) it has none of these things, it has reinvented itself as a theme park for lovers.

Gosh I remember seeing this when it was new and thinking how cool it was. It is amazing to me how quickly parts of our cinematic vocabulary become obsolete. I take that as a sign that we are evolving quickly. There are some elements of cool, and glossy noir here. But the thing that was novel at the time -- at least in Hollywwod -- was the experimental overlapping of memory image. 

There are several training events that are presented for one reason only: to set us up for the key scene.

The technique is simply a mini flashback where some situation in our hero's mind reminds him of something that happened before and we see it. We don't notice that it also contributes to the narrative flow, but it does of course. There are two such old events that we have recalled a few times: one is a drunk encounter on the floor of a reunion where two old buddies tie up for a crime. The other is when our guy is shot (and his wife stolen by the shooter). These have minor effect.

The payoff comes as something of the emotional climax. Our guy was apparently quite a ladies' man before the shooting, a sailor. He had a wife with whom he made love. Then she ran away with his betraying buddy and had sex with him. Then her sister as a favor to our guy has sex with this betrayer in order to entrap him. And finally, our guy has sex with the sister. It is after a (for the time) violent attack by the sister on him, where the nearly knocks him out in anger -- an anger that is aggregated form many sources.

The effect is that each of these sexual couplings is visually conflated: Our guy has sex with sister, rolls over and is having sex with wife, rolls over and it is wife and betrayer and so on. It is overly contrived after the first couple rollovers, because it is so unnatural. But in movie sex scenes, we routinely accept things that are contrived for the camera, so it actually does work. It is hardly worth sitting through a whole film, but it was cool forty years ago in the context of lingering shots of Marvin's pained face coupled with deliberately similar shots of an empty prison. (We are supposed to get the connection.)

The story parallels this as our guy goes from one gangster to another seeking satisfaction.

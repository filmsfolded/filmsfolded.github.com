Spoilers herein.

I'm convinced that comedians don't so much find what is funny, they invent it. Because it  comes from comedians, we laugh. Humor is not timeless but always mutating depending  on who the leaders are. In this way, we are simple recruits in the army of laughers. We  may complain, but there it is.

The Marx brothers are still funny, but for different reasons. It would be better to say that  they are funny again. When I first saw 'Stripes,' I thought it hilarious. Now it seems not  even campy.

Why is this? My own theory is that Bill Murray learned his craft just when overt irony was  fashionable. This was after Lenny Bruce could be pure by being profane and before we  got into nostalgic humor. So he developed his routines around the notions of not being  the character. This is his purest: a cool guy who is not cool, knows it and believes that  not cool IS cool. ItÂ‘s reverse Austin Powers, who we're supposed to laugh at. Here, we're  supposed to laugh at being made to laugh.

It was a gas then.

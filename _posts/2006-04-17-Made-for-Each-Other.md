Pity the poor screen writer. She has more than one nearly impossible maze to navigate.

She's got to create something that is clear enough for the audience's sensibilities, and in this genre that means there needs to be a moral to the thing and it needs to be plain. You also, incidentally have to have some dramatic arc, or so the conventional wisdom of the time would have.

You won't see this; at any rate, I hope you don't. So let me describe it.

Stewart is a lawyer, which in these sorts of films is a surrogate for a writer-performer. He is in the midst of a big case, Huggins versus Huggins. (Though it is a civil suit, the inference is that the plaintiffs are related.) In this case, his "performance" is superb, a hit.

Meanwhile, he is employed by a stodgy coot who is hard of hearing (get it?) and who doesn't appreciate our boy.

There's a device we are introduced to at the beginning: everything through writing -- the wife writes letters to her new husband even though he is next to her on the train. And the "theme" of the thing, the point is the he has to be clear and direct in expressing himself. He is to her. And he is on the stage of the courtroom, but not in larger life. By the end, he learns to and our couple presumably live happily ever after.

So one can imagine our screenwriter sitting down and worrying about clean writing. Precision. Its what she wants and what she writes about -- her on screen double (Lombard) providing the guidance.

But there has to be a dramatic trigger, and here it is the son who will die unless he gets some special serum, which can only be obtained by our mouse becoming a man. He does.

In amazingly self-referential fashion, this movie is a disaster, largely because it rambles. It spends all its wealth of our attention on insignificant elements: the honeymoon ship that has to be abandoned; the lone pilot who flies the serum through a dangerous storm to arrive at the last minute. These take up half the movie and should have been footnotes.

My own guess is that screenwriter had things in a clean perspective, but studio bosses blew those two elements (plus the comic mother-in-law and the wise black maid) up because they thought thats what was required. So the deaf boss wins in making the movie even though he is transformed within it.

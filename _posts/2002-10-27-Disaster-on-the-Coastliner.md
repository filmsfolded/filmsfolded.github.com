Spoilers herein.

This is surely one of the worst films I have seen of any type, made worse in my mind because of the wasted use of the FX budget.

But it has Yvette Mimieux. She's truly lovely and was talented, but lost her commitment years before. By this time, she was casually wading through TeeVee pap. Contrast her to Shatner who never, ever showed talent.

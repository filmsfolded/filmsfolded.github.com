Spoilers herein.

This is a film that is smart in that it knows itself and says so. It is a dumb film in that it knows what it has to do to be successful, and that's play to us bunnies -- not be the weak PG movie, but the R rated one.

Favreau the actor plays Ben Stiller less well than Stiller. Favreau the writer gets inspiration from and essentially steals from the 'talk-across-the-diner-table' genre. Superficially this is Tarantino but of course QT lifted from an old tradition as well. 

There IS some snappy dialog. There IS some self-reference. But (except possibly for the hockey game) it doesn't cut very deep when put next to, say, 'Kahuna' or 'Hurlyburly,' both of which mine the same human pathos.

The problem is that Favreau the writer is sitting down and thinking: I've got to seduce the audience. They're superficial, so the film has to be too. But at least I'll show my friends I'm not really Goofy by making the story about two guys talking about how superficial is the art of seduction. To make it obvious, everyone will be in the film business and have to do scummy jobs (like try to play Goofy).

These are better actors than the script. I have yet to see 'Made,' and I'm told that they solved some of the problems they had with this project. I was very impressed by Vaughn in the 'Psycho' metafilm. He understood what it was all about and was able to deliver both the 'straight' performance and the modern commentary on it. In fact his DVD comment on that comment was great, too.

There is much of Jane Eyre in this. A minor version had been made the previous year and flopped. What if you pulled out all the social commentary that Bronte used to shape her story and just built something on the ability of an innocent to make a good story? Then you can spindle the social observations afterward. I suspect that is something like what happened here.

The setup is simple. Orphan girl, newly a woman. Famed for storytelling in the orphanage. Selected to be an usher at a movie theater, she enters both the world of sexual advances and movies (analogously). Her strength and endearing manner give her the power to create a good story, which happens to be the one we see.

Yet another rather profound narrative experiment from the period when films were trying to discover what they were.

The girl is a brilliant redhead, though a viewer would not know except through fan magazines.

Hollow Man

Spoilers herein.

I particularly enjoy movies that are part of a series. That way, the context is even sharper  than the usual genre and societal factors that come into play. Context is what movies are  all about, and most particularly Schrader-written movies.

In this case we have three films ('Taxi,' this, 'Dead') about night prowlers in a corrupting  city, all written by  Schrader. Two have been directed by Scorsese and one by Schrader  himself. Scorsese is by far the more competent director, but I like Schrader's approach  better.

Scorsese selects actors that are full of energy and encouraged to radiate. They become  prime movers in the universe we see. The camera is attached to them, in 'Taxi Driver'  quite literally. As these guys move through the world, the energy of the world feeds  back. This fullness of energy and exchange drives Scorsese projects. Cage in 'Bring out  the Dead.'

That's despite the fact that what Schrader had in mind was something different. In every  one of his scripts he creates a world that moves on its own and pulls energy out of his  hapless hero (always a man, except when he tried it with his lover).

The correct type of actor for this is one that can create negative energy, someone who  visibly sucks life from outside forces. Scorsese cannot do this, but he came close with  Dafoe in 'Temptation.'

The final scenes in 'Temptation' are informed by Michelangelo's Pieta, an amazing statue  of the slain Christ in Mary's lap. She is alive - all the forms of her face and body are  constructed in such a way to contain her. Jesus on the other hand is more than simply  desiccated. Every form in his being comes not from what is contained within, but what  has been taken by the environment. He is defined by negative form. Not quite scallops  and scoops, but their more subtle and devilish cousins.

Dafoe pulled this off in spite of Scorsese's meddling. Schrader was there in Morroco and  saw this, so commandeered Dafoe for this project. Here, Dafoe sucks energy from what  surrounds him. His character doesn't understand why he is so jinxed, but he is. A  locomotive of removal, a hollow man hollowing out the space around him.

Sarandon is merely furniture, and does the job adequately. Her role is to give an excuse  for talk about karma and akashic records. Delany needs be no more than one of the  hapless lives caught in the vacuum.

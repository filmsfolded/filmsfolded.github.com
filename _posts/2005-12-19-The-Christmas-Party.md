The studios had to keep the screens filled of all the theaters they owned, so the studio- related short was a staple of sorts. It had to fill time, be mildly entertaining, and somehow showcase or advertise the studio.

The point was to remind the audience that MGM in this case had most of the stars, so coming to this particular theater every week was a good bet.

This was a seasonal edition and it is interesting in a way. It "folds" the notion of stars serving the audience with the same stars graciously serving unruly kids. The idea is clever, especially for 1931 when the folding notion was so young.

There's some mild entertainment value in seeing scenes that obviously were ad-libbed.

Sometimes the folding is just too contrived. It panders, insults with its obviousness. 

Here we have a professional man, who in a car accident loses the child he has but has never met. The story arranges for compound suffering.

Then we have the loss of a child of another in a similar car accident (with him as the driver this time), and his healing by meeting his counterpart, the child's mother.

The film follows the subgenre of 'special person' coming into your life and allowing you to see it in perspective. The folding mechanism is that we watch this special person in the being of the on screen watcher. As he is changed, we are as well, or so the theory goes.

The watcher is Rickman, doing well. The special person is Weaver, playing an autistic. She does less well, not following the advice in 'Tropic Thunder' of how to handle such roles.

Given the pedestrian form, the writing is pretty tight. The 'snowcake' of the title is very well conceived as a device and rolled out effectively.

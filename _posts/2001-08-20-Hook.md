Here is the second of Spielberg's three great disasters (with 1941 and AI).

His approach to film is heavily sentimental, highly refined. He sticks a coathanger through this narrow keyhole and sees what images he can snag.

Sometimes it connects, at least in enough spots in the film to keep us on the path to wistful hopefulness, to a world that works the way we wish it would, But I am increasingly convinced Spielberg's success has more to do with this core vision of the world, and some mastery at storyboarding, than with any innate understanding of the medium. 

And here is an example. Some rather good material in actors by his standards. His support team is at or above average for his productions: Stalwart producer Kennedy, the writer of Contact, production designers of Brazil and Private Ryan, Cinematographer from Casper.

He is no less restrained in Hook than say in Close Encounters. No less sentimental than in Schindler. No less artificial than in Jurassic. No less preachy than in ET.

Hook is Spielberg through and through, but it didn't stick because it was a smidgen over the line, hit the tipping point and turned us off by his pandering.

Spoilers herein.

The world of film is large enough to encompass many types of attraction. We might be attracted to a film because of cinematic excitement ('Jurassic Park'), or clever plot twists ('Sixth Sense') or an endearing actor/actress ('Runaway Bride') or notable performance ('Breaking the Waves'). But there is danger when the only reason for a film to exist is in that one attraction. Each of the examples cited is a waste of time as it relies solely on that one hook to charm dollars and attention from us.

Many films are a result of this kind of Hollywood engineering. Not only is it the case that everything else that makes for a good film is ignored in such projects, often the reverse is true; the other values are deliberately compromised in order to emphasize the one bankable element. So no Julia Roberts film can EVER be watchable because every useful cinematic device is hijacked so she can earn her twenty plus million through her smile. But these one-track films are easy to spot because they bludgeon us with that one trait.

In the case of 'Freeway' we have a bludgeon that is at least interesting to discuss. The dynamic here is the bald fact that films are about films, almost never life. That makes them self-reinforcing and over a short period genres emerge. All genre films rely on huge expectations we bring to them; in this way, they can sustain alternative worlds without having to create them from scratch. Genres are the key tool of Hollywood engineers, and one of their engineering techniques is the so-called 'genre-bender.'

When a clever genre-bending technique appears, they are quick to exploit it as an attractive feature. Often, such a thing comes from fresh kids who aren't already programmed by the institution and in such cases, Hollywood prefers to have the writer direct. After all, directing an ordinary film is simple with all the support one gets and it ensures that a genre-bound director-for-hire doesn't ruin the spirit of the thing. Example: 'Boondock Saints.' And this.

The genre-bending has to be obvious and revealed to us, so that we can marvel at how clever we as viewers are. The bludgeon here is especially thick; it pounds and pounds: Red Riding Hood. Superficial selfcritical sexploitation. A Tarantino-like self-aware, self-tweaking version of 'Kalifornia.' A supervillain (and justice system) done in by a white trash tart.

There's a clear line between films that are tools for life and those that are attractive junk food. This is junk, with many penalties for consumption.

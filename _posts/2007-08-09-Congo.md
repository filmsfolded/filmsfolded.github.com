I'm pretty sure we could have done without Michael Crichton in the world. 

And this particular movie? Well, I think it was bad even when it came out. Its a weird hodgepodge of genres, sort of science fiction of the adventure genre with an Indiana Jones tilt. (Actually more like "Mackenna's Gold.") Badly acted, even with the usually interesting Laura Linney. Sort of reminds of Julianne Moore in "Evolution."

Well, at least Crichton is a student of writing formulas. That means that once in a while he will use a formula that is interesting, and we have that here.

The standard form for something like this is to have the fold be in the remote businessman. While he and his employees watch, we watch and are drawn into the story by proxy. But look what Crichton has done. That rich guy can't watch because he needs the diamond. Instead, we watch through the eyes of an ape who is taught to speak. And the backward fold is that other mutant apes are the threat that makes this a movie.

The diamond mine is marked by a watching eye.

I've already given you all the value there is in this. But it is a valuable example of exploiting the theory for effect.

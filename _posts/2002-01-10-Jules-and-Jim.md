Spoilers herein.

I have had a lot of trouble with this film, and in fact seeing it recently has instigated a mini-crisis in my belief system, at least so far as film.

You see, I saw this when if first appeared in the US, as a young man filling his bag with mindexpanding experiences. I was impressed with this 'new wave' stuff, the placement of romanticism in life, and the realism in the filmmaking process: just the reverse of what Hollywood was doing. And in those days, Hollywood = establishment = repression and lies = racism and war. So by 'seeing French,' I was entering an international community of intellectuals, fighting the good fight by filling the ether with enlightenment.

It is a real shock today to see this and be reminded how daft was that notion. In particular, I'm stopped in my tracks at how weak are the ideas. It is not just French film -- I recently resaw 'Marienbad' and was similarly struck at how its value has compounded. No, it is THIS film. THESE notions.

Here's my shocker: I have long maintained that film is an evolving medium that is uniquely poised to reinvent how we think. A successful film to me is one that advances that evolution. I particularly like it when they do this is a self-aware, self-referential manner. But what about films that do just this, do become important in this way, but then become irrelevant? What about that?

On reflection, I must conclude that this film was just popular for cultural reasons (like 'Schindler'), not important (like 'Streetcar Named Desire'). An entire generation, in a sophomoric stupor, talked themselves into this fey romantic irony. Do we know better now, or have we just moved to another thin profundity? Which nervous infatuation, which lover?

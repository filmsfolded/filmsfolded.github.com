I recently saw a film by Erich von Stroheim. It was unremarkable. But associated with it in IMDb was a quote about how in Paris if you ever made a good film, you are celebrated forever. In Hollywood, the only thing that matters is your last film.

Doug Liman made what I consider a very good film, one that stood out in many ways. Novel, engaging, original. That film, "Go," brought me to many others by him, always with the French expectation that I would find the same artist, the soul with the light that never does.

But its been one ragged shadow after another. But at least some of them had enough to not make audiences run away.

The mistakes here are obvious. They paid attention to the many locations shots, done well enough to register. And they paid some reasonable attention to the special effects: the teleportation and fights. And then they thought that would be enough. 

They obviously missed on the ordinary values of acting, character and story. But you know, I would have easily forgiven that if they had been more integrated in their cinematic approach. This is just like the "Spiderman" movies. The character swoops. Its pretty much all he does that's interesting. The camera should swoop too. It didn't there.

About the only other energetic things a camera can do is shake, which we saw done well in "Transformers," and jump, which I expected to see here. Its as if it never occurred to them, even in the frenzied climax where it would have been almost accidental to do jumps. 

Nope. Plus we have to endure Samuel Jackson, one of the biggest, dumbest muggers around.

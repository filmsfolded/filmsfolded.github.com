A simple parody is played straight. It derives from, refers to a source, and caricatures it to the point of ridicule. A more elaborate type of parody isn't in itself funny, but after viewing it you retrospectively laugh at the original, though you might have taken that seriously originally. Political satire often takes this form. It is risky, because the ordinary joe doesn't quite understand retrospective humor. And they usually won't pay to see it.

So the Waylons came up with a new formula. They make films that have this ventriloquist humor in it, and add in another type of humor to distract you from what they are really doing. The apparent humor here is juvenile sex jokes. But since all sex jokes are class jokes, the real humor is class humor, goofing on the stupid. The neat trick is that making you laugh at the first, underscores the second. If you are laughing at the dick jokes, the laugh is on you.

So, the primary humor here is based on how stupid we are - how stupid the characters are (always choosing the path to death instead of the safe one even when marked by signs); and how stupid we are in being amused by such persiflage. Alone among directors, Waylon can get away with class humor (which is not racial humor) because he gets a free pass as a minority. And he paid his dues. Check out his other work. It is all based on making people laugh at how stupid we are. The dour Spike Lee should be taking lessons.

So what this crew does is drag out a bunch of fart and genital jokes. Unlike with Eddie Murphy, the point is not to seriously amuse, but to amuse by not amusing. The worse these jokes are, the more funny the referent, so long as we accept that someone (like Murphy) really does use this stuff, and relative knuckleheads really do laugh at it.

Think I'm making this up? Why would they end with the 'Usual Suspects?' Not because it is horror, nor because it was juvenile. No, because it was just this sort of sophisticated retrospective reinvention. What you learn at the end completely revises everything you have just accepted. So here we have the scary movie revealing itself not from a dummy (Doofey), but from a master storyteller forcing you to go back and reinvent your perspective on what you just saw. Ventriloquist humor. Clever, but risky, because you are taking money from the people you goof on. 

('The Matrix,' also cited here, also danced with this theme in an indirect way. But without the goof on the viewers.)

With work like this, Waylon will do more to raise the consciousness of a few than Malcolm X ever could.

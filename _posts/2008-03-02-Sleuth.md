The original was a theatrical conceit, a tight little knot tied between two characters writing a play for each other. Its much like "Deathtrap," which also had Caine, who starred in the original. There he was opposite Larry Olivier. Now Olivier is not a good screen actor, and he butchers Shakespeare, but the original "Sleuth" depended on the ability to step out of the cinematic frame and into a larger self-referential theatrical one. It worked there.

This works better, so very much better. Lumet and Mankiewicz are directors of the first order. But this material is a natural for a Pinter-Branaugh collaboration. Its because it is a play written competitively by the characters. And because though it starts in a way that is easy to follow, in the last ten minutes, it escalates to levels of ambiguity and ambition that enter the zone of dark logic both men prefer.

The first bits are pretty much from the original, excepting the amazing staging. This, we learn, is a house designed by the absent wife. It's full of anticipatory spaces, as if it were designed as a set. Panels reveal other spaces. The elevator is open so that we can see into it. The entire place is covered by cameras so we can see everything.

(These cameras by the way behave not as surveillance cameras, but cameras that have human curiosity.) 

Walls change color every few seconds based on lights that would be impossible in a real space, one with a ceiling.

So even in the beginning where the game is simple, she has agency. If you only know the original, you will believe that it is merely the two men at war, a war of writing each other into humiliating stories. The Pinter magic, of course is that he escapes this.

The game with Pinter has always been centered on noir, the mechanics of the viewer manipulating the action. In those last few minutes, he introduces the possibility -- only the possibility -- that an agent external to these has been manipulating them both. Its quite delicious.

But even without that, the amazing choices that Branaugh makes are exquisitely entertaining. His stagecraft amplifies the theatrical nature of the thing (sets, lights, static camera, formal poses) at the same time that he undermines it by appearing to have the acting be "natural" as if it appeared with no script. I'm not quite sure that Jude Law gets it though. He seems to be an ordinary actor here, not one that folds into the several layers Pinter inhabits. 

But Caine does get it. Its good to finally have him back after his virtual vacation of what, 30 years?

This is fantastic stuff if you like movies, and how they are put together.

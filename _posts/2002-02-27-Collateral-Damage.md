Spoilers herein.

I love it when I can see a film in a public theater when the audience is interestingly constituted. For instance, I saw one of the early Star Trek films in Hollywood at the first showing after the celebrity squat. Many people who worked on the film were in the audience and they were seeing it for the first time. I saw the Brady Bunch movie in the valley after school with an audience of mostly thirteen year old girls.

Film is both an intimate, visceral medium and a shared experience. Films are rooted in that audience and defines them in profound ways. Some films are more interesting if you watch the audience instead.

I saw this film on opening weekend in Berlin. I couldn't understand the language, but heck, this is an Arnie picture -- the whole plot was in the trailer anyway. With this audience, it didn't seem as stupid as an Arnie flick normally is, and I found that intriguing. In many parts of the world, they take these things a whole lot more literally than do Americans. I had a similar feel watching a Stallone picture in a small town in Brazil. They weren't laughing; it was serious business. But this was a sophisticated city, supposedly as steeped in irony as anywhere -- something to think about, maybe worry about. In Berlin, it seems, he actually is a hero rather than a joke like our other soap opera 'wrestlers.'

But the funny thing was the dubbing. Arnie did not dub his own voice, though he is far more fluent in German than English. My friend explained: he is in reality a bumpkin, what in the US would be a hillbilly. If he used his real voice, in his native tongue his native people would recognize him as a country dummy. This would do in the US, but not in Germany where he is taken more seriously. So he is given a strong, Prussian cadence.

It is as if we dubbed George W Bush to sound like John Kennedy or Harry Truman because we needed it to be so.

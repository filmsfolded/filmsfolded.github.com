My first reaction was the same as everyone's. A disappointment in the movie and one in myself for being so ordinary.

The film probably was pitched at having the creatures and combat of the franchise, plus all sorts of dramatic tension among the humans. And then they compromised and botched those tensions. So you end up with unfulfilling drama and unrewarding action. An ordinary mistake and an ordinary reaction. 

The only mildly interesting thing here is the slight modulation of race. The black guy isn't the first guy killed; the Hispanic guy is. That means the black guy can be second. The change is significant in how small it is. We have a real actor playing the reclusive survivor of several seasons. He is physically black but narratively raceless. Fishburn is often wrong, but here he is right -- the only element that doesn't get caught up in incidental stereotypes.

It is the girl that fascinates. She is played by an inadequate actress I think, but you can see what they were going for. There's no novelty in having a warrior woman who matches the men. Tough leather has been around for a while. But why make her a Jew? Why imply -- until the last moments -- that she has no sex? It is because someone -- Rodriguez? -- early in the script process was prepared to take some risks with the character. Watching the movie is a process of burrowing through the garbage they produced to find relics of what could have been. I think they started off with her being more combative about leading the team. With the right treatment, she could have saved this movie.

The business about roles and race is mirrored in the aliens' own racial system. I forget cosmologies, so it could be that this was mentioned in an earlier film. But I think not. I think this is new. It almost works.

Watching films and wondering about the experience is made that much richer by comparing the films and comparing the wonder.

It is a bit more fun when the films are similar, like sequels or remakes. I've recently watched the 2009 remake and liked it a lot. That is because the camera was given the energy, the hunger, the risky curiosity of the kids. The investment was made in the capture of the thing. So instead of watching some kids with juice, we became them.

This is an entirely different film, about as different as you can get. The camera and all the cinematic art is hidden. Your place in it is the same as if you were watching a documentary, like "Mad Hot Ballroom," which has some of the same components.

All of the investment here is in the kids, their characters. There are engaging songs, designed not to engage you in the song directly, but the characters you see associated with the songs. The actors have juice, unlike in the remake. These kids put everything on the line. They are not mature powerhouses, but there is an appeal to getting honesty instead of craft.

None of these kids had a meaningful career. But they did make something that matters, and once should be enough.

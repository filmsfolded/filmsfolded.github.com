After the huge success of the first film, a sequel was required. Too bad for us. The fiction of the possible dream-vision was jettisoned. This is real world stuff.

The emphasis shifts from the crazy visions of the crazy inventor to real complications of time folding, such as we can handle in a mainstream Zemeck. And it is pretty darn complicated. We now have parallel worlds, overlapping times, actors playing multiple characters, actors playing the same characters at different ages, characters changing the lines of themselves in earlier states, the time machine coming and going past itself in ways that only make sense if you are tied to the narrative this one way. 

We also have scenes and tropes from the first movie repeated in slightly different form. The way of tracking whether the future changes is by photos and newspapers that change as their past is manipulated. Oddly, there is a similar time-travelling document -- a pulp magazine of sports scores -- that does not change.

It is hardly enough to make the movie worthwhile.

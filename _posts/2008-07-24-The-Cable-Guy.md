Humor is a matter of taste, but when it is as dependent on timing and tone as this is, one at least has to admire it. 

You might consider this as rooted in a comic story of obsession. 

Or you could easily ignore that and get into the posturing of Carey. 

But what I see is an attempt at twisting noir: the idea that the viewer perturbs life, usually the life of a random innocent. Its a profound notion this noir idea that the watcher delivers the movie. Here the watcher is in the movie, delivering it via cable. He has the identity of past "movies."

Its amazingly clever.

I watched this because I recently saw Heath Ledger in Dark Night. As widely publicized, Ledger and Nolan drew heavily from "Clockwork Oragne." But Heath had a very hard time finding the voice. I believe this helped him. The similarities are striking.

Next up in this study; "Equus."

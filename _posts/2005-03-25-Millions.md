"Billy Elliot" is on my list of worst movies ever. Sure, I laughed and cried at all the right places. Sure, it was well enough produced, in fact the competence of the production was in knowing what works and what doesn't based on knowledge of movies past. So why didn't I like it? Because it was fake, because it took advantage of me like a selfish, scheming girlfriend. Because it addressed me on an automatic level; because it actually made my life worse rather than better because it reinforced many of my automatic responses without allowing me vision into myself.

"Millions" is worse. Its Irish kid is even cuter. Its competence is ever so much sharper, the edits are unusually harsh, but appropriately so, for instance. Its values are more heart- tugging: Jesus, selfishness, dead mothers and all. But its overall effect is ever so cheap and shallow, and on that basis I'll recommend you stay away.

But this does something that even "Billy" didn't do. New analysts in the business have promoted a theory that works and is now a part of engineered projects like this. There are two experiences to every film: the one you have when watching, and the one you remember. These need not have anything to do with each other, indeed, they often work against each other.

A coherent film takes you to another world and perhaps changes you. A memorable film is a collection of the movie equivalent of sound bites, strung together in as loose a way as we can tolerate. Politics, religion, relationships, all things have these two choices before them. Unless the sound bites are in themselves artistic, they demean what they refer to.

But we have those bites aplenty here. The cardboard boxes, the (incorrectly envisioned) cell phones, the copious mug shots. Think about whether they grew out of the story and characters, or out of a need to shoehorn in memorable visions in the same manner as the product placement here.

This could have been a great project: the structure is based on something that both works and rewards: the notion of an untrusted narrator. In this case, we see a movie that is from the warmest part of our hearts about a child's vision from the warmest part of his. By conflating the two, we become him. Its a great idea, especially with children-based movies, like "The Muppet Movie" and "Harriet the Spy." But you have to play fair by defining the layers well enough for us to read them. This may have started out well enough in this regard, and been compromised along the way for the memorable moments.

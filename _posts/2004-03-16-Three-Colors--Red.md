Spoilers herein.

In addition - or perhaps in spite of - what you have heard, this trilogy is organized  around the three main choices one can take in narrative stance. 'Blue' was about the  past, 'White' about the 'conditional' future(s) and this one about the present. Or rather  about a couple instances of the present that overlap: is their really only one judge, one  lost love, one dead battery, one hooked brother?

The folding of the present uses the folding mechanism of watching: us as watchers, Much  of the world watching Valentine through cameras, runways, TeeVee. The judge-with- qualms monitoring. And all of these folded against the others.

And on top of it, Kieslowski has assembled a design team that produces one of the  lushest visions on film, taking the folding metaphor into the framing, especially in the  various rooms.

If you know what he is attempting here: three essays on the role of the viewer in creating  the 'time' of the film world, it makes all three that much richer. But here we have his  most sublime success, a perfect synthesis that people can enjoy even if they know not  why. And that's the point, isn't it?

Oh, and each of the trilogy focuses on a sense: here, it is sound.

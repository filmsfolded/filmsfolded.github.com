There's treasure in the story of Elizabeth. Its part of our deep structure, if for no other reason than she was there when the language and the US was born. She had Harriot, Bacon, Raleigh, Shakespeare. She preserved the world from Christian religious extremism. The banking laws were established during this time that allowed a tiny island to become a world power. This is when the great repression of Ireland began.

There are few people so well suited for cinematic drama. If Shakespeare were writing today, she would be a first choice. I suppose that's why so many wannabees take her as the matter for their screenplays. So when you come to these, its a business of evaluating how badly they missed the target -- how bad an imitation do Shakespeare we get.

This one is pretty bad. Oh, its glorious. It has the common conflation of fate, love and politics that seems to be trendy these days.

It has fantastic costumes, and colorful but a bit clumsy attempts at Elizabethan backgrounds. These aren't quite accurate and seem excessively stagy, as do the castle interiors. 

It has a colorful actress shifting emotions and giving us the message: love, passion infuses all.

But it isn't true. She was just a selfish woman with the power to command and reward sexual favors. Love of the kind we celebrate in film had nothing to do with it. 

But that raises the question about why we like this portrayal, and the excellence with which is rolled out. I suppose each of us have to answer that for ourselves -- and I suppose most of us will conclude that it is because passion, love, sex in "ordinary life" (which politics usually represents in these projects) is what we desire with a similar passion.

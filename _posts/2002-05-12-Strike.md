Spoilers herein.

This film is striking. Novel, effective. But I think it only of historical interest. Here he works out certain experimental techniques:

--Choreographing the camera and lights. Framing and motifs.

--Juxtaposing images for tempral addition, what has come to be called montage.

--Conflating motion of the action with edited motion between shots.

One can appreciate his toolbox, but the project is slight. Only with his 'Ivan' films does he get down to the actual business of getting behind our eyes instead of dancing in front. Here, the abstract is just abstract -- later the abstraction reflects the purity of recognized life.

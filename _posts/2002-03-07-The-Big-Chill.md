Spoilers herein.

It is with some sadness that I see this film now. I was a child of the 60's, two years older than Kasdan, which of course places me where Kasdan remembers himself.

When this film came out, it was part of the great exhale from the Reagan era, and a fond remembrance of when people were just better. It was easy to be smug when subsequent generations' touchstone movies were things like Porky's and America Pie. 

This film was an affirmation that we were okay, and was immensely popular. Part of the charm was recognition that these were Real Actors up there. On seeing it now with some distance, it is really shocking how unjustified that smugness was. Oh, the acting is still credible, and the music still resonates. But the writing seems more like a report by Time or even People Magazine on the era, something that itself is directly parodied in the script.

In fact, the film in relationship to the real 60's has precisely the relationship to life parodied in the Sam Weber TeeVee show. We just needed some distance to see how contrived and simplified it all is, as if it were written by the Star Wars guy. But then, that's just what it was.

That sweet spot that this film hit almost twenty years ago has melted and the film has faded into the wan oblivion of the rest of Kasdan's output.

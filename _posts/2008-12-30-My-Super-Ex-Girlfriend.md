Before the mundane recent Will Smith superhero movie ended, it shifted into a whole new wonderful zone and became an amazing love story. The woman in that case was exactly right for the tone, attitude and appearance needed for the adventure. I was impressed, especially so that they would take the risk in the first half to be deliberately dull in order to surprise us. I think this can be done these days because we only remember how we felt at the end.

Before that, we had this similar experiment. It fails in profound ways, for all the reasons that the other succeeded. Uma Thurman has had some appeal in projects years ago, primarily based on her posture. So that's a failure, but I think there is something deeper. In the success, there was a dependency between the inevitable love and the superpower. One both created and confused the other. It wasn't made explicit and that's why it worked I think.

We have something almost the same here. But its made explicit, it isn't clear (and treated comically when it is) and has no real tension. The story is based on the bitchiness of Uma's character, not her powers, and not some mystical balance between love and power.

here's something interesting. Uma's pre-super persona is redhead and her superself is blind. The "good girlfriend" (who is much sexier) is blond in the "normal" state, then brilliant red as super.

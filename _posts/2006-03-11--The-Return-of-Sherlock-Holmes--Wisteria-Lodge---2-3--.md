By now you probably know that the Holmes series, like most of its ilk, has a production formula that changes everything each time excepting the main characters and few sets.

This is the worst effort of all the ones that feature Brett, and is oddly paired in the same DVD as the best.

Its not worth commenting on the story. The producers decided to not have any of these be mysteries in the writerly sense that you are given clues and weave wits with Holmes. Instead, they think you will be happy with a clever surprise at the end.

But still with those constraints, we can get a director and writer that tries to interpret the detection cinematically and succeed. Obviously the producers so specified because each episode tries a different trick. Some are apt, some not. Aptness aside, many fail.

The device here is mirrors. There must be a score of shots where the action is seen in a mirror, usually composed as a dynamic object in the frame. There are directors who know how to use this. Tarkovsky built an entire essay on it and the idea of inner rumination as reflected reality is in the first couple weeks of film school.

But this fails, alas. Its not used in any competent way, and we're not supposed to notice.

Spoilers herein.

What's interesting about this is Gwyneth. It is the only thing that's interesting, but it is. She's trying on acting styles. Here, she's quite different than in 'Shakespeare,' different than in 'Emma,' even than in 'Doors.'

This is the Emily Watson phase. Watch her act as if she was acting open. Watch her work her mouth like Emily's. Little eyebats.

She's turning into something to watch. Not for how well she fills characters, but in what actress's manner she does.

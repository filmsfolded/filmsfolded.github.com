I admit I am a movie obsessive. The things I obsess about have to do with the nature of the thing.

I'm astonished at the variety of modes we have for one person or a group to perform and communicate.

The most interesting movies have a couple layers, for instance here we have a presentation (a TeeVee show) about a presentation, Blaine's street act.

What's cool about this is that you have to satisfy two audiences, manipulate two sets of media constraints. Okay, that is interesting enough, but the whole thing is centered on one device: sleight of hand.

Now, the entertainment value if sleight of hand is the apparent candor, the openness of the performer. So not only do we have the normal constraints of the media, but we have to go so much further in the immediacy and honesty involved.

Does this succeed? Yeah, I guess it does.

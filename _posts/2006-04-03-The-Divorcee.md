Superficially, this is a junker. The story is simple and would coalesce with thousands of similar movie stories to give us our modern date movie: love, some crisis, realization and reunion.

Some commenters mention the "modern" themes as if infidelity and the wounded male weren't older than humans themselves. (I admit, every time the evocation of this hits home.) Others note that this is precode, by which they mean racy, but it isn't.

The whole thing is tepid except for one thing, the design of the world.

This is world of spinning pleasure which couples need to actively avoid to remain stable. It actually has little to with marriages, this stability, rather relationships of all kinds. The world of this movie dances and charms, it hypnotizes disguised as amusement. It ruins in the name of romance.

Its probably the way the real world was in a few big cities between the wars, the world I know best through Scott Fitzgerald and his Zelda. Its pretty amazing, this portrayal, more penetrating than usual because it inhabits every character.

What riches can be mined by making a story about a master storymaker! Here, the floating objects come from the soul of the writer's works having become disembodied from the fleshweaving passions that fueled it. Here, that soul is literally appropriated by a committee and managed to the detriment of the man and marriage that were the channel. It is a strong river to mine for drama, a river in the original flow from the artist, the secondary flow within the public that is taken from him (denoted by document signing!) and the tertiary flow in what comes to us.

I found the film a bit too predictable: we have an on screen surrogate observer who learns the lesson of holding onto his passion in spite of the attraction of the words-as-being. Though I admit that the key actors were effective and I wallowed as intended, the form of the film was as simple and formulaic as the appropriation of the works that it overtly criticized. So I left the movie strangely feeling dirty as if it had tricked me into being a thief and revealed me as such.

The music was too much of past Russian film epics for me. Costuming is ludicrous. 

But just to competently be caught in that river powered by love, made through words, remade as image and received again in passion -- that is worth it no matter the cost in compromise.

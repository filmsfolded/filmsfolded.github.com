Spoilers herein.

How strange to see this film again. I did so after seeing Paul Newman in 'Perdition,' and was reminded of how solidly in control he is.

But not in this mess.

Tennesse Williams was a brilliant writer, who used pain to evoke a mood and then create an unreal world. He steered clear of moralizing and happy endings, on both of which this film depends. He portrayed Brick as a raunchy, dumb bisexual jock now impotent with his sexy, trashy wife rather than the simple angry fellow who rejects sex that we have here. Gooper was fathered by an unknown. Big Momma was mentally ill, that sort of terminal repression you only found in the South. The plantation was run essentially on slave labor in a heartless manner. The play was gutted and Williams loudly objected.

Newman also disavowed it later in life after he learned how to really act. Elizabeth Taylor is a joke -- her readings are so stagy, none of the passion and confused sexual energy of the part conveys. At no moment do we feel that she would literally kill for a son, and perhaps has. (But Burl Ives is amazing, tromping all over the material he knew from the stage.)

To understand how great the failure, one has to consider Brando's 'Streetcar' of a few years earlier. True to the play, not only to the material itself, but the philosophy of conveying that material. Brando reinvented acting, period. That revolution hasn't caught this cast. The power isn't there at all.

In fact, this film is to 'Streetcar' as the prancing of the noneck monsters is to the Pollit family. Think of the leads if they were played by Sean Penn and Julianne Moore or Cate Blanchett.

In an amazing element of self-reference, Newman was already a serious drunk when this was made and remained so until his son died in the 80s. Then he developed the real power he has today.

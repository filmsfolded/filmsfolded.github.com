Spoilers herein.

Its a real experience for me when a film's being is inadvertently echoed in its story. That makes the film a good experience in some respect even though it stinks on all other grounds.

In this case, you have a lovely woman (Hemingway) who is brought to Brazil for the purposes of making pictures using the exotic locale. And that's what this is, even to the point of being funded by (the then thuggish military dictatorship) government of Brazil.

It all ends up (both the movie and the 'pictures' within the movie) as fishbait.

Along the way, there's one (and only one) glamour shot, and it is posed as if it were an advertising still.

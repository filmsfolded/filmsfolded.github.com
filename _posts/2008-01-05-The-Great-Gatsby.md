This is something of a disaster, presuming you use current values.

Those values include non-wooden acting. Redford is a good man, I believe, but a simple man who understands storytelling simply. So he comes at this with two burdens. One is that his acting palette is small; the other is that even that is misdirected because the story is just a bit beyond his reach.

Fitzgerald wrote his story in a time before American novels became intrinsically cinematic in both presentation and the assumption of noir dynamics. What he worked with was life as invested in the actions of individuals, the tension being between individual actions that were slight, fickle, frangible and those that settled into iron in the soul. These contrasted with the oppositely distributed surrounding institutions of society which keep the slightness of wealthy humans from killing them.

Its a rather wonderful construction: simple enough for schoolkids but complex and deep enough to matter. Its the sweet spot for books that want to last. But its peculiar enough that a filmmaker would have to understand it well to convey it. This filmmaker doesn't. Coppola, for all his other talents never did. Capote never could escape the world he built to live in, so his adaptation wouldn't have worked either.

But it would have been at least interesting, huh? Lois Chiles plays an observer other than the narrator/writer. She actually is hypnotizing in the role, what role they've allowed. Capote would have made her a lesbian with issues, a manipulator who played on the caprice of the weaker souls around her. That would have at least made this work.

I love movies like this, where the story and the form overlap.

This is a movie about a talentless girl from breadbasket America. Some "professionals" decide she has spunk and make a force fit with other, heavier talents. She does her best and some people like her, mostly her family and boyfriend. (Miraculously through this, we hear not her singing, but something processed from her singing.)

And the film itself is the same thing. Huff is a talentless girl from Texas (no less) who's been talked into performing. And she does it so good-naturedly that no one minds and some of us even like it. But she still gets no "scholarship," because most of us -- like the judges and the damaged dad in the story -- see the truth: she is not a winner.

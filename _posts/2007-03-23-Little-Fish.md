There are two national traditions of a sort that are driving excellence in film today. One focuses on the nature of the long form in terms of structure that connects emotionally and through folds intellectually as well. Its Spanish filmmakers, though distributed around the world.

So far as modern acting is concerned, it is the relatively small nation of Australia who so dominates it is a wonder. It must come down to a couple -- or even one -- influential teacher at the national acting school there, NIDA.

Here we have the latter without the former, such a shame. Oh, the filmmaker is intelligent enough, let's say of the Frears type and intensity. He's put together a sad tale of tentacles into a woman's soul, that once touched is forever vulnerable.

But its essentially actor-centric. The actors fill their spaces marvelously, and create a wonderful froth of interaction. But it is merely froth. Inlike the handles the actors give us, the filmmaker gives us none. There is no shape to this as a film, no engagement as a story apart from what the actors give: parts.

I saw this with "Bongwater," which was a minor success in that the film was broken in the same way the heroine was. That's true here as well, the difference being heroin instead of pot, and a much higher level of skill all around. Cate played much this same role in the recent "Notes on a Scandal."

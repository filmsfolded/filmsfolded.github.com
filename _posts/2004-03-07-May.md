Spoilers herein.

This is a fine little movie. Because it is what it shows.

Horror movies - more than any genre except date movies - are about other horror  movies. Rarely do they innovate, instead they sew together parts to sit with you a while.

The business about blind viewers and audience behind glass was banal, but completely  apt.

And usually the story is mostly irrelevant, the tone set by the director and/or actors. Here  is the actress, Angela Bettis. I have not seen her before and was really shocked at how  effectively she places herself between Carol Kane in 'Office Killer' and Lauren Ambrose in  the first half of 'Can't Hardly Wait' (the good half). I'll look for her in the future.

It has two games: the first is to spook us out with May. The second is to set up that last  shot; that was risky, but worked. I've noticed that many horror movies work toward the  last shot, and the clever ones add a new tone at that last minute - a tone we don't  expect that by itself is shocking.

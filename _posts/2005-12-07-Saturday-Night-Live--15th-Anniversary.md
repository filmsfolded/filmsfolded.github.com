One notion of humor in TeeVee is simply to exceed the limits. American TeeVee had such strict bounds (for a variety of uninteresting reasons) that this was easy. But the line keeps moving, so something that depends on this fades in a short time. 

Here is depressing proof. SNL during this period was considered cutting edge. Now watch this. It doesn't quite repeat the top jokes, rather references them.

One or two are still funny, the Eddie Murphy race jokes, but that is because America has actually moved backwards in race.

But the rest of it is shocking. So unfunny it makes you wonder.

You are what you laugh at. So selecting humor out of which to build yourself is as important as negotiating any art.

Stay away from humor that depends on stepping slightly over the edge determined by TeeVee market forces. And this type in particular.

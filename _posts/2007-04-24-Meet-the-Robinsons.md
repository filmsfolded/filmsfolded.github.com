What do you want from a movie? Or better, of the various types of movies you encounter, what are the types of things that give your soul value that you recognize?

I think the more time I spend with film the more I value things that can only be found in film, that are extreme in this quality and that touch reality with the most economical and effective shorthand. Abstraction and the contrast between intense and subtle, indirect.

Disney isn't usually the place I go for these experiences, at least not recently. They used to be experts at manipulating the code, the abstractions that touch little triggers in our minds that spin stories. That means the storyteller doesn't have to weave much of the story directly, rather play the storytellying instrument in our minds as an organ would be played. She works the machine. 

Animation (and porn) seems to be where these triggers are purest. Romantic comedies which are a blend of the two.

Here's why I liked this and why I recommend it to you.

The story is clumsy in the beginning. I think we can expect this. Kids are patient for a while and there was a deliberate decision to set up some lengthy story lines at the beginning so that we can have an amazingly economical wrapup at the end. What we remember is the end of course, so this is a good tradeoff. And the story is corny as can be. That's what you get when you abstract into this space. Audiences yearn for these stories and though I do not, they don't bother me. Much. 

You can see the influence of Lassiter (from Pixar). Supposedly the whole thing was redone after he saw the nearly finished project. In a way, its better storywise than what does from scratch. Its darker. The evil here has a lower bottom than you'll find in Pixar projects. Their evil is a matter of music and escape. The evil here is palpable, a mix of human evil (eventually reversed) and some supernatural evil that is much deeper. It derives from and plays with noir.

Its all abstract. The core of the story is "writing" the future: "moving forward," used as a catchphrase as well as a cinematic philosophy.

So yes, even on the story end, I would be sending you to this. But mix that with the artwork....

What I saw was the three D version. Now you should know that once I traveled across the country (talking US here) to see the only copy, recently restored of the three D "Dial M for Murder." That technology required two projectors, meticulously reconstructed and synchronized. And it required finding and restoring two independent copies of the film, one for the left eye and the other for the right. It was an amazing experience, seeing how Hitchcock, who invented the curious camera, used on-screen space.

So I'm a sucker for three D films, except for the so far silly things at Imax. These guys got it right. Its great, what they do. There's some self-aware stuff there just to show you they know you are there and aware of the effect. It increases the noir reality. But mostly, the three D is used subtly, in the service of the narrative. Its rarely done, you know and I actually recognized some clear copies of effects from that old Hitchcock film. 

See this, its very good.

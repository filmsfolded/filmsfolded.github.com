I am a Jess Franco fan. I like the way his intuitions work. He just starts: the story is made up as he goes which imparts a sort of random cosmology behind what we see. But the thing that makes it work for me are his cinematic intuitions. There isn't any artifice or guile, no film school magic. He just takes the camera where he thinks his eye would go before it occurs to the narrative self go there.

So even though the stories are cheap, and the images often pornographic, it has a cinematic integrity to it that cannot be denied.

But not so here, in his most "professional" movie. Oh, the story is random enough, and has his trademarks: minds controlling other minds, performances within the film, adoption of older film references, movement in life as movement through sex. But the camera is controlled by someone without the vision he is known for.

And the actress, though duly redheaded, is two hard decades too old, and twelve disappointments too severe.

You should pass on this one.

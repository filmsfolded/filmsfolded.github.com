If you have a source of old movies, often the tides of life determine which you pick to watch. Today a famous public preacher died. For those not in the US, he was one of the first wave of TeeVee preachers. This film was made before his rise, but seems resonant. 

It was controversial in its time, not because it showed fundamentalist preachers as flawed and confused, even opportunistic. In fact, it's rather soft and forgiving in that measure and to my mind is sympathetic to those who dedicate their lives to saving souls. "Leap of Faith" pointed its dagger toward relatively vile opportunists, but not here. The controversial element in this is different and targets the surrounding community. Leaders of a large city wanted the revival to come to town because it would be good for business, and not just the business of funding the churches. That element casts this in a very dark and cynical world, where the preachers are hapless but willing tools of forces they've erased from their own story.

That unnamed contemporary preacher famously strategized in a meeting of his peers to seize the issue of abortion as a Christian issue above all others as a tactical move to polarize the nation, attract folks to fundamentalism and turn the church into a political movement. He succeeded, primarily because the "movement" was endorsed by businesses. Fundamentalist churches in the US today support tax cuts and the business community in return supports antigay, antiabortion efforts. I'm not making this up. Its what was so disturbing about this film in its time, but apparently not now.

Vehicles like this are a blessing for actors, even the untalented ones we have here. Its a performance about performance. The folding is explicit because you can spend huge amounts of time showing the audience and talking about what reaches them, as the film does the same to reach us. Its also possible for the actors to display traits that would be repellent, outlandish, unbelievable of people in any other trade or calling.

Cinematically, the interesting thing about this is the score. You can feel the lucre in it, sliding in the background, a lubrication of unseen evil against which the simple hymns are faint armor.

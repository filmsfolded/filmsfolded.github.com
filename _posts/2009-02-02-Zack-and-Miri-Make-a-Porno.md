Another movie mashup. 

One component is an ordinary date movie. You now the formula: guy wins girl; guy loses girl (because of some error); guy gets girl back in some public way. The only difference here is that the public way is them having sex in front of a camera. This is related to the other component which is supposed to distract and amuse us: all the supposedly funny, PG sex jokes.

Well, Kevin Smith just is not a smart guy, nor does he have creative instincts. The girl is quite pretty as required, and the guys is a doofus as preferred and there are two worthy jokes, but this is just. dumb. stuff. The only redeeming value is that it earns a listing of Tedg's movies within movies where the inner movie bleeds into its container.

Spoilers herein.

I revisit certain movies because though poor films, they have some extraordinary element. This has two, folded into one.

The most obvious is Jack. This is how young Nicholson acts when he is unconstrained. More precisely, this is the fullness of his acting style when he has it on his own terms. Jack's talent is that he understands the envelope of stage self, and how to place his presence in relationship to that shell. Sometimes he is inside, doing his 'internal' acting bit, similar to what most others do. But once in a while, he shifts to an external presence where his being is mostly outside his skin. We usually notice this when he is energetic or right after he has performed one of his violent shifts between inside and out. 

The only other actor I know who does this is Toshiro Mifune, someone known for the agility of this move, but he always signals the switch. Jack doesn't; in fact he more often sneaks into this external mode after convincing us that such shifts are always violent. The result is extraordinarily offputting and effective because we can never be sure who is watching who.

The master of this (performance-perspective) shifting trick is Chopin, who is the real star of this project. Chopin developed this notion of imagination-then-performance mapped to and inside-versus-outside the vehicle. In Chopin's case, it is a matter of creating a supposed focus in the tune, how it begins a direction and then unexpectedly doubles back, or comments on itself, or goes in a completely unexpected apparently unrelated direction - all this much like Garrison Keillor's storytelling. That's the disguise, because while you are paying attention to that, he has designed the music in such a way that the performer (if so skilled) can subtly shift outside the music by a technique of rubato, which is a parallel thread of moving 'in' and 'out' of the being of the piece.

Strictly speaking, rubato is a matter of moving slightly before and after the beat independent of the phrasing. Its a metaphysical contact with the listener that can be life-altering, especially if the same performer has diverted your attention elsewhere. Rubinstein was this sort of master performer of Chopin. The central element of this story is a Chopin piece played by 'Bobby!' Ostensibly he is playing the 'easiest' one he knows as if he were eight. The listener is impressed with the 'feeling' that Bobby claims isn't there. (Bergman's later 'Autumn Sonota' does the reverse, also with Chopin.)

It is a remarkable construction to so fold the story. It is about the dual modes of Chopin, presented by Jack using those two modes as precisely as performing as Playing a role can map to playing a piece. Even the bit about the chicken sandwich is about this.

To see how this can be exploited by a director who actually understands the phenomenon, watch what Sean Penn does with Jack in 'The Pledge.'

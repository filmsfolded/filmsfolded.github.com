I am finding these Cadfael episodes formulaic, predictable and uninteresting.

This one has a feature that is pleasantly distracting. The Princess, over whom two men fight, is played by Tara Fitzgerald. She's the sort of actress who can do well enough when all she has to do is act pretty and vulnerable -- usually (but not here) exposing her breasts along the way in a practiced innocence. 

She never was able to develop into someone that mattered. But here she is at her apex, her bearing absolutely perfect for the art direction here -- particularly the understated makeup. That apex, that pure archetype, is of a healthy, but demur, desirable but either dedicated or confused why not, unvoluptuously inviting, tentatively poised.

Spoilers herein.

As with Gilliam, Tim Burton isn't a real filmmaker, rather a production designer with a quirky taste. He creates a feel and shoves in the usual elements of characters and story and such. But the idea is that the 'feel' of the thing will be enough to sell tickets. That quirkiness worked for me with 'Ed Wood' which was essentially about the same thing (and had a particularly reflexive actor). But generally, his projects fail.

The idea here is to wrap it in immense publicity, nostalgic memory and some (then) bankable stars. But if you look at this now, you'll see bankrupt production design. Its not cleverly quirky. Just bad.

No matter in the long run. Burton knew he screwed up. He got it right the next time. Very right.

Spoilers herein.

Fenimore Cooper was another in a prominent line of 'European' authors who invented the modern Indian. In this model, the negatives of man were assigned to the white man, and the positives to an artificially ennobled Indian. Americans take this myth very seriously today from the Boy Scouts to environmentalism. And in a sad irony, Native Americans themselves suffer from this fantastic aggrandizement. It is how they see themselves. In my locality, the Native Americans define themselves exclusively through such stories.

Cooper's book was poorly structured and written, and survives only because the basic matter -- attractive passion, keening nobility, intrinsic evil -- is so hungrily consumed. We now have a film of this book, and it suffers from the same problems. Even discussing it is without interest. Even Day Lewis' famed intensity is converted into staged traits, patently artificial.

But in many other movies, I am content to just enter this mythical world of simple people and clear conflict and just enjoy myself. After all, we have the setting in the oldest mountains on the planet which by themselves amaze. We have some history that is more honest, complex and interesting than say that of 'The Patriot.'

What puts me off on this, at almost every instant of watching, is Mann's composition. The camera is our eye, but the director determines our philosophy of the world by defining how that eye works. One philosophy is to cast that eye in such a way that it appears to be discovering reality. That's how we use our 'real' eyes.

Another approach is to see the frame as a stage, and reshape the world so that it all appears therein. The way these poles are mixed is what makes people like dePalma, Tarkovsky and Kubrick worth the time. Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' was self-referential in this respect: the very geometry of the world was created by the camera.

But Mann is a mere stager. He sets up his camera, defines a boundary and then fills it. His camera doesn't move, explore, discover. The world is created for us. So every shot is artificially filled. No space is empty. This is not like the way Kurosawa fills the frame: we get the impression that Kurosawa's world is so rich that wherever we look, we see many layers. Not so with Mann: we get the impression that he has collected things from all around us and rearranged them in front of us, emptying what is outside our field of vision. Everything we see down to the last detail is false.

Once this is pointed out, every shot offends. The direction of the actors follows this: no motion is real -- every movement or affect is artificial. Every motive, plot development, point of action is cartoonish rather than a powerful abstraction (as in, say 'Moby Dick,' 'Huck Finn,' or 'Treasure Island').

The French won.

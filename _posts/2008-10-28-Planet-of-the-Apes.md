There are, I think, several genres hiding under the title of science fiction. The basic technique is to take us out of the world in which we live, but the intent of the author determines. Why. I like Phil Dick's intent, which is first to fold and twist the very fabric of those worlds well before he gets to moralizing, even when he thinks that is the primary thing he is doing.

But others take the science fiction route merely to focus on a specific foible. I find these incredibly tiring because usually the pattern is that of Jonathon Swift, which is make the point bold, clear and simple. But in his case, the idea was to challenge in such a way that well after the story ends, you start to weave your own, new stories because the root of what you previously had was destroyed.

This is the "Star Trek" tradition. Boring.

In this case, they added two extra attractions: monkey suits that for the time were pretty impressive and that Rod Serling type twist at the end, which is a bit ruined because we guess it long before.

So, I will report that in my estimation, this is not worth watching. Charlton Heston is something of a blot in film history, and the point of this -- though laudable -- is as blunt and useless as he is.

Now, the inevitable game: comparison with the Burton remake, which is generally panned. Burton isn't interest in morals; he does not believe in them. He doesn't intend to deliver a useful story at all, rather a mood, a world. All of his movies are science fiction movies in this respect. I saw this with "Sweeny Todd," to help me with the comparison. I think I value Burton's attempt more, because he at least allowed us to get past the costumes and believe. Its not much, but it doesn't hurt. This one does.

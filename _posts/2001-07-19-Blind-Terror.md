Spoilers herein.

I think this was a made for TeeVee production that somehow was made financially attractive to Blockbuster to stock. It is the old Diabolique play, arranged by the greedy husband. You can see it a mile away. What attracted me was the name of Ms Kinski -- just as it was supposed to.

Here is very clear proof that at least some great beauty and effectiveness in acting comes not from the actor. In Polanski's hands (literally we understand), she was hypnotizing. Here, she is talentless and incidentally unlovely.

You can have some fun with this film, though. It is so formulaic and predictable, it is so composed of prefabbed parts, that you can readily imagine how you could improve it. How you could increase the ambiguities of perception; how that could reflect on the multiple red herrings (here never red enough). I couldn't help comparing this to 'Fifth Floor,' which had similar production values. It wasn't great, but it had a real actress at risk, and some rather more competent pasting together of found parts.

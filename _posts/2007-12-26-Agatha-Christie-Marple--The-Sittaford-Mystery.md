The internet has greatly enhanced my movie experience, because I can get a consensus about what people think about something. Its an annotative hoot sometimes.

The general report here is that this is a bad movie. Its bad you see, because it changes the story around from the book. Therefore it "isn't Christie."

Its funny. What I saw was profoundly along the lines of Christie. The things I liked and didn't were precisely the things I like and dislike about her books. I'll recommend you stay away from this, but its because the weaknesses of Christie outweigh her strengths here.

Her strengths are in how she plays with the mystery formula. Things are never as they seem. Of course in mystery, that's the whole point, but the surprises are -- until her -- well within the delimited area of the story. What she did was push those limits away. Each time it was a different puncture in the fence, and to make it dramatic, she would conform more rigidly to other elements of the convention. 

Here, the murderer is more than just a surprise, its a surprise outside of the genre. She didn't always "play fare" according to the Sayers Rules, where the reader could have figured things out based on clues. Its against her that she would go for the thrilling surprise instead of the complex engagement, the game.

The way that the adapter has handled this is exceptionally well, I think. To move from one medium to the other and preserve the original, you really must change the original. They've done that so that story does work. Except for the role that Marple plays. 

Her stories depend on the fact that she is obnoxious, unlikeable, but with deep intuition. She's no Poirot, who works on logic. She uses induction rather than deduction and her poking of things is required. Here she is merely a detective, remote and not poking her nose in.

Another one thing about Christie that annoys me is that she feels the need to amuse but doesn't have the literary skills for it. So you'll find her setups very choppy in tone and sequencing. That also is captured here in an anachronistic editing style and score. Its directly borrowed from the first Batman movie. Its apt for Christie, and makes this all but unwatchable.

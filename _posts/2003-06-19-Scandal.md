Spoilers herein.

Yet another in a long line of films that center on prostitutes as performers and vice  versa. Naturally, we don't notice -- its part of the bargain. Add in the standard svengali,  the tempter, the devil, the Enry Iggins.

What distinguishes this one is supposedly more sexual frankness (but very little actually)  and the fact that the events really happened more or less.

It also features Joanna Whalley, who in other projects has had allure. But here, both she  and Fonda play women much younger than they are with more febrile pulchritude than  they can muster. Men mutter through their lives and legs orchestrated by Hurt's man  who also can't master his character. Dafoe was able to handle this role much better in  "Auto Focus." Nichole Kidman made her life in acting succeeding in the whore- performer's role in precisely the areas that Whalley fails.

The business on the other side -- the story of the man sucked into casual pleasure and  then being destroyed by a society based on the fiction of class -- isn't particularly  explored here. So we can't fault the lack of clarity and energy.

Whalley's charm as an actress is tied to red hair and how she uses it. For reasons of  historical accuracy, we start out blond and then go red which during the course of the  film gets browner and browner. This deprives her of her most significant tool.

Spoilers herein.

What can one say? Once again we have a film that in form goes against what it preaches:  the moral of the story is that tribal groups should stop their mindless dehumanization  of the "other." But it is done in a way that dehumanizes the South, still very much (at  that time) lost in post-Civil War depression. Oh well, just ignore that common enough  irony.

We do have a hilarious train ride, quite probably the model for much that followed. And  we have the amazing waterfall stunt. There is a dummy involved in the catch, but  otherwise these were the real stars involved. That knowledge amazes me. For me,  exciting film is about risk and sometimes physical risk will suffice, as with Herzog. But  this is amazing stuff.

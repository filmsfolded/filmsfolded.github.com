Spoilers herein

Woody is a journalist, recording IN film what he learns ABOUT film in his noodling  around. The style is conversational. 

This time he walks through the German mind. We have five or six main notions of film:  this one is rooted in the notion of the power of illusion to raise dark forces that  otherwise don't exist. Along the way, he notes that Nazism is to some degree a result of  these forces of film.

His attentions are divided in three parts: (1) the metanarrative about the German model  of film, spoofing that model all the way; (2) a satire on how he thinks that magic disturbs  our dreams and settles in our illusions about one another. The "factions," the "lists," the  $700 fee and Cusak's commentary all come from this; and (3) the requisite jokes almost  all involving Allen. To my mind, all of these fall flat, especially the bit about the bride left  at the altar. But I suppose he didn't have much to work with.

His lighting isn't up to what he attempts here, it is less stark than the originals. He really  needed Sacha Vierny. But his camera motion is great, because it goes beyond the  originals so  far we cannot escape the joke. This is minor Allen, working his way from the relatively  simple mastery of narrative style in "Annie Hall" to the more complex control of the  medium itself in "Sweet and Lowdown."

Along the way here, we encounter a few actors, all except Cusak wasted. Jodie Foster is  expected to grin and little else. Wallace Shawn, one of our greats when it comes to this  sort of irony, has a brief role that could be seen as an homage: Shawn gets the  promotion from the voyeur.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3, Has some interesting elements.

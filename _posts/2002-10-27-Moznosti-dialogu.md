Spoilers herein.

Svankmejer's work is a rather brutal battle between his stupid ideas about society and his incredibly rich visual imagination. Here that battle is its most obvious. The 'moral' is childish. The visuals are terrific. If you can stand the former, the latter is quite worth your time.

You will almost certainly not enjoy this. Its because it depends on conventions that have since been made obsolete. 

And it was roughly remade with vastly more complexity and depth by Kubrick.

But in its day, this was pretty spooky stuff. Although it is in black and white, you would have known the unstable governess was a redhead -- here with impractically flowing hair. You would have inserted that then simple stereotype into some cinematography that seems tame today, but comparatively, it exploits the space and hidden spaces therein.

But the essence of the thing was cerebral, as with the novel on which it is based. It is an adventure in the possibility of the untrusted narrator. The clever thing is that its not even clear just what that means. Superficially, it about a woman caught in a noir situation with ghosts and possessed children. One level removed, it is a two-braid: either that is true or she is imagining this and driving the children mad. 

But there is a sort of genius here that blurs all the possibilities in between. Both in some way. Even that there are demons of some sort that from the noir place of simple cinematic play have decided to seed suspicions of all possibilities, none of them true. I like this the most. It is something Henry would have admired though he hardly attempted it himself. But that was before noir was invented, this notion that the viewers are the ghosts, pulling lives to and fro.

Best see this, then "The Shining," to see how the notion of noir manipulation, and embodiment in space were taken to still unappreciated perfection. Or even "The Others" which is the complement.

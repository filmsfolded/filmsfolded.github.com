Do not watch this with anyone you care about. Some movies are good. Some are bad, but among them you can often weave an interesting overlay if you are with someone who can help.

But the thing has to give some basic material to work with. Cheap production and bad acting can easily be overcome, but a weak world is insurmountable. Usually, these things inherit a world from noir. That's a world rich in capricious ironies that the slightest nod can activate.

This is advertised as noir, and it is as far from that as it can get. With noir, this happen to people as if the gods were playing games and arranging odd circumstances. In this story, a few people simply make mistakes that lead to their downfall.

There's some promise in the setup: a floosie pretends to be a man's wife (in order to get a cheap ticket) and ends up as his wife. In between, she was a gangster's whore. The new husband is one of those pseudo-cops the movies invented in the form of "insurance investigators," and he wants to treat his (now reformed) wife to riches. So he teams with the gangster.

That's a pretty strong setup, including our hubby as part of the investigative team. Butthis description is twice as interesting as the movie.

Ted's Evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can probably find something better to with this part of your life.

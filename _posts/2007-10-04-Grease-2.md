I guess its worth mentioning that among the ideas borrowed from other high school oriented musicals is the notion of the kids giving a talent show, where the key song of the girl's love is performed -- and wins. 

Before I die, I may teach some film classes. One exercise would be for us to take some stock Mac software and with that alone take some horrid movie like this and fix it. Only a few are likely candidates. This is because the editing and music is so very bad that if the thing was edited expertly, with energy, and the songs were completely redone, it could work.

The editing first. Why this is such a good case is that the story never matters much in things like this if it has other charms. So knocking as much as a third or even a half out of it would be okay. The actors are completely without interest, which could be a plus: we can just make them all part of the background blizzard. You couldn't just pick among the shots, you'd have to zoom, crop and pan among what you had. You'd probably have to mix some sequences and present some others as flashbacks, forwards or sides. Maybe you could mix in some footage from other films -- or even new custom footage -- just as rhythmic filler. 

You'd have to noodle with the color. Its nothing here, nothing at all. 

Once one team of students built a cinematic pulse with enough long form arcs to matter, and maybe even some new dialog, they'd pass it to the sound team. I imagine all sorts of solutions here with woven genres that continue from beginning to end, to a simple redoing of the existing songs but competently and engagingly. To a sonic "What's New, Pussycat?"

I'll bet we'd get at least ten movies better than this, and one or two that would be worth watching.

I guess we should mention one man in connection with this. Lives do get judged, especially public lives. And most especially lives that carry artistic responsibility. So I don't in the least mind trashing one of the most damaging men in film and music, Robert Stigwood. I think its possible to be vulgar, tasteless and exploitative in the business and still have a justified life. I celebrate some in these comments. Its possible to make a simple movie designed to sell records -- where the big money was in those days. I liked "Flashdance," even on a recent viewing.

But when contempt for the audience, lack of art, plain inability to live and rough handling of hired talent combine, its worth actively condemning, in the hopes that it may deter future manhandlers of our most precious gift: imagination in love. Phhht to you Mr Stigwood.

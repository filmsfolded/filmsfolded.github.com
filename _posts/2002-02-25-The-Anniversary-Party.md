Spoilers herein.

Another film about film. Actors playing actors. It is worth watching if you have followed the careers of these two. Because they are earnest but not particularly intelligent, what we have are notions from the better projects they've been involved in.

Ms. Leigh has been in some important ones: strong directors with vision: the Coens, Altman, Cronenberg. A dogma film. She's got some interesting experience, and brings it all to bear here, but not always in the most apt fashion.

Cumming has a more narrow career -- playing the deranged, rather an easier thing. And he has less scope than Jennifer. But rather than run from it, he uses it. If you've been through his 'Titus,' you'll appreciate his references better.

This is an actors' project. So other than the writers' influence, the only matter of interest is how rich they are. The Kline family so towers over the others it is remarkable. The whole family. Even Phoebe transfixes, relying on his steady influence.

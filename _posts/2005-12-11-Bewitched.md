Folded narrative is all the rage among Hollywood writers now. And the Ephrons are hip, so they go along and here we have a simply folded story.

Simple folding, the kind anyone can do, is based on the simple device of a show within the show, and then some simple tricks to blend the audience of the movie with the audience within the movie.

It is a tried and true method -- duly tested and measured -- that gets people to "relate" to what they see. Most writers believe it has something to do with the audience subtly placing themselves in the world of the movie.

So.

If you are going to remake a TeeVee show, you make the story about a remake of that show. Simple. 

The folds are in the concept, plus several items that stitch the folds together. For instance: The actress that plays the witch *is* a witch with the same motives as the character; A character from the old show literally shows up in the new; Two of the modern Samantha's tricks involve "rewinding the tape" as if to underscore that she is both on the tape and controls it from the outside; The witch's modern father appears to her on TeeVee (as well as other places).

Nicole is known in Hollywood as someone interested in folded acting. She isn't particularly good at it, so like Nic Cage, she seeks out folded roles and them performs straight. But give her credit for intelligence.

Spoilers herein.

These are three very good actresses, each of whom have been spectacular elsewhere. For  women like this, you have to write to their skills, understanding that one wears her  character on the outside, one generates hers internally and the other just pretends. They  got the characters precisely wrong for the acting styles. So they come across as  characters worth divorcing -- don't think that was intended.

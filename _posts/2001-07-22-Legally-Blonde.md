Spoilers herein.

Well, yet another film that preaches against stereotypes and then shamelessly exploits them. There is only one laugh here: masturbation as reckless abandonment. Still funny.

Cat's eye comments follow:

This film is about a dog's quest for recognition. This dog, a peewee, is disgustingly stereotyped by the heroine -- who in mirrored fashion is also stereotyped -- which makes the offense deeper. A more clever film, like 'Scary Movie' might find humor in this, but not here. 

The story is that dogs run Harvard Law School, and they conspire to plant hapless humans in compromising situations for their own amusement. One such is a senior female professor who struggles with the dim bulbs society designates as law students. She adopts missy Elle behind the scenes, thinking she is pulling the strings. There's a sort of stacking: Elle thinks she is mistress of her destiny, the professor thinks not but she is ignorant of the canine gods.

Some minor sexual and courtroom dramas provide barking amusement. If you are a dog, you'll find this hilarious.

Spoilers herein.

I resaw this film recently, ahead of schedule. I'm being rather methodical in walking through films for study and comment and had TLKG on two lists:

--the 'big mistakes of filmmakers because they star the women they sleep with' list. Turns out that this is a long and fascinating collection (Mamet, De Palma, Welles, Besson...). There are some interesting things to say in this regard, but I'll save them for "Cutthroat" when I get to it.

and

--the sexy actresses, forty and over list (though she was 39 when this was released).

But I got to it early because of some professional work related to why so many Arabs believe that the CIA or Mossad were behind the 9-11 World Trade Center bombing. American children can readily sort out fantasy from reality it seems, but much of the world cannot -- and this film features the now obscene notion of killing 4,000 innocents and framing Arab militants to get increased funding for intelligence operations.

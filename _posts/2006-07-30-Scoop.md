Woody is such an accomplished filmmaker, with such a stable production crew that he can toss off a movie, essentially an appreciative valentine to a young woman -- he can do this quickly and still imbue it with more grace than most.

In this project, the basic cinematic values are merely satisfactory. I assume he just lets the crew take the most economical approach to capturing a scene. The blocking and coverage is predictable. The use of London has less texture than his treatments of Manhattan.

The story is where the magic is. Sure, he has a few good lines, funny ones. And sure, the two lovers are appealing enough. But take a look at the very idea of the thing. It springs from the idea of a 30's newspaper movie and their strong woman reporters. Several are mentioned.

But our girl is intended to be less, deliberately less by reference. Its rather amazing how Woody has started with the character and created a whole pretend world whose primary gravity is to place her vulnerable sexuality at the center. He reminds us by having a preface where she sleeps with an older man, a filmmaker she has encountered.

Against this newspaper device, he layers some others associated with writing on reality, apparently pulled from his mind arbitrarily. A stage magician whose magic works in an unexpected way. The mechanics of death that is temporarily defeated by the desire to tell a story. The device of the tarot cards, and the musical instruments in a vault rather than being played.

This IS minor Woody. He clearly has movies he works on and deepen beyond what we see, and other movies which are a sort of celebration of the immediate imagination.

Still, worth watching. And Ms Scarlett is fetching in just the space he made for her.

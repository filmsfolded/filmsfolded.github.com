Spoilers herein.

Some genres are extremely rigid, that rigidity being their very reason to exist. The main branch that concerns us here is the mystery. That's where the viewer/reader and the narrator/writer are made equal and are pitted against each other. It is a mental contest to see who clarifies the story first, and is a contest with very specific rules.

Film is more visceral than the written word but less engaging in terms of the imagination, and many viewers don't like to work. So an offshoot of the mystery is the con film. In this case, we expect the film to surprise us. The rules are less rigid: it has to make sense at the end, but we don't need explicit clues. We do expect a narrative upset at the end. In the best of these, we are drawn into a story that we invest in -- the more sense it makes, the greater the upset.

This scam is a larger twist than normal, but is is really easy to anticipate because of how the story unfolds. The setup is so elaborate, and the characters so cartoonishly extreme that we know from the first scene who the real artist is. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a film.

Part of the game in the con setup is the language along the way. Its a trick of Shakespeare's that Mamet has embraced. The more engaging the language and related metaphors, the more investment we have in what is overturned. It is the only reason Mamet uses the form I believe -- it is the best way to leverage his skill. The language here could be particularly spellbinding in Spanish, but certainly not in the English subtitles.

The title (and hence the maguffen) derives from a basic card scam, not explained here.

Near the beginning is some masterful editing, showing a deep fabric of crookedness when the same is described.

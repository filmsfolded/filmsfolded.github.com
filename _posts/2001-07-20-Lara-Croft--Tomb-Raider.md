Spoilers herein.

Here we have a film based on a game, but the connection is very incidental. There are lots of films that share this problem of mapping from books, comics, games, TeeVee, to film, and many of them solve it the same way: they introduce a geek.

Geeks posses a magic in today's world, as the divide between the technically competent and the rest accelerates. The geek here takes on the role of collaborator and creator of the world in the first part. In the second part, he merges with a Hamlet-like ghost and as in Hamlet is the magic behind the world of the tombs.

Lara 'Crafted' is much less sexy in her domain in the film than in the game, and all the investment in the film is made in the invisible geek. It is he that battles the evil conspiracy (that he helped create), providing 'pointers' to the actress (and if the film worked: the audience). He even (both as the Dad and the creator of the game) constructs Lara.

Strange thing about films with orreries, those planetary machines. Dark Crystal, Hudson Hawk and now this -- they all failed in precisely the same way.

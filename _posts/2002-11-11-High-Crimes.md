Ashley has groomed her neck and knows how to use it. Watch how her short red hair is changed as the picture develops. Morgan Freeman does his one character again. 

The first three quarters of this is a rather ordinary police procedural wraps around a mystery. All it does is keep us busy for the twist at the end. The model is that Agatha Christie trial movie where the innocent accused gets off. And then we find out he is guilty. Its a very clever narrative device, and it really works. The woman who was physically threatened to save her husband becomes threatened by him. Its good.

The tired bits are the drunk lawyer thing, the supertrained killer thing, and the truth hidden by bad generals.

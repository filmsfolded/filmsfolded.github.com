Spoilers herein.

I had a lot of trouble with this film. I get what it is trying to do and particularly appreciate  the notion. The distance between the story and the music is like that great bowling alley  scene in 'Buffalo 66' (and the similar bowling alley scene in 'Lebowski'. The distance  between the film mystery and mystery films is something like 'Murder by Death,' but less  manic.

Each actress gets her turn at a showcase scene and her scene which turns the story. But  only three are intelligent enough to place themselves in that odd place of the film. Of  these, only good old Isabelle Huppert masters the situation. Because the actresses don't  understand the tone, the film seems somewhat silly.

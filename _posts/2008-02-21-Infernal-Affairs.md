This is an incredibly sad movie.

Its because it is pretty good. Its tight. Its completely coherent. The narrative veers in odd directions just before you expect it to. The pacing is just right for a mainstream picture.

What's sad in watching it is knowing Scorceses's remake, something that follows this very closely. People seem to like the fact that its sparkly in terms of the characters. It was almost tolerable for me when I watched it. But seeing how this roots the story, and how Scorcese's blind spot kills him... its enough to make you worry, even cry for the state of cinema.

Scorcese's a good man. He loves cinema and the world is far better off for him in it, just on his preservation efforts, and promotion of film as a sort of art. But his curse is that he is locked in an Italian mind. He has only one way of telling a story. In his world, all creation flows from individuals. Those individuals bend the universe. If you understand their motives, you understand how the world works, at least the world you experience in the film.

Actors think they love this, because it empowers them. But it also gives them no support, no cosmos in which to exist. They have to carry the entire narrative burden on themselves. That's why you have such colorful characters: thugs and such. And its why you need such extreme and un- nuanced actors, who can only bulldoze through. He's been doing it long enough that he knows how to make it work.

But then you see this. Its eight dimensions more full. Yes, it is less loud, less aggressive in terms of personal projection. But it works at such a deeper level that one wonders why we even tolerate Scorcese and his friends. 

In this film, the filmmaker and writer have created a world, two worlds actually. These two worlds interact, but largely stay statically opposed. As with ordinary noir, a simple soul finds himself caught up in the dynamics of the world he is in, mostly hapless in terms of what happens. He can only respond. How he responds is what makes the narrative.

The trick in this story is that there are two worlds, and people from each caught in the other. So the tension between the two worlds can be dramatized as the tension between two men (and their sponsors). Not as bombast, but as human. Honor and survival mean something because there is a context, not just an assertion.

In this story, some men don't survive. They are the Scorsese types.

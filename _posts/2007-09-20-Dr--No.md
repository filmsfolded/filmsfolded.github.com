I remember these early Bond films. I remember us liking them so, thinking they were suave, sexy and engaging.

We bought the fantasy of "atomic" powered rays that defeated "free world" rockets to the moon, and that those rockets meant something important. We glossed over the profoundly cheap sets and effects, closer to "Plan 9" than what we have today. We set aside the high school acting and the goofy fights. The cheap gloves hat stand in for mechanical hands. We even set aside the fact that the "girls" here aren't all that attractive, except one is in a small (for the era) bathing suit.

We set this all aside when it was new and liked it enough to want to see dozens more, each adjusting to modern norms of gadgets and stunts.

Why? Why did this franchise survive this excrescence? Its probably because we allowed more in terms of what our minds filled in, so the production deficiencies didn't matter. In fact that "filling in" also allowed us to fill in other details: the sex we don't see. This was the period of the rise of Hugh Hefner's great Playboy philosophy, and this is where it found it most attractive host. Sean Connery was lucky enough to fit the role of what we expected in this great adventure: serial sex. 

It probably actually helped that the Bond undercurrent was violent (with Connery saying in interviews that sometimes a woman just needed to be smacked). Its an odd effect that later Bonds became more and more gadget-oriented. I put that down to the way Men's magazines made money. Oh, they attracted readers because of the sex. But they made money by selling adds for expensive consumer luxury gismos (and clothes). The market folds things; especially these sorts of things that are anticipative lives.

Note: Miss Moneypenny is NOT redheaded here. She would be afterward as smarter people became involved in engineering the series.

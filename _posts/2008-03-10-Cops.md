This is a relatively early Keaton short, one of the first where he clearly designed the sight gags.

Its a conventional chase setup, with him being chased by hundreds of cops. It starts slowly, and the first half is way below par.

But then we move into Keaton territory with some stunts so physically extreme and dangerous its amazing that he survived. We don't yet have any that involve huge machines or buildings, but this is snappy and the pace is perfect once it gets going.

I'm not sure whether its perfect because he found the right pace, or because he established it and it seems right.

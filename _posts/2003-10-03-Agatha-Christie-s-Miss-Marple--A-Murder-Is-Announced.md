Spoilers herein.

Christie is all about the game, the game for control over an abstract field where the narrator lives, the person that creates the world. Within this, she often places people who are doing the same. These are people who are bending the world around them, wresting with truth as it turns out.

The BBC is about something altogether. No challenge, just simple, digestible pleasures in the form of interesting faces and places. They have a habit of swapping the creative team so that so that none of these Marple mysteries has the same director or adapter. The result is that though apparently similar, they are in fact amazingly diverse, almost a lesson in elementary filmmaking.

Christie's device here is also her clue. That's the way she often worked. Here, it is a matter of the definition of sisterhood. We have the two rough lesbians, and (apparently) the two subliminal ones. We have the twin sisters separated at birth and the sisters whose revelation is the crux. We even have twin lamps and twin romances.

(As with most of her books, we have a writer in the action.)

Christie plus BBC in this case means exaggeration of the characters so that they are no longer possible schemers, instead obvious fictions. Quite apart from Christie's carefully woven plot, we know who the villain is because she is the only one not portrayed ridiculously.

These should never have been made. The intent of the BBC is just too far from Christie's.

But. But, dear reader, there is a performance so charming it rivets. Samantha Bond isn't a great actress, but she does understand what is going on in this BBC/Christie clash. She places herself where Christie would be: both participant and commenting observer at the same time. For some interesting reason, hidden in film history, redheads can do this with more ease on the screen. I'm digging into this.

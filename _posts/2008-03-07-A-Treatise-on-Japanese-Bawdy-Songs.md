Four Japanese high junior school boys are obsessed with sex. They encounter their teacher out drinking and he sings/teaches a bawdy song about whose permission you need to ask before sleeping with a girl. "Sleeping with" means essentially raping. 

The drunk teacher accidentally dies, kicking off a more abstract round of imaginary acts of the quartet, beginning with the rape of their female teacher in class while other students placidly watch. They incessantly chat about and imagine what they would do with their classmates.

The leader of the gang ties up with the teacher's girlfriend and that's when some of the most impressive imagery appears, during a party-funeral peppered with bawdy songs. The casket is draped in an American flag. The funeral devolves into a battle between those songs and religious ones, mirroring a battle between Japan and the US (or alternatively Korea). 

I'm uncharacteristically explaining this because you probably will not ever the film.

The last ten minutes is a lecture in the class by the girlfriend about the honor of the Japanese people while the students hesitantly attempt the much discussed rape of the girl in seat 468. The lead student kills the girl to prevent the rape.

I came to this because I valued my experience with "All About Lily Chou Chou," and wanted to experience much the same thing in a more vintage original. It lacks the power I expected. Stick with "Lily Chou."

It is much more complex but less effective than "Realm of the Senses" shot a decade later.

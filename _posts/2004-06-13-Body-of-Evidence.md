Spoilers herein.

I often run across movies where the idea of the thing is much richer than the thing itself.  In this case, the idea starts with that narrative battleground, the trial. Trial movies are  cool, the best solution to the untrusted narrator problem. In this case, the viewer doesn't  know who to trust: sometimes you actually SEE conflicting versions from different  viewpoints. 'Rashomon' is perhaps the touchstone for this device.

Whoever thought this up added in another conflict: that between the vision of the writer  (or director) and the actor's persona. This is literally a case of whether a body can be  used as a weapon. Acting as sex is a rather old idea.

The selection of actors shows that the producers wanted people who know how to work  with these ideas, at least in the case of Dafoe (see "Boondock", Moore ("End of Affair") and  Archer.

But as you almost certainly know, Madonna's persona proves vacant and the director's  vision has no center. 'Crash' is what you want to watch to see the idea of sexual  deviation as performance. Or 'Cook, Lover.'

Spoilers herein.

Peter Greenaway wishes he made this film, which is pretty high praise indeed.

And that's the most puzzling thing about 'Blue Velvet.' Lynch's talent here is in connecting his imagination directly to the viewer's mind without benefit of structure or coherence -- much in the line of Eisenstein and Tarkovsky.

Greenaway is all about coherence, a particularly intelligent notion of coherence. What Lynch did in 'Mulholland Drive' had a novel structure, something missing here. As a result, I consider this much the inferior project. What we have here is the intuitive link, the effect only. The control of style but not yet of narrative.

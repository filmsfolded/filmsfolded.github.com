Some films are just ribbon. They do not intend anything beyond being a simple palliative. You'll find these in the "feel good" section. 

In this case, we have our man, unhappy with himself and with father and girlfriend problems. By the end he will have found himself, we know for sure. There will be nothing along the way we can use. Nothing. Too bad, because the setup has him in a grocer's van as a surrogate traveling theater. We know this is intended because his on-off girlfriend is doing a thesis on performance, in Almodovar-influenced Spain. But the filmmaker chose to ignore this.

This does have a few likable women, some pleasant enough scenery and superb sound design.

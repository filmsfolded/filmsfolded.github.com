Sometimes the best experiences are watching movies that are bad but nearly good.

That's because movies are all in the same class of languages, meaning they all say different things, but in the same way. So when you watch a movie, in a sense you are watching all the others you have, and in a stranger sense all the movies ever watched by anyone who has had anything to do with this one.

That means that when you watch, you make up your own movie out of stuff that isn't necessarily on screen but is in your situation of recalled narratives. In other words, you see it in context of other movies, and especially those that were good. What this means for me is that unless I truly am captured and fall into the story, losing myself, I watch it with an eye to how it could or should have been. That's easier when the movie is quite bad but almost good, and its more effective when the movie is from the 1930s decade when the vocabulary was still malleable. 

This movie has Cooper in a type of role that Cary Grant mastered, a role where the character is a knowing character, who mugs for the audience and winks at the camera, occasionally stepping out of the role. It isn't what I call folded acting, where these things are done simultaneously, like Tuvan throatsingers. Cooper can't quite get it: he's actually serious. He actually thinks he is playing a rich guy with (for Cooper) complex attributes. His co-star gets it, moving in and out of supporting what the movie needs to work and what her character needs to have her scheme work.

In the middle is a reference to "Taming of the Shrew" that has a rather complex generation. The point of that play (if you are a highschooler) is that the wit of the husband is turned on his wife to neutralize her faults. Here, through an equally complex setup, we are introduced to the notion of taking a bit of complex writing (represented by the word "Czechoslovakia") and "reading" it backwards to "enter dreams."

Read "Shrew" backwards and you get a wife taming her husband and the husband's excesses are similar to those of Petruchio in the play. Its an extremely rich and promising notion, and you can see Billy Wilder's mind behind it. There's even an end in a place (a crazyhouse) where people believe they are something they are not -- and our wayward man gets tamed, literally in a straitjacket.

Bur everything is off. Cooper is inadequate as mentioned. The comic idea requires something more deft than the screwball formula which was then already mature. And the script has all sorts of false starts. For instance, there's a commanding wheelchair-bound woman who is head of the wife's family. That family is either impoverished or completely fictitious nobility who live for the dependent scam. We have them in the beginning, the part I believe Wilder influenced the most, but she and they disappear when the mechanics of delivering the "lesson" take over. Then we enter something else, dull and halfwitted, inherited from the previous version.

See if you can figure out why Wilder spends so much time on a Louis XIVth bathtub and why that man's death was so important to mention several times.

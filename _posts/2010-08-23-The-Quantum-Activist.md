Gosh, yet another something to buy as a shortcut to enlightenment. Yet again we encounter quantum physics as the magical combo: a scientific mystery that "proves" the mysteries beyond. Just what those mysteries are, depends on the salesman of course, but it is usually some Jungian truths presented with sparkly eyes.

In this case, we get an esteemed professor who teaches the stuff, so he must know what he is talking about, right? Oh, and he is a Hindu with spiritual awards as well, so has street cred there too. Problems:

What we have in this film is basically this one guy prattling on. I suppose one could edit this into a tight film like Linklater did in "Waking Life," or could spread out like we saw in "Ayurveda." Of we could have amusing animations like "What the ##."

You have to know a few things. One is that just because someone teaches accounting doesn't mean he has insights into the dynamics of the economy. Quantum mechanics is clerical work; it is quantum logic (or whatever you choose to call the principles when divorced from physics) that is where the mysteries lay. You should also know that there is a long and seamy relationship between spiritual pitchmen and scientific notions: magnetism, vibrations, relativity, the fourth dimension have all had their turn as proof without realizing that they are metaphor.

This is bad filmmaking, bad science and unconvincing spiritual wisdom. I would point the student to "Andrey Rublyov" instead.

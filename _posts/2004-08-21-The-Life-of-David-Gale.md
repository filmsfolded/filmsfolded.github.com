Spoilers herein.

This is a suffocating film about suffocation, a simple story about a philosophy professor  written by a philosophy perfessor (no foolin), an invented story about another invented story  that proves to have been invented because of another story. It is a film about a film. 

It features Spacey as the untrusted narrator who tells us a bunch o stuff that turns out to be  lies. True to Spaceyitis, we are spoonfed the correct answer at the end. It also features Kate  Winslet, who may be our best actor for this sort of folded project. She literally has the job of  projecting the movie in flashbacks from the reactions on her face as Spacey 'tells' her.

And it has Linney, whose earnest energy with the other two would have make a politician's  funeral interesting if that dud Parker wouldn't keep getting in the way. He's nearly as bad as  Mark Herman and if it hadn't been for 'Fame,' he'd still be pasting up billboards.

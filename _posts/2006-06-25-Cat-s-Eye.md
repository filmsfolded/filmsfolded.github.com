One of the strongest influence in cinematic storytelling was a TeeVee show called "The Twilight Zone." It was headed by Rod Serling, who hosted the show and wrote the defining episodes. He also headed several writing schools, one of which was advertised on tens of millions of matchbook covers.

Nearly everyone in the writing business then and in the upcoming generation was influenced by him, one way or the other, especially so far as "horror-fantasy," the short form, and presentation on film.

The most successful acolyte of Serling is King. Though he doesn't hawk his writing formula, his amazing success has been as influential.

The formula has cleanliness as its chief value. The show is about one narrative thread, one uncomplicated story. Everything that we see should support that thread, nothing else should ever be shown or even be acknowledged incidentally. The story has to have a twist and the more strange the driving energy, the less radical the twist needs to be.

Mamet, though he presents himself as highbrow, is actually in the Serling-King school.

I find these things to be little machines that work, but completely incidental to life, like a windup toy that moves in an amusing way. You can watch it, but not use it in actual creative play, the stuff of life.

This is a good example of King. Though many films have been made of King material, few have stuck close to what he actually wrote. This does, so if you are curious about the formula, here's good study material. Otherwise, better to find somewhere else to play.

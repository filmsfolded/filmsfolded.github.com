Spoilers herein.

Oh those war films!

In times of national crisis, movies tend to be more idealistic and maternal. I believe that  wars are supported by the populace in large measure because they believe they are  fighting for ideals. WW II was the first war where those ideals were defined (on all sides)  by film images.

This film is set in England, but produced by and filmed in California. It targets Americans  and American yearnings.

Everything is background to three characters here. 2 kids and their Mom. Velvet is  perfect, perky, irrepressibly hopeful. Her Mom is similarly extreme as an all-knowing  demigoddess. Then there's spunky Donald. He is as unreal, but in a direction that is not  connected to reality - more precisely the unreal reality of the women.

I'm a believer in 'folding' as a prevalent and successful storytelling technique. A basic  rule is that if your story is divorced from reality (and all are in some way) then you have  to have something in the film that is as divorced from the reality of the film as the film is  to the viewers' life. That folding in this case is Donald, who towards the beginning  underscores the role by emphasizing what he has captured and at the end wanted to be  captured on film.

How ironic that this icon of matronly wisdom, someone who helped define American  motherhood (and won an Oscar to boot) would be hounded out of the business by the  'House UnAmerican Activities Committee.' 

Incidentally, we have some good tracking shots here when the action is in the real  outdoors.

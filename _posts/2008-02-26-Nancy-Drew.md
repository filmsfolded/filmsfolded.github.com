Its silly of course. But if you study movies, you'll like the way they solved certain problems.

You have the problem that Nancy is a vintage character, so you set her as a modern teen obsessed with vintage items and attitudes. And you devise a side story about the jaded modern kids adopting her styles and presumably interests.

You have the problem that the original character was too young. Its a target demographic thing, so you make her older -- old enough to own a car. So you bracket her with a younger kid who has a crush on her.

You have to address the "single parent" problem because its all about nostalgic values. So you craft characters that all (in so far as we know) are single parents.

But the big thing is that its a movie and not a book, so you have to adapt the mystery. How? Why making it a mystery about movies, so that there is folding with the movie within, the villain being a "watcher" of both. You stage (without any explanation) the climax trademarked kidnapping in a derelict theater, presumably a movie theater.

Even in the most ordinary manufactured movie, you can see certain narrative principles at work.

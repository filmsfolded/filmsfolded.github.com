Spoilers herein.

One wonders what the pitch was: Two hot babes to target two demographics? Non-stop comedy, with lots of dick jokes? Constant twists and turns in the con? Some touching drama about relationships? Or a vanishingly small dollop of all four for the director to grow based on first class acting talent? I suspect the last. Surely, we have had thin ideas before that a talented group brought to life.

But this group can't do it. The problem seems to be Weaver. She sorta kinda worked in her last outing as a washed up B-level actress, well past physical attractiveness. But comedy takes real talent. Harrison Ford can't do it. Julia Roberts can't. Weaver can't. 

Hackman by now just shows up and doesn't try anymore. Sad.

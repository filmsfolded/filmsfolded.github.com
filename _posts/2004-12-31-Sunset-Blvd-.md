This is often cited as the first and sometimes the best of explicitly folded films. That's where you have a film within a film and the two merge. It isn't the first or nearly the best of course, but because it was made by a slick Hollywoood director is seems simpler than it is.

The setup is simple: the outside movie is the one we are watching (obviously), reinforced by the control of a voice-over. The movie within is the fantasy world of an aging actress, "directed" by her husband-butler-director (played by a real director. They are missing a writer which is where the crossover occurs. We watch as the writer becomes engaged (literally as it turns out) to write the inner movie. He escapes at night to write a third movie, presumably all three to be produced by deMille who plays himself. The three merge at the end, resulting in the writer's death.

We know something is up at the very beginning. The original "writer" is portrayed as monkey, literally. On the monkey's death, they expect a replacement and prepare a room. The machinery of noir fate directs our hapless writer to that room (a hack plot device having to do with a car repo).

Folded films don't often provide room for folded acting, usually the two are are distinct. Most viewers of the film will think it merely an opportunity for an aging actress to play an aging actress, something like "All About Eve" of the same year (and which influenced this project).

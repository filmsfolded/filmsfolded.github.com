I'm not very familiar with Indian cinema, but it seems that the Bollywoord formula is easy to understand.

I was sent to this as a gentle introduction, partly because my friend know I would immediately pick up the reference.

It seems that the songs and stories are all predetermined. All the characters and situations. The only thing that varies is the setting, and often -- I am told -- they take that from other films. Here it is clearly "Moulin Rouge," one of my deepest film experiences. And they do it well, thoroughly. 

There's something to admire in the process of production design, when it does something like this that is both coherent and borrowed. I imagine it as a sort of rebirth of the Hollywood studio system from the 40s, where professionals were highly tuned to making collective visual imagination real -- a sort of Hindu Lubitsch.

There are probably four or five significant things that I think break the world. One of them is TeeVee. I came to this because it was recommended, because it was a documentary and because it is about something that interests me. 

What a mistake. Its TeeVee. That means:

-- it will be narrated in a breathless way as if it were a fairy tale redirected to celebrity gossip. 

-- it will be divided into small bits to accommodate commercials so there can be no real long form.

-- it will have a scene for every sentence said on the assumption that we don't want to know, but to see. So when something doesn't have apt historical footage, something else is substituted, perhaps even scenes from fictional movies.

-- it will pretend to be about the bridge. But because we are assumed to be too obsessed with "personal stories" it will be about the people who built the thing.

-- because a major part of the viewership is captured channelsurfers, there needs to be a small drama every couple minutes, even if just a local climax in the narrator's voice.

-- and finally because the quest is to support all the above, the facts and fascinating complications become disposable.

There are some interesting shots here of the bridge and of the opening and anniversary celebrations, but no more than you can get from a good book on the subject. Probably reading still matters when it comes to history.

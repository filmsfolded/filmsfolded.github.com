Spoilers herein.

Mark Rydell creates dramas that are supposed to bump people up against each other in raw places. We are thus supposed to get insight into the human condition. Its an idea often explored in theater, and spills over to the sorts of filmed plays that some filmmakers and viewers favor.  But its a rare when the writer finds a situation that actually does engage us and take us to places we didn't know.

This is not such a film. Quite apart from the lesbian subject it is illconceived.

But I am interested in how redhaired woman are used iconically. Here, Anne Heywood is made redder than usual. Was deliberate. Why?

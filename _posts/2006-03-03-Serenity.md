I saw this on DVD, and suggest you do too. That's because it has an introduction by the writer-director in which he goes through the standard bonding pitch about this movie being the result of engagement by the loyal audience.

He then goes on to say that if it sucks, its that audience's fault. Its a terrific introduction. Its slick and perfectly paced, has a twist you don't really notice. And like the movie itself...

well, it sucks in an important respect. And it is our fault. 

The good is the stuff that's been trumpeted: it is well paced. It knows its business, like the characters know theirs. It is relentless in being entertainment. Anything that deviates from that mission, like being original and worthwhile, is jettisoned. The pacing is tight tight tight. The dialog is snappy and economical. The effects are well done, enough so for us to enjoy the ride. 

In all these regards, it is better as sheer entertainment than any of the Star Wars movies, and of course the relatively pedestrian Star Treks. And it seems to provide a simple enough cosmology of life to attract those that yearn such.

Some commentors also note that this is more of a selfaware quote of genres, mostly cow and hardware operas than projects that take themselves more seriously. I'm not sure whether it is the competence in pacing or the slight self-awareness that makes this so popular with fans. Or even whether a portion of society needs a continuing metaphor of a simple life.

That's the part that bothers me. If this were an honest genre film, it would be tolerable. Or alternately if it were a deeply folded exploration of the issues it brushes, it might strike me as real art, important, useful, relatively bottomless. 

But it wants it both ways. It is a new genre that hiply quotes others, creating a movie about movies, but it wants all of the slick, automatic responses that you get from a genre film. In other words, it follows a formula to the tee, but stands off from that formula in a sort of herd of nonconformists.

The story follows this tone. Insight, sortof in a psychic who also kicks ass. Zombies as the encircling Indians, explained by some faux sci-fi mechanism (a drug with unintended consequence), the weight of "Forbidden Planet" with none of the handles.

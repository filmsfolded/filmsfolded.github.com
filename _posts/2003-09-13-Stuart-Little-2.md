Spoilers herein.

I am really enjoying big kids movies. That's because they are so well engineered -- a  little skill in understanding what works adds up to big DVD sales. In this case, we have  something that superficially resembles the first film but is actually a beast of a different  order.

In this case, the whole purpose of the film is the creation of the world, slightly adjusted  from ours a half step toward fantasy. This is all built around Geena Davis, in remarkable  red hair and slightly heavy fifties pancake, makeup influenced by Julianne Moore's recent  work. She's a really clever actress who finds and communicates a niche that brings the  architecture of the thing to life. Watch what she does, and how the score extends  everything she says.

The story is only an excuse to keep things moving: but the Leeloo influence in Margalo is  strong. Watch the two films together for great fun.

As with recent fare (Pirates, Nemo, Ring, Potter), we have lots of vertical space.

Experimentation with the detective narrative continued through the fifties. Though such experiments were the engine behind noir, they continued past the point where noir was recognized as a genre. This is one such and to my mind pretty interesting, even though it was originally a play within the time period where noir existed. 

It features a detective, check. hardboiled as the genre left them. It involves profound interleaved on screen coincidences, clearly shaped because we are watching, check. We have an on screen watcher, check, who happens to be a petty thief, check (because noir makes us thieves). 

There's an emotional man-woman situation, check. What's novel -- and advertised as such at the time -- was that this treated sex in a different way, by way of judgment of abortion. 

It works for me as a dramatic machine, tuned so that every part is essential and all contributes to the single narrative: local good deeds changed to bad when seen from the outside. This is a critical turning point in the detective genre. After this, we can have Altman. 

And the actors are integrated.

I want to like Michelle. I really do and remember her commitment as an actress in 'The Baker Boys.'

I said some very bad things about her very bad performance in 'What Lies Beneath.' And I actually got hate mail. So I viewed this. I know the book, and thought it an opportunity for a competent actress. Knowing that this actress had this movie created for her, I was sure that if there is something to Michelle today, we'd find it here. 

Sorry.

Some actors give with their comrades, so a common space is created among them. Some actors act in their environment, imparting an emotional tone into the scenery. Some can project into a partnership with the viewer, leading, teasing and challenging us. Some can act with their whole body, the better ones moving around with different body parts as elements of an ensemble. Some thrill us. 

Ms Pfeiffer has none of this. Her face is her instrument, and her first duty these days is to her vanity -- we come second. A good actress could have projected over the weak script -- the idea has real meat. She is earnest enough I suppose, but were she really committed, I think she'd be able to pull this off.

Whoopie does another one of her patented wise women roles.

I can usually find something worth watching in any film. In this case the book deals with artifacts of the past as never fresh, the boy a metaphor for specific religious traditions (where the title comes from). But nothing comes through in this muddle of an adaptation.

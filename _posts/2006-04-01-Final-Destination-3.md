One thing that's so great about movies, a life in movies, is that certain features from them inveigle themselves into us, our lives and imaginations.

One dance associated with this is how genres surround one another. The good ones always seem to.

This is ostensibly a kiddie horror movie, what would have been drive-in fare in a prior era. Some humor, some deaths that personality-starved boys can cheer and role-seeking girlies can be repulsed by. Some "sense" to the story.

But you know that noir is the great invention of film, unique to film. Its all about a mechanical fate capturing our hapless characters and tossing them about. It seems random and incredibly dependent on unlikely happenstance to this in the movie, but yet to the viewers it translates to whatever values you need to sell tickets. Right?

This disparity, this dissonance in worlds, ours and theirs is spooky stuff and much mined. Underlying it is often the notion that there's more to it than us just watching something, that our watching is what causes the disasters we see in the lives we watch. Lots of examples here.

So what does Wong do? He creates a character who watches and causes. Look how cleverly she is defined to stand for both the filmmaker (every death is codified in a photograph taken at an amusement park!) and us -- every death is witnessed by her except one.

That one death (two dumb, vain cheerleader types) was almost enough for me to abandon this movie because it was so obviously inserted by the producers. It doesn't fit anything else in the thing, not in the machinery of the events, the tone, the humor -- and especially this notion that our Wendy is a sort of Peter Pan Wendy whose subconscious wishes make the things we both "see" happen.

Except for the tanning bed cookery, the deaths have an elaborate machinery associated with them, very ultranoirish. That's the humor, a self-referential goof on the causality. If you follow the machinery, its not so much Rube Goldbergish, because the point there is in the indirect nature of how things happen. Here, it is the relentlessness of the causality combined with the trickery involved.

The cool thing is that none of that causal trickery is seen by the victim, only us, the causal watcher.

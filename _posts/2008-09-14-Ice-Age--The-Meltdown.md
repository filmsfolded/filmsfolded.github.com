Full feature animation has settled into two paths which will never again pass. One is the long form narrative which makes animated films no different than most other movies, real movies. The other is a collection of jokes. Now there are lots of non-animated movies that have adopted this strategy as well, but cartoon jokes have different rules. They are more extreme in situation and character, but they depend on an ordinariness and familiarity for their baseline.

Watching one of these hurts your soul, I am convinced, because it trains you to not actually notice the story, the ideas, the emotions. It hurts the whole world, because if we cannot see beyond the joke, the simple shot, we elect dummies. We marry for fun. We school to tests.

This should be boycotted. The entertainment value is so slight to be essentially naught. And the harm is significant.

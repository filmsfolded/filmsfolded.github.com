Spoilers herein.

Projects like this are easy to read: it was made to exploit the then 'young teen' appeal of Reese. Because the project has this direct goal, all other dimensions of the project have been made as safe and predictable as possible. All formulas that can bear on this work, do. The result is tedious unless you are in the groove to get the one intended value: the appealing, fawnlike innocence of Reese.

It is my own theory that kids are simple in their energies but sophisticated in their abstractions, so they would much rather see something with layered ironies that something 'clean' like this. But if you do see this, it is at least interesting to see what Hollywood considers certain stereotypes, in particular the oft-used architect father.

That stereotype started - I surmise - in a self-referential context: the architect in the film creates a world like the filmmaker creates with the film. Often that world becomes a plot device as here: he has created a seemingly impregnable fortress. Architecture in film has a rich legacy, and consequently has its own stereotypes in kiddie films, like 'Glass House' and here. But look at the actual architecture of this house. It is as appallingly simple, easy to read and unimaginative as the film.

An unrelated oddity. A disproportionate number of young actresses are blond. But look at their images on the DVD covers and you will find most of them portrayed as redheads. Now why is that do you think?

How odd this thing seems, 55 years after its making.

It is a little detective yarn (presumably for TeeVee) made to appear as if it were made in 1933. Already that era was remembered brightly enough to be valued as a touchstone: solid mind entering perfidious situations with blinds and hidden schemes.

The production values, sets and era of the story are all from the 30s. Unfortunately, when you make something that appears old, you have only two choices. You can replicate it, but if you do, you have to match not what was, but what people recall of what was. And sometimes that is unattainable.

Or you can create something that has two layers, the recreated one and the "present," self- aware one. Almost everyone chooses this path because it is easier, more hip and allows for cleverness.

This project makes the first choice. And fails.

Its anyone's guess whether you will appreciate the mix here: the comedic thriller hybrid that depends on British notions of what is funny and what emotionally touching. For me, it doesn't work as intended, and I suppose that's just a matter of shifting norms and my inability to fool myself into being a Brit of fifty years ago.

That Reed would even attempt this is curious, and I suppose in its day it worked. I further suppose that it worked because of some narrative folding. Further, I presume (to judge from what he has said) that an awareness of this came from his friend Orson Welles.

The effect here is that we see a story. Its a particular kind of story, a spy story, whose main claim to being is that is based on some real dynamics -- that there are actually people that do this sort of thing and that it happens in more or less the same way. Now watch: what we actually get is something designed to amuse: instead of getting the "real" spy story, we get one that is a response to what we want to see. The producers therefore make more money.

The story? Well, it is of a spy who instead of reporting what really is happening, makes up what he thinks his "viewers" will like. Its a simple narrative fold, with a small embellishment that the "spy" does this to allow his nitwit daughter to exist in her own fantasy world. A special touch is that the reference book used for the code is a retelling (for similar nitwits) of Shakespeare's stories to make them less complex and more entertaining.

The tone is set at the beginning when an ordinary Cuban man and woman, strangers, seduce each other by tossing an apple. Its an economical way of denoting economy. 

The story is set in Cuba in a time just before the revolution and filmed just after, in that small window before the US decided to punish Castro. So the surrounding tone of the thing is also about a fantasy doubly overwoven on reality.

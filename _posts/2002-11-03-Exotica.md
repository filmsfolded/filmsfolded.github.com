Spoilers herein.

Many of the most intelligent films begin with the notion that life is a performance, possibly an acting out of remembrances. Then, as the filmed performance of that life performance unfurls, we have amble opportunity for layer shifting and ambiguities... lots of things that amplify power like the notion of an actor who is acting that they are acting, or better: not acting, just "staying."

We have here one of the tightest films I've ever encountered. The stance of the acting, the braiding and mirroring in the story, the score and the camera eye are completely congruent. So completely congruent that I have placed it as a 4 of 4, which is more than just a good film. In my system, it denotes required viewing, sort of an equivalent of Bloom's list of great books without which one cannot invent intelligence.

The trip is rugged, demanding but rewarding.

We have a young woman acting as a schoolgirl and providing succor to a wounded gent. We have her former lover, damaged and bitter at his frustrations, 'directing' her. Both work for someone who hides addiction under the blanket of tradition. The wounded gent is incapable of performance (even 'touching') so acts as codependent, demanding recipient of performances.

This is the stuff of life that anyone experiences. Here, it is framed within a certain kind of stage.

Within this, we have watchers, auditors, voyeurs, monitors, toilet interlocutors, two-way mirrors. We also have pregnancy, eggs, children... and death. The bearer of eggs (soon to be lost to love) and the wounded gent are thrown together, and thus begins the braid. 

The end of the braid puts us at the point where one performance cannot continue, but the other must go on. Is it "reality" that continues?

Ted's evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this.

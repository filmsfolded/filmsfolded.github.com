Spoilers herein.

After watching thousands of horror movies over fifty years, you reach a plateau of sorts. They  all have less than great acting and production values. In some respect, that's why the genre  exists.

At this zen plateau, you can spend time with the idea behind the thing. That's the important  part, the part that can haunt your dreams. And a lot of drek is pretty effective at that.

This has the clever idea that 'Ringu' would exploit: a movie that is about a movie that  generates its own monsters. The monsters cross levels. The tone is something triangulated  among John Waters, Jumanji and Gremlins.

The great idea is the framing: the movie within the movie contains a story within a story:  namely the one that the famous writer Jordan makes up about the TeeVee that is delivered to  his house. It has the trademarked Rod Serling ending, one that he would have picked up from  his matchbook school of writing.

All else is just the kind of pulp story that he might have written. Down to -- and especially --  the mirrors. I'd rather watch this that many other horror films, the one that depend on  slashed teens instead of creepy ideas.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

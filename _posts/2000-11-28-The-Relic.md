Dark. That's the good part. Also somewhat intriguing is the idea of virally induced brain-hormonally driven genetic mutation. It touches on the beast within, and conceptually frightens.

But it is all sullied by stuff jumping out of corners, and cheap characters. How this would have been improved by having the monster not growl, but gag. Since this is partly ripped off of Alien, it depends on a strong sexuality from the heroine. Penelope just doesn't have the stuff. If she did, more could have been made of her encounter with the beast and his knowledge of her recognition.

At least the best scene was the nearly last, with P being chased by a burning superman. But quickly follows the worst scene where the monster explodes into rubber pieces.

A piece of garbage? Yes, but the point is (at least of the book) so are we.

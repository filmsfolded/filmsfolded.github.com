Spoilers herein.

The first thing to decide when creating an intelligent film is who the camera is. 

We start out here with one identity and discover that we actually have another. This is a well known if rarely pulled trick in the mystery genre. Films like this are essentially mysteries, following all of the important rules. That makes them more engaging because the viewer engages in a game with the writer (and her surrogate the actor) to outwit each other.

The filmmaker here is very intelligent in leveraging this by exploiting Kidman's rather hypnotizing, slowly incubating terror.

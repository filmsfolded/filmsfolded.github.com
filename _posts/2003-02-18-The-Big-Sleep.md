I'm trying to piece together a story about noir, what it is, how it works and where it came from. 

It seems to me that noir -- what I call noir -- is bigger than what it is normally tagged as. Its deep, a new notion of how the world works and how we narrate it. I think like jazz, its peculiarly American in origin. 

The backbone of noir, I believe comes from a stew of experiments in the thirties with legs in the detective story and the movie-about-movies or "shows." It became more distinctly cinematic and tied to formal narrative devices with "Citizen Kane." That's my story and I intend sticking to it. After that, you can see how the young thing was shaped, not entirely with deliberation. I think this was a milestone of noir and much of it was by accident.

The books are based on one simple notion, I believe, that Marlowe was the only soul we see that isn't trying to force the universe, trying to be someone. He just is. He just accepts the world and what it serves up, perhaps noticing that the world seems to be designing coincidental impediments. (These are created by us watching, but that's another story.)

Plus, he is primarily motivated to "see" what things are all about. Halfway through this, he apparently solves the problem, but still has to keep looking, "detecting." 

Now for the accidental amplification of the genre. Books nearly always are reduced in translating to film. There's just more space for more events in books. But with this type of mystery, you just cannot take bits out. So Faulkner and partner kept it all in, all wedged together. Its too much and confuses the ordinary viewer, at least the kind who really wants to "understand." But the whole point of noir as it has grown up is that fate is capricious and that the world presents some "dark logic" that we can't quite reach. We can sort out the shreds that fall from the sky, but beyond is some machine that we can never see.

So the fact that this movie makes less sense than we expect matters. I think it is an accident of talent, that it wasn't intended. But its effective as all getout to be encountered with confusion just as Marlowe is, though he gets to pull his ear. And we just get to pull our eyes.

There's a strange overlay between the zen acceptance that Marlowe has for the inexplicable world, and the fact that overtly horny women flock to him. I think the attraction is less the usual wisdom and strength, but a similar sort of calmness that comes from simple recognition that the world isn't logical. 

Ted's evaluation: Worth watching.

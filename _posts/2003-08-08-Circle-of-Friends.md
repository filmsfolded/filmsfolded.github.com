Spoilers herein.

Pretty tepid and predictable, just like the society the story disparages.

And pretty ordinary in the way it exploits the themepark charm of Ireland. That's a  recurring problem with Pat O'Connor who seems doomed to his Darby O'Gill world. But it  has three strong performers, and in this case those alone are worth watching.  Incidentally those three are to be reunited for the big budget "Phantom of the Opera."

Of these three, Minni Driver impresses. She has that young abandon and commitment to  the role that is almost virginal in its approach. Like Emily Watson in "Waves" or Kate  Winslet in "Creatures" or Cate Blanchett in "Lucinda." It has something to do with  fearlessness and is most effective when the character is supposed to have that same  sense of tentative inhabitation of strange person.

Often, that ability to risk wears off, and it appears to have with Minnie. But still...

Another of these three has made a career of sleazy characters. I find Cumming's energy  pretty fascinating, especially the areas of the character where he places that energy.  These characters are always sprung, dramatic. How sweet to know that Cumming really  did walk away with Saffron when this was over.

I love swimming around in these old movies. Very few of them are worth watching for themselves. But many of them have such strange narrative experiments. You just can't honk around today like this.

Here's what this is. It part prison picture in tone. Prison movies were a staple in that era because the system was considered to be inherently unjust, and good men could easily be sent to the bighouse, with cops usually depicted as incompetent or cruel.

Its part adventure/comedy, with stolen jewels, hidden and with open slapstick toward the end.

And it partly a show movie with a song and dance number, apparently recreated from a previous film.

The film itself is dull and cheap, but the idea behind it is wild. A pudgy 5 year old can carry a film?

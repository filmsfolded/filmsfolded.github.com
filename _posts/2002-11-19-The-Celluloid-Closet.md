Spoilers herein.

I am particularly interested in films about films. Documentaries on film are generally at the dull end of the spectrum for a variety of reasons, but this one is not. That's because this film doesn't just report, it synthesizes a new narrative, thereby making a metafilm.

And there are lots and lots of films included too, as the raw material. It is not at all unlike the book on film I'm working on which tries to tell a story about how some/many films tell stories. I've thought quite a bit about what makes this meta-story 'true' in the sense that afterward people believe they had that insight all along. 

The easiest case is to spin a tale about social injustice in film. That is what is done here, rather like it was in 'Bamboozled.' It seems at first to work, but the cost is great.

The format is simple: some talking heads (or in the case of Spike, a talky story) that somehow tells us what is right, then a collection of examples with annotative explanations that match/show that truth.

The problem is the relationship that film has to the world. Powerful film invents the world, and in doing so taps into inner recesses of our imaginations and slides a few things about in there. We are unaware of how this sort of visual reasoning works on us, and that is precisely WHY it works. Logic never enters the picture. It cannot, especially political logic, and that's why this project is a mess and probably does more harm than good.

Naturally, I'm for improved social justice all around and particularly in this area. And I agree with the filmmakers that film images can do incredible, long term, unforeseeable damage in society. And my comments here do not pertain to omissions in the project or flaws in the political stance.

But consider the problem: film is artistic, not pedantic. That's where its power comes from. The more polemic you get -- the more preachy -- the less power over us any film has. Any number of examples can be given, say 'Cuckoo's Nest' or even the lesser 'Rain Man' as compared to 'I Am Sam' or 'The Other Sister.' The more we try, the less effect we can have. Imparting greater awareness of whatever problem may occur. But in this case, all the power comes from snippets of the original films themselves. No talking head here gives us anything remotely powerful in their stead except recourse to a 'Jiminy Cricket,' pretty thin stuff. And it is a step back, because with this new awareness of the problem we can feel better without having had any effect.

In other words, the situation is that film generally has a relationship to the real world. Usually, films create inner realities that give them power. That's three worlds: the real world, the film world and the world of film-within-the-film (often archetypes and stuff). The third layer is what affects the first. The second is only a channel. Documentaries like this add a fourth layer (film about film). It thinks it harnesses the parts that matter, but it only references the second layer, the one part that doesn't.

That's why Tarkovsky is alive and Stalin is not.

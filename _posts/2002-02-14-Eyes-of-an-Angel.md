Spoilers herein.

Pity the poor scriptwriter tasked with putting together a simple drama. Let's assume that he wants to have some elegance in his product.

Kids and dogs. Kind hearted but seriously flawed Dad. Pretty tired stuff. There's some attempt at competence by mirroring the chase of the dog, the gangsters and the search for parenthood.  But the best thread, and the best acting, involves the dog.

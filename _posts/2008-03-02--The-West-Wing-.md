I finally got to see two episodes of this, after hearing about it for years. This comment is filed for the series as a whole, though I understand that the qualities I liked in these fifth and sixth season episodes are not characteristic of the first three years.

I saw this on DVD so was able to avoid those distracting ads.

What I liked about this was the way they learned to pace the thing. First of all, every arc is snappy, from the rushed one-liners to the resolution of some national or international crisis. But the nesting of the arcs is really worth noticing. 

There are the 40-70 second episodes, the tiny minidramas that often consist of dialog on the run. There are the episodic divisions of think five per episode that produce a chapter between commercials. There is that situation, the crisis that the episode addresses. There is the overarching soap opera of the characters that spans episodes. And the whole thing is nested within ordinary desires to explain the world politically. We have an undying need to do this, to have a coherent political story, so to nest in these ways fills that need with entertainment which many viewers I am sure will code as enlightenment. 

I am sure that few people will be jarred as I was by seeing Martin Sheen as president, he who I know from Apocalypse Now and Malick's first movie where he was challenged to eat a dead collie, and cinematically does.

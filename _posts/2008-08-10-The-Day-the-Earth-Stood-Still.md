This old film is much admired. Most folks consider it science fiction and have it on their lists under that header; usually it is high on the list.

My enthusiasm is often unbounded when it comes to projects like this, ones that worked in their time and were successful in the way intended. And I have great respect for the sort of world bending into alternatives that often uses "science fiction" devices. But I have to report that this film leaves me with less effect than any of a hundred monster and alien movies that had less purpose in mind.

Its because the purpose is so vacuous. Was then, is now.

The science fiction device -- basically just the appearance of a demigod -- is there to support the preaching of a simple message. Now I can tell you that in this era we all were terrified. Much of this was because there was a real threat, and much because -- as today -- the administration whipped up a narrative of impending, determined evil. Everyone wished for some higher level sense of reason and most believed they were part of it. 

This simply hooked into that desire. Its not a narrative, simply a small knothole into one that already existed.

But there is something about the decisions they made. This film merely inserts a scifi plot device as I've noted. And the way they did this was to make a "real life" movie as much as possible. It seems that real Washington DC locations are used almost exclusively. The alien is as human as could be; likewise the lethal technology takes the form of a human.

Even in small things, the way scenes are framed are all borrowed from small town movies though its set in a metropolis. We even have a family grouping that would be carried nearly intact into the Mayberry context, with Aunt Bee, an Opie, a girlfriend, even (in a predictable inversion) the professor transformed into the Don Knotts character.

So there's some interesting stuff here in the decisions that filmmakers of ordinary skill made some simple decisions to enhance the effect of their film. But it isn't science fiction of any of the kinds I know. And it isn't an effective film in any way that matters.

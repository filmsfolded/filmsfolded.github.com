Spoilers herein.

This is two films in one.

The first film is about an annoying, celebrated woman, jailed by the forces of the situation she controls. She becomes surrounded by the influence of exuberant intuition. Nothing different here from the many versions of the 'Lady Chatterly' template. What makes it different is the second film, overlapped. 

This is a film about a petulant actress who insists on a certain acting style regardless of what the project demands. That's because she is a victim of the forces at her command: she commands them and they command her, forcing her to be the character she plays. It is always the same character, only slightly nuanced. It is a successful character, so we tolerate her most of the time. But there is always an underlying annoyance.

Here, she is set free by Connolly who dances around her traditional acting by his sheer intuition. Seldom do the actors so parallel the characters.

This is a good film. Madden places the camera around and about the space as if he were part of Connolly's world. Together, we Connolly, Brown and Madden conspire to unfetter this stiff actress, pathologically under the control of her own mannerisms.

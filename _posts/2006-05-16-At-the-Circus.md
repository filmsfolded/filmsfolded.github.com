Certain celebrations are inherently cinematic, and circuses compile well in the visual mind. "8 1/2" of course. I just saw an amazing little film in "Mirrormask" that leverages the circus. "Freaks" of course. and Chaplin's "The Circus."

Meanwhile, for about 5 or 6 years (and probably 10 years on stage before that), the Marx brothers were redefining comedy. We had come out of the silent period where the greats of physical comedy reigned in their own humor, invented purely for the screen. The Marxes had a verbal wit: you actually had to listen. But it was a different sort of spoken humor than was popular on the radio because the verbal wit required some visual cues. In fact, they went so far as to create a character who spoke not at all.

That was their great invention, and they chose to express it in a manner that suggested chaos. Each routine was constructed so that each step compounded the motion, built on a prior anarchy. The early films were among the funniest bits of our film legacy, which is to say they are part of the machinery of how we laugh.

But I think comedy (the real stuff) rots, it destroys itself because the material that grows it is so frangible. We break it by using it.

By this movie, the brothers were all but irrelevant. MGM decided not to make a Marx brothers movie, but a movie with crime, love, some flash (you gotta the flash?) and shoehorned in is some humor. They were only a component of a larger meal, one not designed to be friendly to them.

So watching this is a sad affair, something like seeing Fat Elvis. There isn't a funny bit in it. No energy, they were just showing up for work. There was already sickness.

The most interesting thing is the trouble they went to in Hays era to show some leg.

Eve Arden, later famous for "Our Miss Brooks" is outfitted to play the trapeze artist, which is to say she has a costume that emphasizes her legs. She does a routine several times where she has what must be magnetic shoes that allow her to walk upside down.

I can almost imagine a special department at MGM -- probably in costuming -- dedicated to the study of how muscles move in a way to make women appear sexy. That whole business of high heels still astounds me, how effective it is and how much pain we go through to sustain it.

Well, having a leggy woman hang upside down and do what must be done to manipulate those boots has a similar effect. Very deliberately exploited here. How very odd.

Two movies kept running through my eyes when watching this.

One was "Sayonara" of 57, starring Brando. It was an odd, odd movie. Its intent was to mine the exotic notions of charming Japanese women, Geisha. We were to see and appreciate the cultural difference and fall in love with it, take risks for it. But the film was laden with American cinematic values and these completely undermined that intent.

The Japanese are obsessed with style and appearance. Ritualization of the mundane. If you intend to capture that cinematically, you have to transform your eye, your mind BEFORE you start watching. Otherwise, you are merely a sexual tourist.

The other film was "Hero." I liked it a lot. Made by Chinese, set in China using Chinese history and Chinese actors. But every cinematic value, the entirely of eye and mind was Japanese. The amazingly rich collection of embedded self-reference. The use of space, of folding. The notion of the character bending space.

Now this. Again, as in "Sayonara" we are expected to see the exotic, the geisha culture and fall in love with it. Fall and spin and open. This is different than the excrescence of "The Last Samuri," in that it successfully avoids Hollywood's heavy hand. Except for the ghastly, inappropriate John Williams notions of Japanese sonic space, the film succeeds in escaping the American eye.

Some of this is due to the Australian cinematographer, a talented guy. Some is because the (eighth choice) director isn't a Hollywood film guy at all but a Broadway choreographer. But look closely. What you'll see is a Chinese movie, the exact opposite of "Hero." All the content is Japanese, all the cinema is Chinese.

Sure, I mean Chinese actresses for sure. But much, much more than that. Look at "Zhou Yu's Train" and "2046." Both of these are sublime experiences. Look at them and see how the story is irrelevant, how the camera moves as if it were part of the built environment instead of as a ghost voyeur. Look at how the bounds are given before the contents of the scene are given.

Watch how we have a distinct manner of film-making fleshed out: the outside in, the manner of the effect before the cause is made plain.

Now shift to this project and see how the creative team has copied this manner, defined by another Australian cinematographer: Christopher Doyle. But it has been copied imperfectly, so much less powerful than the real thing.

And see how the mismatch between Chinese manners and vision and Japanese modes grates. Eventually, we will see a war over such as this. And it will be bloody.

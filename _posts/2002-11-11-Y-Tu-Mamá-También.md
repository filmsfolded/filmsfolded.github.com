Spoilers herein.

Films in the US, India and Hong Kong have a happy freedom in that they can exist in a world context. All other films carry the burden of nationality, and it is a heavy burden indeed. That's because films define society and 'national' films attract undue expectations to define what it means to be French, or whatever. It is burden enough when the country has a healthy economy, a long history with film, and political stability. But when the country lacks any of these, each marginally competent film gets blown up to mythic proportions.

So it was within a whirlwind of expectations that I viewed this as a non-Mexican North American. My own experience with Spanish-speaking literature and film is relatively slight, but from 'Quixote,' through Borges, hispanics have led us all in intelligent self-reference. In the last few decades, this has merged with post-modern fabulism or 'magical reality' to produce some similarly great art.

But there is a backlash from the street, which promotes the frank, impulsive sexuality of hispanics. And so we have Spanish films that are about sensual caprice. And people flock to them for self-definition. I recently saw a most amazing film: 'Lucía y el sexo,' which to my mind was a superb blend of the two: Spanish self-aware abstraction folded into a selfserving passion for sex as life. Both literary and cinematic.

Now along comes this film, that doesn't make any such synthesis. It in fact sticks entirely to the 'passion-for-life' side, goobered up with some political commentary and wrapped in a traditional 'dying girl' wrapper. That this is deliberate can be seen in the girl leaving her writer husband, whose friends talk about intellectual things she doesn't think important. Its pleasant enough, especially the dialog, and I didn't mind watching it. But knowing that millions of Mexicans adjust their sense of self using this template is somewhat tragic.

So let's emphasize what element remains of interest: the narrative structure. There are three narrative stances here: the one within the story, centered on the boys; the 'underwater' one (presumably the placeholder for what would be the folding in a better film and presaging some new awareness in the story); and the spoken narrator. These are separated by very clever sound editing and constitute the best element of the film. All the folding is done here: for instance, one road is blocked by a traffic death and later on a different road the narrator informs us that if they had been on that road tens years prior they would have seen an accident with similar social context.

If you work hard, this spoken narration is sometimes clever but all in all you'd be far better off watching 'Lucía y el sexo,' and celebrating hispanic passion: both sensual and intellectual.

Spoilers herein.

A screenwriter has a rather big back of bag of tricks. Poor writers rely on only one or two of them. Here, the one trick is structuring around big speeches. You know the kind: each character in turn gives a pseudoShakespearian moment where grand expositions are made of life and the situation.

These speeches are pretty dreary and doom the film well before the inept actors get them.

I checked out this video because I just saw Hamlet and was completely captivated by Julia Stiles. Then I learned that she has already done three Shakespeare adaptations (this, Hamlet, O). 

This is really interesting. Is this really a talented actress (only 19) who understands something of Shakespeare and has purposefully targeted film adaptations? I've heard she was a success on TeeVee. I have to know, wondering if the flash of brilliance in Hamlet was a one-shot deal.

As for the quality of this film, I cannot say. Teen dating dramas succeed or not based on a secret, everchanging language of the subculture. I don't have a pass to that area, so must demur. This isn't much Shakespeare though, just the barest skeleton.

Her acting seems fresh, but its mighty hard to tell much here. She's not asked to do much, except for one moment when she reads a poem. Gwyneth Paltrow turned out to be limited, albeit sometimes entertaining in what she could bring to Shakespeare. Maybe Julia will do better.

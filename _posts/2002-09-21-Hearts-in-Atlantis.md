Spoilers herein.

Another formula picture about childhood discovery in the salad days, this time from the Ray Bradbury playbook. It comes close to being pleasantly dull, but it consistently moves past the cloying. This is another of Hopkins' recent 'vacation' films.

King is no dummy, he. So we have lots of the formulaic depth: the self-referential framing of a photographer revisiting his childhood, one in which he could 'see' the thoughts of others. While in this state, he conjures up (?) a similar mystically-inclined friend who constantly links the 'insight' to reading. Got it, seventh graders? 

Now the wheels turn with all the stereotypes and minicrises of the era, and guess what? A Nixonian cabal comes and takes his friend away and after that he loses the 'insight.' This is briefly recaptured when he gives a picture of his old, excessively idealized girlfriend to her daughter.

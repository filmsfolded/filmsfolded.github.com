You can come to this series looking for all sorts of pleasures.

Candidates includes Jeremy Brett's engineered nervous twitches, which you won't find here because of the drag of his mental illness. From time to time, you may also find that the adapter and filmmaker have done something clever, novel or useful with what may be one of the most useful prototypes in literature.

You won't find that here either. Some of these simply plod and this is about the most plodding. So I'd recommend that you stay away. That is, except for one silly thing.

I just saw Jude Law in "Closer." He was outclassed by one other actor in that project, but surely crossed a threshold to become a real actor in the sense of becoming someone real enough to register and theatrical enough to for us to read him without knowing how.

You can see a nineteen year old Jude Law here, playing a minor but pivotal role in the mystery. He's completely unremarkable except that we recognize him. Its a very odd experience to see a historical artifact of someone and credit him with goodwill because of something he would do much later. A mystery.

Spoiler here: he plays an actor.

Spoilers herein.

Most films are not about life, but about other films. Sometimes you get one that recasts old forms and sets new cultural milestones.

Just a couple years before, Bronson was a part of a rag-tag group in the US remake of 'The Magnificent 7.' Then, that same ethos of inventive rebel was recast into patriotic honor with the Americans in the 'Great Escape.' This was one of the defining archetypes of the culture, just in time to catch and influence the Vietnam era. Now, the idea is brought home more clearly: rank criminals with defining but limited honor.

What's unique about this film: the bad guys aren't the Nazis -- it is them, their servants and women, the whole complicit people. Behind the humor of the middle part is a more harrowing reality of that war than seen in 'Private Ryan' and the ilk: the war was brought by and fought against the German people. No honor on either side, only film justice.

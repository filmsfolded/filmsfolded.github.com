Spoilers herein.

Gosh I had high expectations. I'm used to experiments which attempt different things at  the same time. We've become so used to the medium that we become blind to how one  element constrains another. Often when someone does something radical, we see that  radical thing and think the effect of it is the main idea. But in Figgis, Lynch, Greenaway,  Hartley and so many others, they do that one thing so it gives space for another, and that  other is where the magic, the art is.

I looked for that exploitation of a hidden opening here.

It is not there. I suggest you see ' A Walk Through H,' instead for what this advertises.

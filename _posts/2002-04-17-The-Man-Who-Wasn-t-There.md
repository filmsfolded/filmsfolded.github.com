Spoilers herein.

It has long been an accepted film studies proverb that films are seldom about life, but about other films. The Coens are the leading champions of this in their art. Every film is about the filmmaking process, the whole process that includes how we tuck it away and use it in our lives.

So all their films are about this process. They apparently only let the actors see the miniscule part of that process that they need to know. Billy Bob, for instance clearly believes that the film is a story about him, and the material on the DVD confirms this fiction. But the brothers laugh at Bob's insignificance just as they laugh at Ed's. 

(Last time around, they jerked Clooney's chain in just the same way as events in the story jerk his character.)

This is all metafilm, and part of the game is to tease out threads and images and characters and names. The joke is all on the reuse of this stuff. We base our life on these images, and we can only do so because we do not know that we do. The more we examine it the less natural they seem, so that guy Fritz or Werner tells us. The real narrator is the lawyer.

I'm darn glad these guys were around. But at a certain level of exposure, they've made their point. But they are young men yet and someday they might turn all this oneiric mastery to actually change us. Change us, that is, in a more profound way than simply showing us what slaves to the filmed image we are.

The Black and White is not. Rather it is shot on color stock, then printed as B/W on color stock. I believe it is done this way as a matter of keeping with economies of scale, but a serendipitous effect occurs -- on the screen but not the DVD which just turns everything to dark green. But on the screen the result is rather like the whites and greys of snow. These appear white from far away, but in fact are millions of points of color. A big white movie screen will do this anyway as a result of the refractive physics of the silica. But the effect is greatly enhanced using black on color stock. Subliminally hypnotizing, and -- some theorize -- the phenomenon behind many UFO encounters.

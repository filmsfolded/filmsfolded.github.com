Spoilers herein.

Although blunt and clumsy, this film transports one -- especially a male -- to a place never visited. That's in part because of the unflinching honesty of the narrative stance; never wavering from the girl's perspective. It it were more familiar territory, like Jane Campion's, it would be a failure -- or if it wavered into observation (like "Claire's Knee") rather than experience.

The tone and structure is taken from "Alice in Wonderland:" the episodic shifts into fantasy, the Red Queen, the effete King, the "Jack" (here a lumberjack) the ink, the worm and flies, the tarts, the "tunnel," the focus on song. Alice is a remarkably common metaphoric structure for such visual explorations of sexual angst. I was very impressed with another sexual Alice: "Sex and Lucia" which engaged with the folding of perspectives and realities rather than as here the nearfamiliar strangeness.

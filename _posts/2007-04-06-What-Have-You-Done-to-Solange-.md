I tracked this down because of its reputation as a very complex mystery. I tolerated the bad production values, the odd dubbing, the gratuitous nudity and the misogynistic violence because of the promise of cleverness. If you are coming to this for the same reason, don't bother.

Yes, it has a murderer and a motive not apparent in the beginning. No, the solution is not clever. No, it is not constructed so that you slap your forehead because you could have known. No, the ending doesn't make any sense except in the most artificial of worlds, worlds in which secret sex clubs exist. Yess, it has a score by Morricone, but in one of his sleeping moments. And you will get frustrated at the "vision" of the initial witness.

The only interesting thing to say is that it is Italian made and set in London; the main character is Italian. Its mildly interesting to see how Italians see themselves as discriminated against and after proved worthy how they become the smartest and most earnest guys around.

Spoilers herein.

I continue to advocate for watching failed films -- like this one -- because they often have something to offer. You put those good bits together with those from other films and you have masterpieces. For me, much of the impact of film is in memory rather than that brief dark period of exhibition. The real influence on my life and imagination comes from these memories and it is a small task to assemble my own film from experiences.

For instance: 'Attic Expeditious' had a terrific story, '13 Ghosts' a pretty cool notion of environment as mechanical demigod, 'Dark City' was visually self-referential, and this turkey has some haunting cinematography. Yes, it is poorly written, yes, the acting is off kilter, yes it doesn't engage. So what? This is just a very, very bad film in a vast heap of bad films.

'The Ring' (US version) worked for me largely because of the self-reference, like 'Cut.' Here was a film about films that kill. Transferring the notion to a website, which isn't passive and narrative is where the primary flaw is, I think. Until we have the 'Tulse Luper' websites, and if they live up to the promise, we just won't have websites of narrative, visual power.

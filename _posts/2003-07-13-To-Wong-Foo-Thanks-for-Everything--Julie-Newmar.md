Spoilers herein.

I continue to be amazed at films that portray risktaking but that take no risks  themselves.

The genre this time around is the 'Music Man' type: strangers end up in town somehow  and end up with mutual endearment. Usually it is bank robbers ('Trapped in Paradise,'  'Happy Texas'). Here it is drag queens. But their queenness, though often mentioned,  doesn't figure much in the story. What's the star here is the sort of honest wisdom that  Whoopie Goldberg often bludgeons us with.

Too bad. Film is inherently a bunch of folks dressing up and finding characters within. So  when you make a film about guys dressing up TO find characters within, there is  inherent potential for something interesting. But you have to be edgy, take risks and be  intelligent. None of that here - this targets a sweet comedy, more 'Like It Hot' than  'Priscilla.' Except for the unfulfilled promise of the reference: a mopvie about a  photograph.

Would be a complete waste of time were it not for three actors trying hard. All are  serious folks: John Leguiziamo, Blythe Danner and Melinda Dillon. There's a little bit of  Latrec in John's work and a little bit of redheaded otherworldliness in Melinda's. Blythe  has the self-referential duties here: a film character obsessed with film characters. She  was obviously intended to be the fulcrum for matters of identity, bleached out by test  audiences and meek funders.

Sydney Pollack drives me a bit crazy. I like his ideas, when he has them. I like his approach to cinema as cinema first, story second and acting as support. I'm particularly fond of his ambitions in this film, especially the urgencies; life, context, camera.

But it all seems a waste because he never has enough confidence -- in any of his films -- to matter. He's terrific at the engagement part, and then while he has us captivated, we simply discover that he has nothing to say. It isn't the greatest sin, or is it? We only have so many episodes in life that could matter; why waste them on mere Uncle Remus tales?

You'll find this has two engaging things apart from the assembly. One is the intermingling of the camera in the contest, and particularly in the periodic races the dancers have to go through. This was in an era when this effort was both rare and risky. It matters though it seems tame today.

The other is that there are a couple of terrific actresses, at near their peak. I prefer York of the pair. Its a more nuanced character, and the microhesitations seem perfect. We really care what happens to her. Fonda shines also, but all she has to do is spit.

If that's enough for you, you'll find this an interesting visit to a bold Hollywood experiment.

I'm trying to understand "Memento" like narrative folds, where the characters are shuffled in time -- the story itself broken up in addition to the telling of the story.

Here, the "telling" of the story is pretty straightforward, following a fellow as things happen to him. The film time is his experience time. He travels back in time by happenstance caused by himself. Unlike "Primer" it is extremely easy to know at each moment what is happening. There is one twist, but it is a conventional movie twist not connected to the time travel. It is based on a deception that we had seen just before.

You wonder why to introduce this disruptive plot device, if you aren't going to do something that takes advantage of it, why go to the trouble? 

I have to admit that this is well enough done in the basic values. But it feels a lot like a "Twilight Zone" episode.

This is a serious complaint. "Twilight Zone" was one of four or five contemporary experiments in short story. They are designed around one narrative turn, one simple knot: he buys her a brush just as she buys a watch chain. These things can amuse. They can divert. I am convinced that they can do no more than that. For real soulmoving you need the long form, you need to find a vein.

Its too bad. This is well enough written, including the expectation of seeing a young woman's breasts because we saw the same scene before unexpectedly and know it is coming again. But it simply doesn't matter.

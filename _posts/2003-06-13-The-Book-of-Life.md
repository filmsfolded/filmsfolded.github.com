Spoilers herein.

Hartley is a different kind of film experience for me. Usually, one can just receive, which  of course depends on there being something WORTH receiving. Sometimes (often in fact)  there is a sort of dialog between filmmaker (and/or actor) and viewer, but that is almost  always a matter of the story itself and how it is presented.

Hartley enters into a different kind of dialog: we have to invent almost everything in the  experience, while he spends most of his time challenging how we go about it.

I haven't seen many, only "No Such Thing" and this. "Thing" was a tough, exhilarating  challenge, with ideas so novel even the notion of playing on that ground was unfamiliar.  But this lacks that spirit. Here we play in an area where all vegetation, all life has been  pounded flat by countless examinations of "religion." The level of THIS game is  somewhere around that of the "Silver Surfer," not trivial, but not novel either.

But it is still a good game because of the method: especially the women. They are all that  matter, and it is plain that this man loves women and loves to invent them and live in  that invented aura.

"Do you want soup with that" on west 28th Street. That will stick in my mind for a very  long time.

An absolutely side issue: we really ARE engaged in a minor skirmish between the forces  of good and evil for influence over freedom in our imagination. Part of that battle is this  film itself, which exercises some small degree of freedom from the machine. Part is the  role played by Apple in the computer space, on much the same turf. The PowerBook as a  character more powerful than Beelzebub, controlled by Mr and Mrs DW Griffith. What a  gas.

I?m really impressed with the voice casting. Most of the abstraction comes from talking,  and the selection of tones is hypnotic. Polly Jane. The best I've heard since Jarman's  Tempest featured Toyah Willcox.

Ted?s Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.

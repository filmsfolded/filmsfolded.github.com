Spoilers herein.

One of the most interesting features of films is how they can ferret out the touchstones of culture and leverage them to great effect. Usually, it is the superficial Spielberg type of manipulation that makes you feel a little dirty on leaving the theater, for having had strings pulled for such cheap, mercenary purpose. 

But sometimes the touchstones are so deep you welcome them in. I felt this way with 'Men.' I think that's because the values in this story are so unequivacally, well, honorable. Rarely would I recommend a film on these terms, but I do so here.

Another fascinating element of the film experience is that it is a community experience. Other performances are as well, but this is the only non-live medium that collects people in a dark room for a shared experience all across the country. Most films produce a peripheral awareness of the collective response, often at an emotional level.

I live in the Norfolk Virginia area, home of the largest concentration of military bases in the world. The audiences are always full of military and their family, no matter what. So when the films are about Navy fliers or submarines and such, this audience is special. First, they spot every technical goof. Second, they take to heart the notions of honor and duty these films often project.

I'm no jingoist. But it is special seeing this in Carl Brashear's home town in a theater only a couple miles from where he lives -- from where the Hoist is stationed. (I understand there is always a ship of that name.) Although the Sunday character is a composite, everyone here knows the story. Everyone appreciates that the challenges were racist, but that the response was one of personal courage not victimhood. Stands a far cry from 'Remember the Titans,' also a true story, but more an apology for urban black culture, along the lines of a dozen films just this year. I'll take this any day.

Spoilers herein.

Some of these junky old films turn into masterpieces after a time. That's because we gladly overlook the gaudiness and focus on the idea. And what a great idea this is.

An actor playing an actor playing all the great Shakespearean roles. They are twisted only a small bit.

Film itself -- much of it -- is a tussle between what actors would do and the larger vision. The joke here is the desecration of Shakespeare that the British stage has foisted on us in the last century: the conceit that he is all about actors instead of something larger. it quite literally murders what it means to be human. 

The silent movie scenes in the beginning underscore that this understanding is the basis of the film: Shakespeare bereft of even the words. The first scene after that is the film proper: a shot of a van with the words: 'Shakespeare's Removers.' The audience consists of something identified as 'meths drinker' (a Britishism that I assume means a drinker of methanol). It surely means near-lobotomizers.

This film has a special treat for me as I am an enthusiast of Alice in Wonderland as much as Shakespeare. Here we have Coral Brown who would go on to become both Mrs Price and the famous Alice.

There are only so many ways to cinematically tell a story, so when we see one that seems new, it charms. The overall value may be worthless -- I think this is -- but the manner of telling has charm.

What we have is a camera tethered to a man, who I guess is in his mid-thirties. There isn't frame that doesn't include him somehow. The camera watches him obsessively: his hands, neck, back. No motion or stance is too minor to evade the lingering camera. No strange behavior or any behavior at all escapes.

Meanwhile he is a furtive obsessive. He is a carpentry instructor. One should probably say trainer as he drills his teen students on minute movements for each task. He is obsessive in his own life, doing things with exaggerated precision. In another context, we may cry foul because of actorly overshowing. But the "showing" seems genuinely rooted in the character.

We encounter him in a particularly furtive effort. We don't know what the episode involves until later, but it seems to involve a new boy.

He peers. He sneaks, he spies and is remote. We eventually discover why -- a haunting event from five years prior.

Now here's the trick. While we watch him with obsession, the entire film from beginning to end and beyond, is about his watching this boy. While he discovers and accepts this boy in his life, we do the same for him. Its classic folding: as we see him open, we subconsciously do.

Unfortunately, we are left with thin rewards for opening our hearts. Because in the end, his character is defined to be valuable for the storytelling method, not the story itself. He doesn't matter.

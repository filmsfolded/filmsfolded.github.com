I don't see many theater movies these days. When I went to "Casino Royale," I was very impressed with the opening chase, not just the amazing physicality of it, but the way it was captured cinegraphically. Doing a bit of research turns up what you probably know, that this is the street art of parkour, adapted to film.

It was one of the most exciting things I've seen. 

Not only was it new in terms of film vocabulary but I think it was fresh because it is still a genuine street phenomenon. Reminded me of "Rize," something my best friend recommended. That led me to this film, which has been on my list for a while. Only about a quarter of the action scenes are parkour; the rest are ordinary action dross. And the parkour isn't handled with grace visually. But its still exciting.

This movie was on my list for two reasons. The second one was Dany Verissimo. Islamic porn is one of the strange corners of the film world, extremely formulaic but very nuanced, very dynamic both as porn and film. Within that genre, most is made in the west for a mostly Arabic audience, the most popular being made in Paris targeting Egypt and using immigrant girls. Verissimo was for a brief while the star of that heaven and because that market is so focused, she was a star indeed.

(She's from Madagascar instead of Egypt, but that hardly matters.)

The role of the captured sister here was written just for her by writer, producer, funder Besson, because she's a sort of token. Someone whose presence means something, that references an external, but still film-centered fantasy. Its impossible for this American to fully appreciate the role of race, exotic sexuality and class in France. But surely her inclusion here was meant to tickle it.

Films are not like food. With food, you can move from competent chef to chef and happily taste whatever they concoct. Among the many different kinds of good meals you may encounter, you can simply enjoy the variety.

Film is different. Film nourishes the imagination and building a life with film involves carefully choosing which films to absorb and which ones demand bulimia. Here we have a film made by someone very much in control of what we see. It is deeply coherent. Small things spin into larger ones; for instance near the very beginning Liz taunts the hunk by noting that Texas is a fiction. She then proceeds to enter that fiction. 

Moreover, this is essential viewing if you want to see Malick's "Days of Heaven," which borrows the key notion of the sex players and the house alone. And there _is_ some importance to the director: after all, he invented some now common techniques, and led the charge for film as art.

But his mind is not as deep as his ability to speak, so there isn't much real depth to this. It doesn't actually _say_ anything useful, doesn't think in new ways, doesn't transport. Instead of a cathedral we have an expertly done shopping mall. 

That's a shame because the way he has constructed this film, we aren't watching the story but his vision of the story. The thing isn't rooted in what we see, but in what he sees. He is between us and the characters. So there needs to be a brilliant mind behind the eye and it just isn't there. In fact, he's as dull and flat as the characters we see. His world view is as solid as Rock's.

But this project is usually celebrated not for its coherence, or depth but for Dean's performance, and here the competing philosophies are more clear. Dean is intense. He's obviously trying hard. Does he inhabit the character like Streep does? Does he inhabit the space between the character and us like Brando does?

No, he inhabits the actor.

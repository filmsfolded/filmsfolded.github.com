This has a very clumsy ending, but we hardly notice because there isn't much to end. It is a series of linked vignettes, each seemingly written independent of the others. It steers randomly this way and that as if the stupor of Withnail were the guiding consciousness.

(If you see the documentary on the DVD you will see that this is so.)

The more I think about "Sideways" the less I think of it. Initially, I marveled at its almost perfect structure. It is so well shaped that the structure of the thing is what carries it. But all that structure is from the current playbook: the external reflection, the rule of twos, the law of ironic noir.

But the more time you spend with it, the more sterile it seems because that structure is so perfect. Here's the antidote: essentially the same story except no women and no shape at all. Everything is in the texture of the thing. 

The accompanying documentary says this is poorly shot, but I think not. It looks like "Barry Lyndon" to me, without the gloss. There is literally tons of atmosphere: fog, rain, smoke, dew and just filth in the air.

It has the tone of "The Dresser" in terms of being actors about acting and tragically so. It has a disembodied noir tone that reflects the dreary state of the sixties in London, quite a bit more defeatist than in the states at that time. It uses music in a more internally integrated way than any other piece of the period.

And most of all, it has a huge number of memorable lines. It has a cult status in Britain, which is good, but sadly all that seems to come from the quotable dialog rather than the cinematic aptness, and this is a very bad thing indeed.

The ending is inept as I say, but it hardly matters because there is no arc to resolve. It is a collection of arcs, scoped small, just as the lives depicted would be.

I suggest you watch this and then see "In Dreams." Sheds a whole new light on that difficult to appreciate project.

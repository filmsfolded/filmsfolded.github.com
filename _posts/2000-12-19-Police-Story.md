One of the most interesting problems in cinema is how to film dance. Dance is purely visual and relates directly to the emotions. But it differs from cinema, being at once more abstract and human. I know of no fully successful film about dance, despite the expected enormous payoff.

But in elaborate fight films we have an interesting solution. Add violence and make some of the movements so clearly and 'really' dangerous they amaze. It works, at least as well as other dance attempts, largely because violence is now one of the fundamental cinematic links with the mental underworld.

Jackie Chan is among the best of these 'dancers,' and here is at his most effective. Unlike Bruce Lee, who applied a patina of religion to his ballet, Chan has cultivated a notion of self-deprecating humor.

The problem is in the filming. The best dance solutions engage the film as a participant, moving and weaving as part of the choreography. But the framing here (directed by Jackie) is typically static. Will the innovations of 'The Matrix' lead to a choreographed camera as this genre evolves?

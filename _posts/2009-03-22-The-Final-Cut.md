I watched this with another, supposedly failed independent film "American Strays." Both seemed successful to me.

Its almost never the perfection of production values or the fact that the story is neatly explored that matters to me. Its whether the thing affixes, whether it twists and evolves something I have.

The story has two threads.

One is a thriller-formatted version of the traditional noir form, average guy finds himself arbitrarily manipulated by forces connected to the existence of an audience. That thread is wound around an intensely folded device that has the audience in the film, watchers of POV films of complete lives. An annotation within this thread indulges in a new wave observation of how narrative bends reality. 

I find all of that remarkably successful, including the usual but in this case unexpected end where we discover that everything we have seen is "rememoried." The usually vapid Williams is entirely right here. Because of his Rainbow Randolph, I can forgive several Sean Maguires. In this case, though, he really pins it. I attribute that to decades of image- centric psychotherapy, where the patient is asked to recall things cinematically.

If you have not seen this, the setup is that by unimportant means people's lives are captured as POV films. The films, capture "truth." After death, a filmmaker modifies that truth by selection so that the memory of the individual is pleasantly colored. The filmmaker of focus, Williams, is particularly good at this bending. Because of a childhood trauma, he adopts the posture of retroactive therapist, a "sin eater," purifying his characters.

He finds that he unexpectedly has one of these internal cameras installed and both freaks out as a result and illicitly uses the recall to re-remember the trauma, discovering that the filmed version differs from his memory, the filmed version releasing him from guilt. But at the very end, we discover that whet we have seen in the re-remembered version could have been changed by the Caviziel character. This, we know because the final scene is a transition from the POV of the recording to the fourth wall of the noir viewer.

Pretty effective. Pretty intelligent. Pretty cinematic.

Look, the man is an artist. His job is to understand the limits what can be done while at  the same time embossing the world with his own shape.

This is trivial, heavy. That's because he works with cinematic reduction. He knows how to  work with sex, at least facial sex which is the movie version. The most common  cinematic reductions include violence. And he tries that. But it it already so abstract there  is no room for another Hartley layer.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.

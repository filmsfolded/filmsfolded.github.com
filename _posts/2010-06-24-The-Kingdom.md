When I watch these things, there are two of me. One is there for the immersive experience an thrills, cries and laughs more or less as intended, me at the center of a target demographic. Next to me and bothering me is someone there who watches not what the thing says/shows but how the movie says/shows it. Sometimes it is the second me that is thrilled while the ordinary moviegoer growls. 

This movie did not work for me, form many of the same reasons it did not work for others. It wasn't enough in any of the dimensions that it was.

But I was thrilled at the risk that the filmmaker took. There is a formula in action movies that has action more or less sprinkled through the thing, punctuated by non-action scenes that are just filler. Into this you can insert small narrative bits that explain why all the noise and sparkle happens.

This is a different model. After one scene at the beginning that is associated with the titles and narrative introduction, we have one long narrative film with no real action, followed by what seems the end of the movie. Then we have one rather long and intense action scene. The format is unknown in my experience, and must have been quite a risk for the studio.

If you look at how they addressed this, it is pretty clever. The dialog, the actual words, are very, very snappy, much better written than anything I have seen recently. Anything. The story as a narrative is bankrupt, but the lines are great, just great. Chris Cooper is brought on board precisely because he is one of the best in the business at delivering these ten second gems. He is great here. Think of any other blockbuster investment where they made such a decision.

And by the standards that apply, the action sequence is good, starting off with a bang. By itself, it had a narrative structure, a rich one having to do with family and parenting (while a beheading takes place in the next apartment). Not only is the structure here rich absolutely, but it is comparatively rich. It took some work to do that. Most action sequences are just situations, typically escape.

So the guy next to me was trilled. He noted that cinematically the action bits were ordinary, but narratively they were rare and good, to be celebrated and savored. But me? Not a great movie.

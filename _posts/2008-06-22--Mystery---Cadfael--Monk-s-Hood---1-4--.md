TeeVee mysteries captivate me, because there I such a wide variety. Some are very clever and understand what works. Some are amazingly daft about the charms of mystery, or even engaging narrative. Often, they try to get by with simple scenery.

That's how the book series is set up: the mysteries are thin, and the description of the medieval context is rich. It obviously worked for the readers. It works less well in the TeeVee version. I think its because we are so used to seeing sets and costumes like these. They give us absolutely nothing from the era that is not delivered by sets. But in any case, to have an effective film, you need the richest narrative you can deliver. 

And they just do not here. Having a sometime great actor is a waste unless you give him something to do. 

The episode I viewed was this one. According to the scriptwriter's playbook, you need one main driving story, here the murder. You need a second story that complicates the first. Here it is about a temporary petty tyrant at the monastery, and his corresponding inept substitute in the sheriff's office. And you need a backstory. In this case, the new widow is the detective's lost fianc√© from the past.

Its all so mechanical, almost cathecatical. This episode was a waste and the whole series looks bankrupt.

Spoilers herein.

What a disaster! The Marxes filled the camera from edge to edge with disorder -- that's  the gift they gave us. What a sad thing then, to experience a documentary that is shaped  in a way that is contrary to everything they worked for.

This is the story through the eyes of a Fenneman/Dumont, their spoiled dumb kids and  various fawning but uninspired admirers -- it demeans.

The only interesting part is the Cosby bit. He understood and winks appreciation to us  while an aged Groucho does his thing.

You might want to pair this film with "Dogtown and the Z-Boys." That is a documentary  about a media phenomenon done in the style of the phenomenon. Highlights the

inadequacy of this.

I believe that humor is something like music: it is invented. Great musicians do not find  music, they invent it. The Marxes invented one thread of film humor. There may be only  three or four. They not only made us laugh, they discovered new ways to make us laugh.  More than half of all my laughs come from something they invented. What could be a  better legacy?

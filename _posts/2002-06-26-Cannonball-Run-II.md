Spoilers herein.

Wonder why we don't see this formula more? We had 'Mad, Mad World,' and the recent 'Rat Race.' There was also a cartoon series 'Wacky Racers,' but other than that nothing I recall. So although the formula is well defined and apparently successful, it is way down on the list of most-selected templates.

Strange. Because it has worked. One of the advantages of the form is that lots of personalities are involved in small scenes, so there are lots of opportunities to register a laugh. It only takes a few successful touchstones to satisfy the audience and most viewers forget the nonfunny parts.

Just wondering. 

There's a simple self-referential trick here: most teams devise a skit to fool the police. Lots of little plays-within-the play.

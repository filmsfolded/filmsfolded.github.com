Spoilers herein.

The idea is simple. Films are the most hypnotizing art. The intent of a certain type of actor (and the writer who supports him) is to draw the viewer in through leading-by-following. You always go where the viewer's mind anticipates. You make the channel and the water flows on its own. Like the mail, whose symbolism is a bit heavy here.

This is a particular approach to cinematic narrative, not one I like so much -- I like to be tricked into places I wouldn't go and suddenly become made aware of it. But when the waterflow technique is as skillfully employed as it is here, I have to marvel. It takes more than intuition to pull this off.

The way this is done here is by reflection -- Wilson plays not to us but to his partners. He draws a channel and they anticipate. He is such a focus that we are drawn in like the rest of the ensemble. He opens, they walk in. To make it even more effective, we are given some imaginary, active chorus characters that are halfway between the real ensemble and us: first two guy cops and then the woman cop (surrogate of the lost daughter) takes over the case. They (that part of we) are more skeptical but still willing coconspirators.

The key to making this work as well as it does in my mind is Garofalo. She really has a hard job. Wilson has to simply appear to be open; Garofalo has to define gravity, establish the laws of Wilson's universe. In a few simple moves, she defines the world as a system of social incompetences, of intents never realized, of conversations always hung, of sex always imagined (of undelivered mail -- both messages and male). She eagerly grasps failure, while fearing the next breath. 

She's done this reflective bit with Stiller before, but always (in my experience) in an ironic framework. This is a twist, completely without irony -- a character with no guile. Not easy I would imagine. She is definitely on my list to follow wherever she goes.

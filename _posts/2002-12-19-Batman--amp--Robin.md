Spoilers herein.

I've developed a hobby of sorts: following movie franchises as they change. The most interesting has been Alien as different directors have imparted entirely different film philosophies to roughly the same outline. Fascinating.

The four Batmen showed promise at first, because Burton is an intelligent fellow with a specific world in mind. And unlike most comicbook sources, the Batman story has some interesting depth built into it: the superhero as a dark curse with pathological overtones.

We have two Burton films and now two Schumacher ones. The first worked on the built space and didn't quite succeed. The second did succeed in creating not only an effective world but several. In fact, each of the main characters had two worlds: Batman had the mansion and the cave, reflecting entirely different designs: not just differences in style but different physics. So too with Penguin and catwoman. Brilliant actually.

Then along comes Schumacher who understands design inexpertly. He works on ONE world, putting the dualities into the characters, like two-face. This was a less satisfying result. The characters were slightly more attractive, but the world became just a collection of incoherent colors and shapes. And now we have the final evolution of that trend. 

This time out, there is even less attention given to creating an alternative universe for our minds to enter. The way this works and appears makes no sense. Where 'Forever' worked too hard to create subworlds that almost made too much sense, we have the opposite here. So what we end up with is something like an old Sid Caesar skit where the set doesn't matter: we know exactly who the stars are and expect them to shift between their real personalities and that of the cartoon they play. The joke is in how outrageous each person can be: it has nothing to do with any story or world.

That's why this fails. The only remotely interesting characters (by design) are Arnie and Uma. But Arnie's real person is a cartoon, and impossible to spoof. Its a catch 22: we expect such players to poke fun at themselves. Its more fun when they are dumb, but it requires them to be smart in order to do so. Woody Allen knows how to do this. With Arnie, he's just dumb.

Uma is something else. She got put on the map by Gilliam's Munchausen, where she made the same labially-parted entrance she does here. She then worked on very literary ('June') and fabricated ('Liaisons') self-aware sexuality and was already by 'Pulp Fiction' referring to her past roles. She IS smart enough to play with us in this film, but interestingly the very past she mines works against her. She really is a plain woman whose 'beauty' is invented. Michelle (and her double) could act with their bodies, in a parody of sexual motion. Uma knows how to pose, but not how to move: she acts with her mouth only, a real restriction.

Think of this from the perspective of poor Alfred. His job is to keep the physical world well ordered and functional. He does so with both the mansion and the cave. In the Burton films, he actually stands for Burton. In these Schumacher films, he all but dies.

Oh well, at least we have the memorable exterior of Arkham Asylum.

Regular readers of my comments know I am interested in narrative devices that I call "folding." Sometimes it must seem a stretch, but if ever there was an obviously engineered example, here it is.

The spine of the thing is your standard romantic comedy formula. Guy loves girl. Guy loses girl, usually through a misunderstanding. Guy gets girl back at the end, usually involving a statement of love in front of an audience.

One twist is that this has an image of a spine used in another genre: Guy has misplaced values. Guy is tested in an unlikely, noirish way. Guy is redeemed at the end by finding "the true meaning of life." The specific variant has an outsider that enters the guy's life, a stranger. The formula requires that this stranger exemplifies natural wisdom. This used to be an "aw-shucks" sort of guy. In the modern political environment, actual stupidity and denial of reality qualifies.

The second spine is folded into the first, which is easy. They don't conflict at all until the end where have the redemption coopting the scene with the on-screen audience and the rejoining of the lovers happens in a second ending empowered by inner folds.

As with the spines, these explicit folds are two. One is the "perfomance" within that the title references: an audience invites the dumb to a dinner and awards a prize for the most entertaining stupidity. This is a traditional fold of the play-within-a-play sort. 

The second fold involves the wise stranger. He makes dioramas of preserved mice in costumes. This must have been a challenge to the writers because they pulled the biggest guns we know: John Lennon (when his 70th birthday re-awakens his memory). The valuable establishing few minutes at the beginning of the film are spent letting us know that Lennon's wisdom/idealism is to be related to these mouse-scenes. Because it is the first we see, it is the moral core of the world of the film.

This inner fold of the dioramas is merged with the inner fold of the dinner performance. A temporary weld is written in, involving imagined mind control. 

I don't suppose the writer diagrammed this structure; it likely was envisioned intuitively from attunement with where the public is going. But I can guarantee that the producers did, and also that they added the Lennon and mind control elements to bind the mix. This is because we as the viewing public appreciate these complex narrative structures. We also appreciate irony that is placed a half step ahead of the mainstream. 

As I write this, that mainstream irony (stupidity as truth) is fueled by the Fox News empire and defined as comic irony by John Stewart of comedy central. Lest you think this isn't engineered to the finest degree, at the dinner is a blind swordfighter, who cuts off the finger of an obsolete aristocrat. Both are carefully designed to fit stereotypes devised by both sides in the polarized public.

The appeal of this film will fade as our notions of irony and narrative folding evolve, but for now it hits a sweet spot.

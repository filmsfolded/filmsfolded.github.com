Spoilers herein.

Yet another project with bamboo thin scaffolding to support Carrey's version of Jerry  Lewis. The problem is that Jerry had a character that he carried from film to film, like  Chaplin's tramp. So you knew who you would see and how he would act. The story was  just a vehicle. Jerry lived outside the story. 

Carrey on the other hand does more or less the same stuff every film, but the character is  always within the story. When the humor of the story has to support the humor of the  character, you're in trouble unless you have a good idea. And it has to be better than  being God, or a mean cable guy or a multiple personality. I do admit that he isn't a bad  actor when he chooses projects intended to be intelligent, like 'Truman' and 'Majestic'  and 'Moon.' 

But then he isn't great in those layered projects either. I haven't yet seen his latest  serious project. Kate can really help someone who tries, and Carrey does try and he is  smart enough to know smart film ideas.

But not here. Here its just jackanapes.

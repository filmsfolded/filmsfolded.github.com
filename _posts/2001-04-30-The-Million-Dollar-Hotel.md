Spoilers herein.

This is some very risky stuff. For once, we have a camera perspective and directoral stance that mirrors the story. We've had collections of wierdos and madmen before, but you can't get more engaged than this, by having part of your own frontal lobes compromised..

Very fine collaborative acting in the theater tradition, including Milla! (Will she get better?) Except for Mel, who deliberately acts like an actor here. I thought I would never forgive Mel for the travesty of 'The Patriot.' But he gets some ground back here in my book, taking (partly) as big a risk as the rest of the crew. This and 'Payback' show that he isn't going to rot willingly. But as I understand he disavowed the film after release, he loses many points.

This director knows a thing or two about about syncopating the framerate. Some of his visual blues riffs of speeding and slowing made my heart stop, beginning with the first scenes of meeting Eloise. So much of the framing and lighting was evocative of Tom Tom's last brief appreciation of life. Just watching it makes me glad to be here.

This would have worked for me with just the directing/photography and the acting. I'm a little puzzled about the script, and I admit it is because I assume Bono is a nitwit, to judge from his lyrics. It IS pushing the cleverness envelope, especially the John Lennon bit. That part didn't integrate with anything else -- it pointed only outside the film to Bono. But all the other stuff about Skinner's third arm and the tar covering masterpieces and the varied references to freaks are aptly self-parody. Clearly the director felt that way. ('Its all so much TeeVee.')

I wasn't prepared for Davies. I'd only seen him in 'Ryan,' 'Twister,' and 'Up at the Villa.' and though he was servicable, the taint of those films stuck a little I guess. He is very good here, with his attention shifts very much in the same rhythm of the director's punctuations. I wonder what vocabulary they used to coordinate that?

See this if you love the cinema part of cinema.

I'm convinced that some of the most imaginative scriptwriting is in the most unlikely places: kids movies, porn, what have you. And I found some of that in the first Scooby movie.

Here's the deal. The cartoon had the same plot for a gazillion years: kids investigate ghost and find it is a human in disguise, sort of a kiddie Baskerville. Now along came the movie and instead of humans in ghost costumes, we had ghosts in humans. And the story rolled with it: all sorts of gags based on different notions of self-reference. It was perfectly right for the project, which after all puts humans in cartoon figures and with the dog, a cartoon figure among humans.

I liked it. It played with the nature of film. Velma's hair was cast as dark red, so both the girls were redheads. This was a cinematic decision. No fools in charge that time.

Now this. The story this time could have been taken to the next level. It certainly seems to have been conceived that way from the basic idea: you start with a collection of costumes from all the old cartoons. These are the costumes that humans wore, pretending to be ghosts. Now you have real ghosts wear those costumes. Has promise.

Also take our Velma out of her costume. (Since the first Scooby, we've seen Cardinelli in "Brokeback Mountain." In that, she played the 21 year old daughter to a fifty-something Ledger, though she is quite a but older. It reminds us that 30 year olds are playing these teenagers.) Anyway, take Velma out of her dorky costume (but keeping the fake teeth) and into something sexy. Part of the joke about costumes. And there's some minor play with Shag and the Dog transforming too. All this indicates that it got started as intelligently as before, but in development someone must have wanted it to be more like the cartoons. This means you're mostly just looking scared and running away in comic fashion.

Velma's hair is black. That should have been the giveaway. Where is Rodriguez when we need him? This is a waste. But I'm going to keep coming back. Maybe next time someone will want it "like the first one," which after all did double the business.

Spoilers herein.

Finally, a consistent project where the manner of the film matches the matter of the  story.

This story is about an incompetent plot to put an appealing girl in front of the masses in  the midst of certain pomp and flush. And it is that same thing.

I suppose it is nothing unusual to see an actress who has done good work be immature  in an early outing.

But here's something more interesting: the director was king of the royal Shakespeare  Company for two decades. This was a time of significant wisdom and insight into drama  in reshaping the philosophy of the organization. 

And it isn't as if he didn't have a good crew: he enlisted England's most respected  cinematographer and editor and was able to wrangle a decent budget. So why didn't  anyone clue him into the fact that films are different? - that they require an energy that  moves: in the story of course, in the presentation and in the sweep of the characters.

None of this is here. Even the sets don't register.

Why would no one say anything? Was this a vanity project?

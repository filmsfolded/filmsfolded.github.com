There are only a few films that can be called roots. 1968 generated two of them, '2001' and this. 

'2001' is about the ambiguities of who is narrating. This is about the ambiguities of where the skin is. From the very beginning, the prurient peeling of the spacesuit, to the marvelous suits she wears (with translucency and fake breasts and tummies), even to the orgasmic organ, and the psychic sex. The feeling by the blind man, and the people lost in the labyrinth who either develop holes or merge with the rocks.

Identity is all about skin, here depicted as sex. Because it is cinematic. This is Jane Fonda's first project in layered acting. She would never reach the level of Brando, Penn, and the three women we have now. But she wasn't the ding bat she portrays, something you can tell from the very odd controlled inflections.

There's even an inkling of some 60's ideas at the end, where the two poles of woman are saved because the angel has no memory.

Incidentally, this was a thirty year old woman, newly pregnant and bulimic. Pretty amazing to do this.

If you wish to understand science fiction, this is one of the movies you must see.

Spoilers herein.

There's a movie by the name of 'Robot Monster,' one of IMDBs worst-rated films ever. It is juvenile, with incredibly bad production values. However, the whole thing is framed as a the 'dream' of a juvenile. In this context, everything makes a kind of sense.

This is the same. It lacks any imagination, just grabbing a few routines here and there from porn and gore movies. It is so bad that it even lacks a fan base. Now imagine that, given what tripe the porn and gore community celebrate.

But it is framed as the psychotropic vision of a troubled girl on being committed. What you see is very like what a person with limited imagination would presume that a similar person would be hallucinating. Perfect in a sense, even if unwatchable.

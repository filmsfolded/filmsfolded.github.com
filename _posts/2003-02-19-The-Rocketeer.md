Spoilers herein.

Nearly all films are about other films. This one is more explicit than most: is about films of the thirties. Instead of characters per se, we have genres as characters: the gangster genre, the scifi genre, the fighter pilot genre, and the spy film. Along the way, certain of these have avatars, especially the characters of Errol Flynn and Howard Hughes (himself a filmmaker during this period). No one knows how to engineer metacharacters like Disney. Too bad they felt like they had to deliver a story, because the other side of Disney doesn't understand all this meta-stuff. They take story very seriously and tried to deliver. 

Two warring factions keep this from working.

There's incidentally a way cool Spruce Goose reference.

Jennifer does here what she did for 'Beautiful Mind:' simply react.

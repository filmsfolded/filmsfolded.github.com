Spoilers herein.

DeVito annoys me because he is so smart, and when he does something this stupid its just a waste.

We know he's smart because of 'Throw Momma' which merged the shifting reflection of Nabokov with the mixed narrative of Hitchcock. No, I'm not joking, and the depth of the preceding sentence reflects the sophistication of thought in that little project. But DeVito is also lazy too. I suppose it is from his TeeVee days where he learned that viewers will swallow almost everything if you make the label plain enough. In 'Taxi,' the jokes were terrible, but people laughed when the sign clicked on. Here, he believes that Dahl's meanness will be taken as charming if he tells us to.

This is one thing in children's books and another in film. In kiddielitterature, the very notion of mean darkness was part of the conspiracy of gremlins and children against adults. In film -- at least this kind of film -- the adults are asked to conspire against ourselves by being brought into the collaboration. Well, I suppose some can be duped; many people laughed at 'Taxi.' But this is far, far beneath the cleverness and skills of DeVito. Shame on us for letting him be lazy.

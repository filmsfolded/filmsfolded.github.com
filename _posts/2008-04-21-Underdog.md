There's a trend in current movies, a positive one I believe.

The idea is to take a film clich√© normally considered admirable, or heroic and to turn it on its head. This works best when you deviate from your home genre a bit, while staying close enough so that the viewer can chuckle at the twist. The idea here is superheros. No one can quite top the Macey's the shoveler, but here the idea is to twist it toward another sacred being: the cute dog.

That's the whole joke folks. Everything else is padding. We do tolerate that in other versions, but at least there the padding has something going on to keep us occupied. For instance Leone's westerns were based on a similar idea, but everything we see held us. 

Not so here.

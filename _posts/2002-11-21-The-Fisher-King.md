Spoilers herein.

We have two battling worlds here -- neither one wins. We have the world of the writer who has certain tricks he pulled from the stock book: the self-reference of an actor playing a nested, created role: the merger of the two realities (of the film and the reality within the film), the incongruously unsexy redhead, the reflection of the video store, the (film) performer who plays a (radio) performer and who is offered a (TeeVee) performance about something that sounds very much like this film.

And we have the world of the filmmaker, Gilliam. This world is highly architectural; quirkily strewn with odd objects; always has a menacing corporate overlord; and is populated by people coping through good humor. Quite a different world. Each is incompatible with the other because both are self-defining. These worlds tussle within the small bag that is this film and the result is incoherent. It is not a matter of left and right brain -- it is a matter of the liver engaged in a life and death struggle with the kidneys. Fortunately for us, we have Roger Pratt's use of space wrapping it which makes the whole thing tolerable if you notice the architectural eye.

This struggle is interestingly mirrored in the story, in the two characters. Bridges is Gilliam's character, an open actor who acts with his frame. Bridges occupies space; all the shots of him emphasize the space around him and his relationship to it. His relationship with show 'business' is similarly multilayered and overlain on the space. He is selfishly indulgent and loved for it. That's Gilliam. Watch how Jeff emulates his walk.

On the other hand, we have Williams. He is surrogate for the writer, and is a superficial student of myth, intent on acting it out. He doesn't know better, presenting the known as if it were deeply true. Watch how meanspirited is Gilliam's camera in how it treats Parry. Watch how Robin is clueless about how he is being abused.

The self-reference of the battle over the film and the battle within the film is interesting enough. Bridges would be tapped by the Coens to do this very same thing against Julianne Moore in 'Lebowski.' But for Williams, this turns out to be just another of his many roles as aggrieved widower, this time with the comatose bit as well.

Gilliam himself would eventually find the kind of film that he is perfectly suited for: 'Fear and Loathing.' The irony is that at that point, he learns not to fight the broken mind of the writer, but to enter it and populate it with his signature elements: space, stuff, oppression, salvation through irony.

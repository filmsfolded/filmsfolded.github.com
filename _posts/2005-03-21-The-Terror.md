I'm spending a lot of time with 1930's mysteries. This one just isn't worth your time. It has some interesting plot features: the double-blind villain and a double-blind detective. But it has some tedious elements: the spooky mansion with secret doors, the hooded villain, carefully shrouded until the end, too much talk among and to "inspectors," and the not very funny comic relief in the biddy who thinks she knows all. And it spends an inordinate percentage of our patience on the setup and prior events.

You'll guess all the secrets as soon as they are posed.

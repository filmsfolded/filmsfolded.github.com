Spoilers herein.

French films, even artificially French ones like this, compress all their depth and simplicity of  reading together. So that after the first few it becomes so boring you need to invent your  own depth. In this case, we are helped a little. The Italian and the fires and the sex and all  that is imagined.

Moreau knows this and adds some ambiguity to the dark world. Not bad if you can work with  the layers as you move through the levels of dreams and remembered visions. And know  something the French filmmaker's anxiety about Italian films' claims for more acute verity.

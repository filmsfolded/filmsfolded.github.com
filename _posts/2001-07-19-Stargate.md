Spoilers herein.

There are films whose appeal fades quickly, and this is one of them. By this, I mean that when I saw it new, it had appeal, but in a  recent reviewing it had none. Why?

It relied on some special effects, the juxtaposition of science fiction and Egypt, and the effect of a rising star.

The special effects were satisfying enough when new. Now, they offend by their cheesiness. I think this should be warning to any film: the arms race of effects ensures that any film that depends primarily on them will have a short shelf life. Even the early Star Wars films are already lost -- of no interest except historical.

The notion of mixing some scifi device with Egyptian themes was interesting. But they didn't exploit it creatively enough to stand out in the current crowd. Fifth Element did it better. The Mummy movies had richer -- for now -- effects.

What really gave this movie its edge was young Jay. Its hard to describe this now. He really thrilled in 'The Crying Game,' where he was supported by strong collaborators. We (at least North Americans) live in such an oddly closed world of sex, he was a real novelty. And that novelty gave this movie an edge it does not have now.

You may want to see this, not for its intrinsic merits, but as an example of three things that intrigued, but now do not.

Spoilers herein.

On its face, this is a pretty clumsy setup. We have the mystical gypsy on the sidewalk (whose  role seems to have been mostly edited out); the fantastic notion of a baker's life combined  with that of A NYC VP of Mergers and Acquisitions (and that the job has something to do  with firing people); the maudlin exercise of the retarded brother; the blunt metaphor of real  versus junk food.

It is all a jumble of uncoordinated pieces. But it is a food movie, and that almost always  works for me (well, except for 'Tortilla Soup') because food memories stretch the cinematic  experience.

And this has a particularly charming Bella. Sure it is a cheap shot, and not that hard to do.  But this old woman was easy to want to please.

It used to be easier.

We used to be smarter. Our politics was simple and reflected in the popular culture. For example, "liberal" meant that you had a more intellectual approach to difficult problems, and "conservative" designated a more common sense or direct philosophy.

We had comics that reflected these two now obsolete poles. On the conservative side was "Lil Abner" of dogpatch written by Al Capp. And for the more nuanced thinkers we had Pogo. Pogo was pretty deep and often very timely. I know of no regular strip of today that has the same power through metaphor. 

Well, meanwhile in the late sixties we had a spate of TeeVee versions of Comic strips, a trend started by "Peanuts." Now Peanuts was easy to adapt for TeeVee audiences because it had a homely humor, a sort of early Lake Woebegon template centered on children. Unfortunately for us, it was successful, so Pogo was enlisted and bent to the model.

This is an absolute disaster. None of Walt Kelly's wit is apparent. What we have is some unholy merger of Winny the Pooh and Peanuts but with Pogo's characters. Stay away; this will burn you.

This is the last Louis Moire, Max Candy film I expect to see. Max was supposed to be the great successor to Michael Ninn, in the "art core" genre: movies with clever stories and cineliterate components mixed in with ordinary porn. These interest me, in part because the porn is incidental. "Fashionistas" was a very good film in spite of its sex. and I'm a hard grader as regular readers know.

So I gave Max two shots, this and his earlier "Sensory Overload." They are both absolutely worthless. If it is porn you are after, I cannot see any difference between this and any junk on the internet, except the guys are less repellent elsewhere.

It hardly matters with something this so poorly done, but I have never seen a movie with sound this bad. Its particularly puzzling when you realize that most of the lines are dubbed. There are so few, it should have cost only a couple more Koruna and possibly kept this out of the trash wherever it goes.

If you are stuck watching it, there is one interesting feature. The director's wife, Keana Moire, is once again featured, more than any other girl in this one. In "Girl Girl Studio" she played the photographer of girls, effectively being her husband's avatar. In "Sensory Overload," she played the receptionist of a company that put on the sex shows. Here once again, she is the "reporter," associated with the filming of what is a sporadic news report broadcast from the site of the infection.

She's a pretty girl, a skinny small-breasted blond, perhaps already past her prime for fashion modeling. I make a small study of filmmakers directing the women they sleep with. She gets more screen time here than any other character. The voice he chose to dub over hers (credited as "Molly") is an unflattering choice. She's made more of a character than the others. Its not much, but her trait is that she accidentally kills folks. In a minor fold, a tape of the same threatens her at the end.

She completely changes in the last scene where the "virus" turns her into a sadist, torturing the mad doctor who has some silly lines about an era of sex substituting for religion. Those mad scientists!

This was written by Max. Max needs a better writer. The world does.

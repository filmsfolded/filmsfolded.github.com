I've been having such fun with movies, and the worse the better! Here's the game: pick a film at random and find something interesting to say, preferably something good about the film. I got lucky with this one.

It is bad, sure. And derivative, in fact wholly unoriginal. But the cool thing is its self-referential nature. 

Originally, horror movies were seriously scary. Now recently we've had a spate of selfparodies, which have both some shocks and spook, but which also wink. Here's a much more sophisticated stance:

Urban legends of various kinds populate the lives of hoards of stupid Americans, accompanied by conspiracy theories and the celebrity soaps. All of us delve into their addictive attractions while declaring to ourselves that we know better.

So here we have an movie that is about those same low additions while being one itself. It's beautiful! What makes it so much better is reseeing the DVD version with the writer and director's comments. They are so dumb, they could have come from a jughead comic, which adds a third dimension to this piece of urbane art celebrating those who may never escape gullibility.

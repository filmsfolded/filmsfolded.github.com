There's something quaint an offensive about films made in the UK during and before WW2 about war. Its propaganda, thinly covered, and nearly always showing British superiority of character. Here it is the human qualms that British conscripted assassins have about killing a man whose death would save millions. 

There's also something a bit odd about seeing Hitchcock before he became a cinematic genius. Some scenes are brilliant in their presentation and others inept. He always had confidence that the audience would overlook poor effects, but here its more extreme than usual.

Finally, there's a sort of severe discomfort in seeing Gielgud in a role he hated. Somehow, he thought his role was to be Shakespearean when he took it and was discouraged the way it turned out. The character is a novelist, something that could have given a Shakespearean fold. Hitchcock would have seized on that twenty years later, but here it zooms overhead.

Naturally, the climax takes place on a train. It seems trains and train scenes are almost a genre in themselves in British films for about 40 years. Nowadays, you hardly see a train unless there is a fight on top, a tunnel, and a helicopter.

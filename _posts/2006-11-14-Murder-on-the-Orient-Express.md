If you love watching movies, if you marvel at things you see and marvel at why, at who you and why film works, you'll like this.

It is a phenomenal failure, peppered with pleasures. Oh, what a strange marriage it is to put our trust in a filmmaker!

First the pleasures. Despite its failings of Christie in other ways, the Poirot character drawn here is closer to what Christie imagined than any other screen portrayal. I do like watching Suchet's prancing little twinkly man, and I am prepared to see any author's instincts compromised if it serves the larger construction. But the humor in Suchet's Poirot is there purely for the humor, not to support the stance of a detective, our surrogate watcher in the story.

Finney's Poirot has little charm. He's obnoxious. That fact that no one else could possibly appreciate the things he loves about himself is a necessary part of the character, the real one in the books. Same with Marple. Its perfect.

The movie as a movie is lush, and fun just on that score alone. Lumet's approach to film is to have a general feel about the larger scope of the thing, and then to fill whatever vessel appears in the creation that supports that grander vision. Few things have been as photographed as trains, and never so gloriously as here. The departure of the express from Istanbul (the "European" side) is one of filmdom's richest moments, especially if you include the appearance of our suspects (and their food).

And it has one of the most amazing performances you will ever see an actress give. It is short, only few minutes, but won an Oscar. But to appreciate it you need to know something of the actress. You need to know how hard this Swedish woman had to work to sound Swedish; its a hard thing because it involves and actor moving close to her soul and since she grew up in the tradition of being-acting you see from Ingmar, this is a real challenge. Creating a simpleminded character by itself would be less of a challenge.

Watch as she surrounds her lines with all sorts of silent conversations with herself, and carefully placed incidental expressions that the character wouldn't know showed her interior dialog. That the actress so carefully places what the character misplaces is magical. Instead of focusing on this, Lumet treats her like any other face on the train, like the stupid Hungarian couple played by stupid actors. Or the accident that was sold as Bacall.

And the final pleasure is awarded you only if you know "12 Angry Men." Its one of the most amazing films ever made and precisely perfect for Lumet's strengths and weaknesses. It depends entirely on the story emerging from what the actors give us. Its not the lines that have power, but the space the actors inhabit, a single room. The magic of the film is how the camera circles and probes in ways that the individuals in the group hijack the group leadership and probe the mystery of a stabbing. Who did it?

Lumet surely had this film in mind. Here is another jury, another group of 12, another claustrophobic, sequestered setting, another opportunity for camera and inquisition to merge. So sure is the overlap that the one neutral character in the story is Martin Balsam's, he from "12 Angry." So you'll revel a bit as the excellence of that earlier query is echoed in the dining car as Poirot is watched by us as he watches the 12.

But while Lumet has great instincts, he is essentially an actor. He sees only the small, and completely misses the larger shape of movies, any movie. He is actually stupid when it comes to this, depressingly, amazingly stupid.

Christie's story depends on the arrangement of compartments on that first class car. There's an intricate movement of people that has to be orchestrated in order for anyone to commit the murder. The challenge Poirot faces first is not who did it, but who could have. The way he works through it -- and the reader would too -- is by understanding how his unexpected presence in the car changed a careful plan. In the book, his key insight has to do with the geometry of a door lock. An alibi that was given in the book depended on what the witness saw when a practice session occurred. But Poirot's presence meant that the actual lock in question was on the other side, and therefore a mirror image of what the alibi "explained."

This is not a small matter, because the magic of Christie is how the reader and narrator are related in inventing the story. Its a matter of joint discovery and one of the miracles of modern movies and books. Take that away and you don't have Christie. You have instead only a big name to put up with the other big names in a stew that has no coalesced taste.

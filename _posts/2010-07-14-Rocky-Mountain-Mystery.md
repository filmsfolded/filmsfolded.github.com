Much of the effort that went into screen writing in the thirties had to do with exploring the role of the detective. Most of that was playing with the detective story. Watching many films from this era is fun just from the experimental nature of the narrative.

This is nominally a western. That is, there are horses, cowboy revolvers and hats. Our hero struts like all the other cowboys busy in other films establishing that genre. He has an honest heart, appears on the scene with no baggage and gets the girl. Otherwise, this is a standard detective story. Because it wants to make the case clear, it features a radium mine, something about as alien from the old west as possible. 

Judged as an experiment, it is pretty clever mix of genres. Judged as a detective story, it is slightly more complex than the ordinary. There is misdirection of a kind that seems predicable today but was likely a surprise then. (The murdered man had his face crushed in a mining press, so you know the body is not who it is claimed to be.) There is a surprise conspiracy.

The version I saw had the title "The Fighting Westerner," and I suppose they tried to market this both as a western and a mystery.

This comment is on episodes 9 and 10, which I am told are the best.

I have a special place in my heart for the absurd, especially the cleverly absurd. These guys have something like that gift.

But here's the problem. Its like anything else precious, it needs to surf what we consider normal. It has to establish its distance and it can only do that by varying in a deliberate way the level of absurdity. It requires a seduction of the mind, teasing us into and out of the amazing.

If it stays at the same level, it is just a blizzard of stuff. These guys have the stuff for the deep layered effect of fundamental absurdity, but it is lost because once they start, they keep us from the group zero that would contrast. A skilled artist would work back and forth, in and out, keeping us alert, guessing, trying to scope when something connects and deviates and how, and in what way. This is just all white, all the same; turn it on and get precisely the same level of deviance for ten minutes with no modulation.

Spoilers herein.

There are all sorts of life decisions, among them which worlds you'll adopt as the  homeland of your imagination. This is perhaps the most important function of film.

The choices are quite a few, and range all over the place. You, dear reader, will make  your own choices about who you are and where you are going. But for me, MedemÂ‘s  world is something worth cleaving to. 

It is a mix of intelligent exploration of self-reference and being; the tidal forces of fate  and emotion and both set in the play we call sex. It is more magical and less mechanical  than the typical French perspective. It is at once more abstract and human.

Tarkovsky has some of the same screen grammar but in his case the characters live in a  heavy world, and the gravity of the thing hangs like fog from which we can distill the  abstractions we ponder. Here, the whole world is distilled. Same eye, just a different  place.

Almodovar can create more striking images and situations at times, but one gets the  impression that he discovers as he goes instead of seeing the whole landscape before he  starts. 

This is not Medem's best work, but it is worth watching.

In this case, we have looking as a connection: the lovers and cows watching, the  painting, the photographing, the fluid histories, the letters. And we have the severing:  the logs, the political schisms, the feuds.

The young girl is remarkable.

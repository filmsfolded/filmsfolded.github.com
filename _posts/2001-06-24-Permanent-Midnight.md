Spoilers herein.

Just another story, but not very interesting. Good performances wasted.

Comparing this to 'Hurlyburly,' it seems really trivial.

The best part of the film was Janine Garofalo. Tiny role. Big space she occupies, just near the beginning. She controls the space around her. The others here only control themselves. 

When its just yourself, it can't matter so much.

The Holmes stories just as stories are pretty remarkable. They are of several types: -- Holmes as the great logician of human behavior: in these stories Holmes really does deduce; he figures out motive and events.

-- Holmes as the great data store. In this case, its not deduction but induction and scope. Holmes happens to know the residue of every cigar ash, the character of every type of clay in England, the manufacture of every type of paper. In these stories, he is a different sort of human computer, not smart exactly, just extremely knowledgeable.

-- Holmes pitted against the evil genius, originally Moriarty, but others in later stories, including women whose achievement gives them sexual attraction.

-- Mysteries solved because of Holme's mastery of disguise or his army of "irregulars." -- Stories that explore the boundary between science and the psychic. Doyle was the era's most eminant believer in the supernatural.

-- Holmes hobnobbing with the aristocracy.

This story is one of the weaker ones. It has elements of skirting the aristocracy (the so-called "client," who remains unknown) and the evil genius. The only problem is that we see no genius on either side.

Its just not enjoyable in any way, least of all cinematically, except for the redheaded heroine who foils the rape of the weakwilled victim.

I know it is possible to do this sort of film well. You know, the collection of jokes assembled around your standard family redemption story. The jokes have to be solid, it is absolutely required that we care about the families and the gimmick that fosters the redemption has to itself be engaging.

This relies on farts, dumb sex jokes and the equivalent for the humor. It simply made me feel dirty, and this in a film about escaping the juvenile. So don't expect good or frequent humor. The only time I laughed was near the end when a basketball game is being played between old high school rivals. Chris Rock is on one team, the gang we follow through the movie. A different black guy is on the other team and the two are against each other on the court.

With no hint of any community background, they argue first about who is the blackest, using as a measure how desperately white folks get scared in their presence. This is a brilliant piece of humor, and it must have come from Rock rather than the show's writers. After apparently besting his opponent, he quickly follows with "These are my white people. Go get your own." But everything other attempt at humor is tired.

I suppose Adam felt that with himself in the lead, he could make is care about his character, and by association the others. He doesn't; we don't.

So we are left with struggling to get value out of the narrative of redemption: how the men and their wives discover the value of... well, even that is vague. The value of spending time together I guess, though they had that before. But we do understand what they mean, sortof. That is because in the US, there is this myth about real family values, whose importance increases with the vagueness.

Thirty seconds of enjoyment in a movie is not enough. Get your own audience.

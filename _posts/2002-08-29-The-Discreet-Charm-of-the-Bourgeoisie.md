Spoilers herein.

I am attracted to intelligent films, especially films about the nature of reality and representation as convention. In particular, I am partial to narrative folding as in 'Sarragosa.' Moreover, I am one or the rare enthusiasts of Jarry, a Frenchman who noodled with surrealism in theater, a trickier notion than in easel painting. So on encountering this film, I had high expectations that have been thoroughly dashed -- dashed and trampled.

It comes down to film as art, and what one thinks art is. I'm not particular about this -- art has to either move me in some way (including intellectually), or it can be a 'statement' that I find intriguing or clever or even profound. This film comes close to neither. No more explanation needed there, though I suppose some would argue that true surrealism is supposed to be so intellectually anarchistic the point is the lack of point.

But that's not what this filmmaker tries. There's real satire attempted here. There's an attempt at folding, and some of the mirroring of images one finds elsewhere. There's some self-reference. There's some 'explanation.' There're the 'The Tempest' references. But none of this is fresh or clever or edgy or even impressively relaxed. None of it is even new. All of it smacks of nonchalant dilettantism.

My friends tell me that this is not the place to start with Bunuel, that I need to work my way up from his early films which were original and sadistically anarchistic. They say that his art must be seen a whole. But then we are into a life as art, and unless the person is truly interesting, why bother?

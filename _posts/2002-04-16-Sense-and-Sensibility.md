Jane Austen: This is her first and most human-centered work. More than cruel commentary on society this is -- Deft work.

Emma Thompson: Her former husband is a decent actor, but his genius is in understanding how to cinematize Shakespeare -- no small challenge and no small talent. I'm thinking of how he would later put Kate's Ophelia in a padded cell! What Emma has done here is change a detached narrative text into discrete scenes anchored by dialogue. A cursory comparison with other Austen films (except the later 'Emma' which borrows much from this) will bear this out. 

Ang Lee: This is Lee's first English film, and already since he has established himself as a sensitive master of vision, like Ridley Scott and Steven Soderbergh. Lots of sensitive uses of the space, especially doorways. Many hard/soft contrasts (which he equates with sense and sensibility which is okay). He is a subtle visualist. Subsequent work is more confident than this, but its all softly refined, understated.

Kate Winslet: All of the above are the results of first seriously public efforts and Kate's case is the same. At this writing seven years later, she is one of the anchors of multidimensional film acting. Kate makes this whole thing live. Austen's stance is one of self-aware storytelling: she is at once IN the story and OUTSIDE it, commenting on it. That's something that Kate already had mastered this early: she acts both the role and the girl acting the role.

Honorable mention: Emilie Francoise, whose screen presence is rather remarkable.

These things depend on a few elements. One is color and Cinemascope, new at the time. It actually mattered. Its why we have the goofy swirling paint at the beginning and end of this. 

Another is Poe. He wrote some scary stuff. But what mattered was the language first, situation second. Its hard to devise a way to transform this into cinematic form. What Corman does is use houses that are supposed to look haunted. And he uses skeletal shocks. That bag of tricks gets old fast. 

But at the end, they depend on Vincent Price. He's iconic so difficult to extract from the genre. I believe that if we had more of his verbal skill and less of his physical tricks, we would have been better off. That's because Poe's stories are rooted in the words. All the competence is in the words that support the story. Corman's staging and general cinematic sense is thin, so if we had more of British Shakespearean approach we'd have scarier movies, presuming they were written the way Poe wrote.

For an example, look at the very last scene. What's scarier? Seeing the eyes of the imprisoned, or hearing the sister say "No one will ever come in this room again."?

If Vincent had only stuck with the decisions he made in "Theater of Blood" and listened less to Corman's guidance to move like Lugosi.

Spoilers herein.

I like this kind of thing... not because it is in any way good, but because it fails in such interesting ways.

That's because the original was strongly influenced by the Alice in Wonderland stories. Its a very solid structural framework, on which a zombie framework was overlain. Milla is an extremely limited actress, but is an apt Alice in an Eastern European Svankmajer/Kinski sort of way. The actors are in a world layered between our world and a subterranean world of zombies, so they have some degree of control over the undermovie.

This sequel reverses it all. Here, the zombie movie is in control, including the zombies that are the corporate bosses. The characters we see and follow are the background, the manipulated. In fact, every action is manipulated. Milla's charm vanishes in this situation and we are left with something that can only be judged on its merits as an action picture. And on that level, well it shuffles.

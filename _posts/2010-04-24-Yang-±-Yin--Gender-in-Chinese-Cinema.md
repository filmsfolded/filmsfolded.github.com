This is a mess, something made with some sort of self-exploration in mind, inaccessible to us. 

The subject is males who play women or womanish roles in films. The stance of the film is that there is such a thing as discrete homosexuality and gender identity and that the Chinese are adventurous, far more so that the west. But it keeps stumbling over itself as the interviewed Chinese seem not to understand the framework. They just do what has been done, incubated in a culture that was parallel to the one that developed the rather stringent roles we as say Americans are working with.

We had the curse of Pauline Christianity and all that flows, shaping gender and sex in a uniquely western model gilded with guilt. There is much to explore in that model. And much to explore in the Chinese one. But to smash the two together and pick and choose as a matter of self-justification  well, that's perverse.

Some of the film segments are lovely.

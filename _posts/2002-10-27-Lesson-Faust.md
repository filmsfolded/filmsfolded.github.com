Spoilers herein.

This is lesser Svankmejer. What's interesting about it is how he combines the forces that influence man with those that control the puppets. Some of this is elegantly presented, as with the fade from the strings to a beam of light. But as with most of his notions, it is too obvious and blunt to be worth the effort by itself.

On almost any day, I'll take youthful exuberance and experimentation over more polished, accomplished, safe work. 

This is just that. It is energetic, but not particularly accomplished. There is no point, but the conception deserves celebration. 

--Animation inserted in live action

--Parallel universes

--Split screens

--Heavy zoom shots

--Hypermedia projections of the futures of incidental characters

--A few visual jokes (a cartoon croupier 'spins' her at the beginning)

--Black and white flashbacks

--Switching between video and 35mm

--Real time action for each thread

--Supernatural screams

--Techno pacing

Does this add up to a new genre? I'm skeptical, but IMDB voters put it in the top 75 films of all time!

When this level of risk and energy is turned toward a deep subject, we'll have something important. Until then, this is interesting enough.

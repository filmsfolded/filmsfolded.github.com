A life in film is a life of stories. Each film is its own world of course, But we weave and maintain higher level stories as well. Stories about genres, and cognitive structures. Stories about ideas and visions. We carry our own story as well, and so unavoidably make and carry stories about people in the trade.

Actors are tempting of course, because they are who we think we see and their choices matter. Filmmakers and writers capture me more, because they own the long form. Certain people matter and I invite them into my life accordingly. The cost is that I invite myself into their lives. One such is Guinevere Turner, a relatively minor figure who one day just wanted to make a movie with her lover.

She is now an actress, writer, director, producer. She's no genius, but I like her attitude and welcome a conversations with her.

Here is Annie Biggs. She looks like Guinevere. She seems to have just decided with her friends to make a movie. With them, she wrote, acted and produced the thing. It is far less attractive than "Go Fish." The production is subpar and the effects and computers make it instantly obsolete. But it is remarkably ambitious.

I am seeing this shortly after "Inception," so I will describe it as layers.

We have a guy who is a drug addict. It is ambiguous whether the drug is heroin, some future superdrug.

He runs a comicbook store and draws a comic about a master being hosted in "the" computer. Many fans buy this and enjoy it.

One is New Man (Newman) who is his abused girlfriend. A mousy recluse who spends all her time in a chatroom apparently dedicated to the world of the comic.

Part of the time, she is in that world, collecting souls, which the rest of us see as simple murder.

That's three of Nolan's layers, but the bottom one may be circular because the intelligent superbeing may really exist. The end is ambiguous. Two cops are our on-screen surrogates, exploring this. They mirror the fantasy couple and live in a simple movieworld cop genre with automatic lines, gestures and even the tough as nails boss.

Through this, Annie (a redhead), carries herself well enough to be on my list of someone possibly worth following. This crew made another film, seemingly as ambitious. I have not been able to find it.

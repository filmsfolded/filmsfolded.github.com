Australians understand the role of actors unlike any people on Earth. My own theory is that a single early drama teacher at the Opera House workshop spawned a whole national identity so far as actors.

Nichole, Kate and Toni are all of the same generation, all redheads, all have done what's called "folded" acting. Kate has been more consistent in this regard, but Toni in her Greenaway project and Nichole in her Luhrmann one have done deep folding as well.

Folded acting is much simpler than making a folded film. And the simplest kind of folded acting is what we have here: a strong woman playing a weak one. Clearly deliberate motions portraying tentative ones.

Contrast Toni with the actress who plays her mother. This woman (Jeanie Drynan) plays her character straight, as if she really was empty and demented. Toni's character has someone else within, but the skill comes in that inner person not being Toni.

(Notice that Muriel's retreat from her life is in a video store.)

The story is irrelevant. It is only an excuse to describe a broken soul (two actually), and grow a few situations that are designed to be pathetic or comic, sometimes both.

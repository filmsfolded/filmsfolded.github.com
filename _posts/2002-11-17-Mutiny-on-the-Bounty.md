Spoilers herein.

This is a minor picture, of interest to Brando fans only. I think it is his first major stumble.

In his best roles, he manages multidimensional performances. That's where he adopts at least two stances at the same time: a presentation of the character and a presentation of the actor playing the character. He is our first modern actor. 

But here, he is under a director who is uninterested in any art he might contribute. Brando is a rich set dressing only. This is an illustrated book, not a film. It is obvious that he is in his 'revel in the sense' mode rather than his 'reconstruct himself for projection' one.

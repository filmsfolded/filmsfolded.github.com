I urge you to see this for historical reasons.

The dominant shapes of narrative we have are governed by the detective story. Like most of the abstract structures we use -- and treat as if the world really was made that way -- are recent. This huge shape can be traced in film but if first appeared in literature, with mister Collins.

We would not have a recognizable detective for a few iterations. There are still remnants of the Dickensian model where peculiar characters shape the world. Mister Fairlie here, an absurdly nervous effete and his meek assistant are from that model. The intrigue as well: a family fortune complexly entailed.

But the notion of an outside observer who is on screen, structuring the narrative from observations we share is new. Our "detective" is a professional observer, a painter. This profession was the closest that then existed to the qualities we need.

What we would now consider part of the detective duties -- being an on screen observer in addition to sensemaker -- is shared by the love of the painter. Here the role is played by a heartbreakingly lovely earnest actress. The stock is black and white but we know she is redheaded.

Cinematically, they have missed the opportunity to leverage the process of logical assembly that goes on in the mind of the artist. That would have been profoundly cinematic. The specific inadequacy of this film is what inspired Greenaway with "Draughtsman" which you might watch with this.

The cinematic carrying is done here by Greenstreet. His device is that he has the ability to hypnotize. It is women-only and apparently intuitive. The filmmaker does well enough with this.

You won't find this to be a very good film. But it is an accurate enough version of the book. And that started something that every film student needs to understand.

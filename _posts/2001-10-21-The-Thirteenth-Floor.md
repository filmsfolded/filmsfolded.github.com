Spoilers herein.

Most movies are at least superficially about real people. 'Matrix' ('Truman' and many others) put real people in artificial worlds. 'Bladerunner' (and lessor films like 'AI') put artificial people in the real world. Now finally we have artificial people in artificial worlds, unknowingly as in 'Bladerunner.' A clever beginning, but not enough.

The production values are not the problem, nor is the level of acting -- so many successful scifi picts have uninspired acting that it is nearly a prerequisite. The problem is that the film is too safe. It decides to impress on an intellectual level, which is noble but dangerous.

Safety: everything is understandable, even predictable. The ending is safe: there IS a reality and creators after all folks. The mechanics are safe: controllable (at least in this story) computers.

The notion could have really done a fine number by using a more sophisticated notion of computers (the story seems set in the 60s so far as technology) and by tying the notion of virtual reality for entertainment to film and then the very film WE are watching. Like 'My Dinner With Andre.' Like 'Draughtsman's Contract.' Even 'Sweet and Lowdown' which also had Gretchen.

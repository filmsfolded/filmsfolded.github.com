In its form as a book, this is one of the most intriguing in the world. It is credited as being the first detective novel. I think it was. Surely, it wasn't the first detective story, but a novel is a special sort of narrative that by definition includes some examination of itself. It is a high form of art.

In the book, you can see this experiment with different viewpoints, different truths. Its a shifting sand, a hidden box, a watchful god without an eye, a smeared picture and it contains all those things. 

In this production, its rendered as a mere story, with one simple narrative stance. All the thrill is gone. Its now a simple story and the viewer will wonder why anyone cared. It has poor production values in all respects except the costumes, which alone for many people will carry the day.

You still have the fold of "re-enactment," which matters though dimly. You still have the Indian watchers, and the hints that the moonstone is an eye. But everything else is so bollixed up that it simply seems to be a high school play of a musical but without the music.

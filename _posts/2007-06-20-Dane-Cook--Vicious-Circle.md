You know, we fool ourselves. We clump things together because of characteristics that show we do not understand. For instance, we have this category of "hobbies," a strange way to organize things we choose to do.

Comedy is like that. I believe. If we laugh at things, we clump them together as if they had something in common.

So this is called comedy. I think I'd call it great storytelling. These aren't jokes -- they're life, spun in a way that we have to laugh. Its the Bill Cosby style of storytelling. Stuff from marriage, childhood, friends. Long, long introspective memories.

What works here is that the man does draw us unto his stories. He's quite talented at this. He's less talented at turning that attention into the sort of startling twists or insights that constitute great humor. But it hardly matters because our investment in the story is deep enough for us to laugh at less clever comic devices.

If you are interested in who you are, surely you are interested in why you laugh. This helps.

And you'll laugh too.

He's on a small circular stage. Look closely at the design of the pattern. Its a hand.

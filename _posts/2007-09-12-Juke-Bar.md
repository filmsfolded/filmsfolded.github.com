The thing I look for in animation (I mean short form here) is novelty. You can do so very much with artificial worlds, and should use that scope when you can. With one exception, we've seen everything here elsewhere and better. In particular in the later Gremlins so far as the actions and characters, and various big projects so far as the fun.

The one very nice thing is two teen roaches. The girl gets squashed by the jukebox when it is delivered. Its so out of tune with the happy nature of the thing it stands out. Later, as the box is taken away the bug is restored. This tiny part was good, especially what we think is the death crunch.

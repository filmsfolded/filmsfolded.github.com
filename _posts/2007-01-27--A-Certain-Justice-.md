PD James is something of an important cusp in the great experiment of the detective story. The old form had a person in the story that was midway among the stuff of the story, the stuff of the creator of the story and the stuff of the watcher. James' new form had us discover the nature of the detective as well as the mystery, which took a back seat. Elizabeth George and others followed suit and a new genre was born.

As it happens, the foibles of the characters IN the mystery melded with those of the man (and us?) UNRAVELLING the mystery.

Its a great innovation. Its worthy of a good cinematic adaptation. 

This is not a great adaptation, rather just another cookiecutter staging. There's a final irony about punishment, but it hardly matters because the enclosing irony, the ironic situation of the form was ignored.

Two things interest me about this.

One is how Ridley approaches a project. Other than "Bladerunner" he is conspicuously uninterested in story. He only uses the story as a necessity, like light and time, rather than a scaffold for the narrative. His narrative isn't in illustrated story, but in the texture of the cinematic presentation itself. For Ridly, it is all about what you see.

Therefore, what you get is a collection of textures and rhythms that convey by themselves the primary value. This is something that his actors do not get clued in to; I think he uses strong actors in ways that they want to be strong. He doesn't shape them into the thing much, except with Crowe he helped him lean into the edit.

That's a technique where each scene is not there to provide information but to set up the next scene where we expect information to be conveyed. In this way, we always live in the future, anticipating the story rather than catching up. Its rather brilliant because it takes some time for film reality to seep in, so if you have the viewer always living a few moments in the future, he will be in the present when you need him to be.

This has that. It has Crowe doing that for Ridley, here literally as an on-screen filmmaker/observer. Brother often Tony plays with this idea of spy observer in the film, but this is a whole new level of sophistication.

The second interesting item is more mundane. It has to do with Hollywood film beauty. North American and European films have no trouble finding beautiful women of all races and facial types. Its actually common now for us to see multiracial faces.

The only exception is Arab women. Its a strange effect of 9-11, I think, that in the lamentable demonization of Arabs we have lost Arab beauty as well. It was natural in "Aladdin" to think of Jasmine as an unqualified beauty. The animators did not cheat either: her face and indeed her bearing are from genuine sources. But since 9-11 there seems to be no beauty in Arabia. 

Look here. They needed a love interest in Jordan for our troubled agent. It means little in the story. Its just more texture, more cinema. What do we find but an Iranian woman doctor who by some plot device is in Jordan. The actress (I understand) knows little Arabic. She is lovely.

I'm not one who is interested in using films to further a social agenda. I think it is dangerous and would probably fight anyone using movies for oblique propaganda, even for causes I agree with. But surely a way to prevent demonization of a people is to celebrate the beauty of their women (when we can see their faces).

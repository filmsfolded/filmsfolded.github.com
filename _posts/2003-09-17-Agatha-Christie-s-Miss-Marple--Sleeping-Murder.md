Spoilers herein.

These Marple films are driving me crazy! The books are so clever, so experimental and  adventurous. These film versions are so ignorant of how the books are put together it  leaves me breathless. In this case, the idea is that the house (including the grounds) is  itself a witness, a character. 

The competing realities in this mystery are all triggered by that space. There are films  that use architecture as characters, and do it well. But not here. What a waste.

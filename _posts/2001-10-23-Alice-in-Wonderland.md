Spoilers herein.

The Alice stories are among the most important in all literature, period. Not because they are charming, because they aren't really, not in that patronizing Winnie the Pooh sense. But because they are deliberately deep in ways mystical, mathematical and linguistic.

The hooks are in the details. If you scour them off, you have incoherence mixed with wacky racers, which is what you have here. This production is apparently for Australian TeeVee and video, and has very poor production values. But that wouldn't have mattered if they hadn't trod on the material. To their credit, they stick closer to the events of the first book, and and use more of the language than most, but with clearly little understanding of what was leveragable.

Alas, poor Alice.

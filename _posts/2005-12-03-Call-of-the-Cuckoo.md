The main story here is the standard stuff of destroying a house and car, with some pretty offensive antisemitic stuff as the center.

Both of those elements are pretty disposable, a worthless film, except for the side story. 

The reason for the destroyed house is that Mr. Gimplewart traded his house for this one because he couldn't stand the neighbors. In the credits, they are called "asylum inmates," but there is nothing in the movie that imposes this sense on them.

Anyway, we see them early in the thing generally acting nuts. I've been watching a lot of Laurel and Hardy recently. I don't expect to see everything -- they are just not that interesting.

But the few moments they are on screen have to be the funniest I have ever seen of them. It makes it worthwhile. Just watch that part.

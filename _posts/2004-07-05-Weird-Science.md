Spoilers herein.

We all live in our own movies. Most Hughes films deal with adolescent elements of this in  simpler ways than here. In this case, we have a movie about two kids who create their own  'movie."

All the humor is movie humor: characters from another movie invade for instance.

The problem is that Hughes usually plays it both ways: he demonstrates how artificial the  imaginings of the teen are and at the same time sucks us into the warm sweetness of those  same imaginings. The fulcrum is usually Molly Ringwald who knew to support this enterprise,  I presume intuitively. She made Hughes a success, not the other way around.

And isn't that what this is all about?

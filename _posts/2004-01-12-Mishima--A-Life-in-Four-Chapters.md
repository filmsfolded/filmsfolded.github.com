Spoilers herein.

Paul Schrader isn't an accomplished man in terms of creating novel visions. But he is an  alert and active thinker of things cinematic. Whatever he does is worth pondering, even  when the picture itself is flawed in some ways. (And even when one of his Italian director  friends changes his ideas.)

In this case, we have what I consider his most complex notion: a film about a man who  lived his life as if it were a film, moreover a film that he could and did write. 

Even that idea could have been handled in a pedestrian manner, by showing the man and  his life. But except for the final suicide episode, Schrader doesn't show the 'real' life --  instead he stages episodes from the writings, mostly in a Kabukified dream manner.

Schrader's commentary on this DVD is one of the best I know. It remarks that though this  life was based on fabrication, the movie was mandated to be based on truth. But the  original fiction the subject created is preferred by the Japanese authorities (and  apparently the public, still) so the thing has never been released in Japan and the  Japanese financiers have denied being so.

Adds another level of fabrication to an already rich project.

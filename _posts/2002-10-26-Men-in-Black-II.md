Spoilers herein.

Is it enough to have a few good jokes?

Is it enough to have some of last year's effects?

Is it enough to have Jones play straight man to Smith's sitcom mugging?

Is it enough to hear Elfman's honks again?

No, but its interesting to note that the cheesy video within is as dumb compared to this as this is to reality.

The girl is pretty. I'll bet she was a highly engineered selection to be as desirably raceless as possible, further emphasizing the 'one world' underlying moral. This has a pretty good fireworks show at the end. Big screen a must.

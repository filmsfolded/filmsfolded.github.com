Spoilers herein.

You can watch this the way the establishment wants you to: as a seminal noir, cheaply  but effectively done, with most of the enjoyment from appreciating its role in film  history. Sort of like visiting Nixon's childhood home, one gets a certain indirect value  from the knowledge of the experience rather than the experience itself.

I believe that ruins the whole thing. Noir - real noir - is destroyed by such histories.  Either you have to take it as it is, or discard it. Noir films by definition have no history,  they are themselves a subversion of history.

Noir is an intrusion of the narrator into our personal space. It exists less as an artifact  than as the experience of a conversation. In noir, the actor looks at us and tells us a  story. The link between the teller and us is a matter of pure chance, and that chance  about relationships always underlies the story. 

What we see is the story as invented - or partially invented - by the teller. In this case,  the narrator is an unimaginative dope, so it makes perfect sense that the sets and acting  all be frankly artificial. And that the dialog all be pulled out of pulp fiction. And that the  lighting be that vulgar, emotional stuff the Germans liked before it became art.

This a story (the narrator's) about a story (Al's) in which he is tricked - almost - into  telling a story (about him being Haskell) so that the woman who wants to be called Vera  doesn't tell a story (to the police).

You can read elsewhere about the various components of this (including the remarkable  flash forward in the midst of the flashbacks), but you probably will find no mention of  the Chopin. Chopin factors in all sorts of film, from 'Five Easy Pieces' to 'Autumn Sonata'  to the recent 'The Pianist.' he is to solo piano as noir is to film, indeed inspired a literary  tradition that noir reflects.

So pay attention to the boogie woogie rendition of Chopin at the point in the story where  fate is perturbed. It wasn't the germy ten dollar bill. This is actually a wonderful musical  essay. I wish I knew who created it. Could it be Rubenstein from the film 'Carnegie Hall'  of the following year? The hands say yes.

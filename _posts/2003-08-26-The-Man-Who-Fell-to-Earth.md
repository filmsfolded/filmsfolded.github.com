Spoilers herein.

Roeg's interest is simple: we are to his films are as the characters in his films to the  strange worlds they visit.

"Walkabout" was very Intelligent and passionate I thought, even though the metaphor of  sexual of awakening for greater awareness is a little thin. That film knew what it was  about and where the line was between passion and abstraction. It even had a comment  on it: while our disparate teenagers enjoyed each other, another part of the outback was  visited by Fellini. Yes, Fellini in the form of an Italian crew, complete with Felliniesque  icons such as balloons and leering and abstract humor.

Some wondered why that was there. It seemed so out of place, but that was the point. 

This film tries much the same: two people from different worlds: sex as the metaphor;  society as damaged, plus vague ecological themes; gauzy scenes. But it lacks the clarity  "Walkabout" had -- it crosses over that Fellini line where passionate mystical realism  becomes abstract sentimentalism.

There's less of "Nostalgia" in this and too much of "Five Easy Pieces." And its not Bowie's  fault.

I've now seen several film versions of this book. This could be the worst, in the sense that it ignores the structure of the thing. The quality that would later be called "Gothic" had as much to do with extraordinary symmetries as it does dark settings. This version blows away all these symmetries, in order to compress the thing. But its a scandal so far as the attractive qualities of the story.

And it is so stagy as to be laughable, especially the bloviated score. The actress who plays Jane was well enough known, but she just doesn't have the chops for the part.

But its still an intriguing project. It has Welles in the second role. He so overpowers Joan that it almost seems the story has been recentered. The role is something of a disaster. Rochester is something of a mystery in the book: cruel, and especially cruel to Jane, only loving her because she survives it. To know why she does, you'd have to know more about her past than is shown here.

So don't watch it for the story, because its so sliced up it doesn't work. See it for Welles at his worst. Yes, I meant it. He's created some of the most important and powerful works ever. His first and last are what I mark as especially important. But after Kane, he really did become impossible. Not impossible to work with. That too probably. But impossibly blunt and overblown. 

Look at the staging here, some of the dramatic effects are so unsubtle and big, so gross and obvious, so theatrically sterile that you want to cry. It it were not Welles, we'd have forgotten this long ago. 

See it for the excess, the waste. A genius drunk on his own imagination.

Oh. It has Margeret O'Brien, in that two year period where her star was bright. It almost seems a conservation of talent: Welles loses, Maggie gains.

Just as in the story -- as written.

A performance about performing. A story written by and about a fellow learning how to find the story. The performances here (of the performer) are shown to be cheesy, cheap showmanship -- and that's true of the film as well.

The only slightly engaging thing is three moments, each about 15 seconds, where there is a reference to the dark forces as explaining the talent (and somehow insinuating that homosexuality is involved).

There is earnest narration, but all in all, this is just another minor amusement from the Hanks production company. Watching it makes you aware of this. The great Mister Hanks even makes an appearance in a role tailored to allow him to claim this as well beneath him.

The mettle of an actor, I think, can be seen through the projects they make happen because they can. Hanks cannot ever contribute something to a weighty project because he simply has no heft as a being. He is a lot -- dare it be said -- like the fellow in this project.

I'm amazed at how uninteresting these Cadfael episodes are.

But in this one, I found two remarkable things. The first is how bluntly and exclusively it features copulation. I think there are five or six couplings; it is as if the author though he missed it in previous volumes and wanted to make up all in a hurry. Its pretty much the whole story -- sexual urge.

The second thing, far more interesting, is watching two actors who appear in minor roles. Toby Stephens and Natascha McElhone. Both of these seem more intense than those surrounding. Both have gone on to careers as effective but uncelebrated screen actors -- a rare thing. I have counted them both as valued guides into obscure places.

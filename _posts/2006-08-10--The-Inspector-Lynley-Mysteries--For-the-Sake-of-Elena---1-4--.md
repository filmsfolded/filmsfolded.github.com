Some of these are excellent, and some poor. This is a poor one, I'm afraid.

The mystery involves a fold of sorts, all is motivated, we learn, by an artist and in a way her art is the body. The book made more of the fact that the professor here was an expert in transferred symbols, and that's a main dynamic in the mystery.

Those two facts are why I tagged this as having spoilers.

There's a third dynamic she folds in, the notion that the corpse who "speaks" is deaf so unable to speak well. In life, she speaks via sex. It parallels the notion in the book that the story is presented cinematically, rather than by having one cop "explain" things to another.

So three folds in the original story. Bluntly noted and defused in the TeeVee-ization.

It would have been so east too. Its a tale of strong, strong, damaged women orbiting each other and wreaking tidal havoc in their lives and the ones they encounter. Its a twist on the small house setup. We know that one of the three women we are introduced to did it. One of them surely. But why?

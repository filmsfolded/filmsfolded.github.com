Spoilers herein.

For a film to matter to me, it has to exist. It has to have been born and to the extent and in  the way that you believe things have purpose and effect, it has to have that.

I don't care if the beingness is accidental or borrowed or poorly copied. It can be an  antibeing. It can be almost any creature in the pantheon that can elbow the world.

As my regular readers know, I see a lot of movies that people consider bad and don't like.  But I can still admire some clever or interesting notion in their being.

This one seems to have been stumbled upon in a wander through 'True Romance' (or better,  'Miami Blues'), 'Two Zeds and a Nought,' and 'Dog Day.' Its only reason to exist is to  support a post-ending possibility of HIV, together with the ambiguity of whether Zed or Zoe  were infecting the other (as foreshadowed by clumsy use of 'Nosferatu.')

The only mildly interesting elements are the inclusion of Delpy and her use of the 'White'  'might have been, might be' tone from that being to this. And the big raspberry to the  French.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

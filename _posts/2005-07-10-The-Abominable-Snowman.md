Before Hammer became possessed by demons from the grave, they experimented with other supernatural horror. This is a particularly good one for the period, employing lots of location shots in the mountains.

Those mountains provide two key elements of the story: isolation and Tibetan mystics. 

The setup is from "King Kong," commercially-minded adventurer seeks to capture the beast. In this case, the beast may be an alien precursor of humans, certainly superior and capable of telepathy and telekinesis.

The idea is good and the production values too. That may be enough for you if you like old horror. But the actual setup lacks real horror and is too tame on the mystical side as well. At least by modern standards.

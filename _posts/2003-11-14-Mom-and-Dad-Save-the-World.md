Spoilers herein.

I really liked this, and for much of the same reason I dislike Mel Brooks. With Brooks, the  gags are king; around them you arrange characters. And then you fabricate some sort of  story and surroundings.

Projects like this start with a notion about a world, in which you have a story, which has  characters which have gags. It is a more coherent way of creating. Now, in both cases,  say this and 'Space Balls,' you have rank stupidity and juvenile humor. But here, the  humor is situated in a world whose physics is itself funny.

Its a little like the Bizzaro Superman world. An even better example is the world of Dr  Seuss. And indeed the set design is a cross between organic exotica of Cronenberg and  Geiger, art nouveau architecture and Dr Seuss.

You really only watch these sorts of things for the art and hope that there is enough  charm and humor to take up the rest of the space. This art is pretty good. Not great like  the sets for 'Casper.' But engaging.

And there are a few jokes, especially the in jokes like having Wallace Shawn be a  brainsucker. He had long since done 'Andre' and was beginning work on 'Vanya.' This  joke is sweet.

Terri Garr may not have been the right one for this role. I would have picked Joan Cusack  and cast her brother as her husband. Or maybe Geena Davis of just a couple years  earlier.

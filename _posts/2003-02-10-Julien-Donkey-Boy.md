Spoilers herein.

This is neither pony nor donkey, but something in between, sterile.

Let me qualify my comments with the observation that I thought 'Gummo' was brilliant. It took an immature world, introduced a studied dementia, and mapped that in visual narrative. It worked, I presume, because Korine personally understands that specific twisting of sight. It's more than drugs, more than inbred neglect. It is something mythical, something on the edge of our lives threatening overt haunting. The creation of the world, the presence of the eye in that world and the transformation to presented image were absolutely one.

Having done that, Korine tries the same twist of sight to describe a world he does not intimately know. He adds the complication of 'dogma.' This confuses the harshness of reality with that of unreality. The double dissonance becomes one of incompetence - outside the art - rather than what was attempted.

There are some standout performances here, but films like this need to avoid discrete standouts at any cost. Nevertheless, Werner Herzog - both in person and as a character - is much weirder than this project; that knowledge alone is frightening. Young Chrissy is enchanting as the girl who goes on the become the champion skater. 

But, I can recommend this film for the amazing skill in editing. Some of it just left me breathless.

I am fond of double features. I saw 'Donkey-Boy' with 'Begotten.' Similar values and risks. No comparison in the results.

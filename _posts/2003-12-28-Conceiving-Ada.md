Spoilers herein.

One can fault the dreary focus on women's victimization, as if something like that can be imposed on any past. And one can be annoyed at the very low production values, and goofy acting by all but Swinton. Also, everyone involved seems to have had multiple, profound misunderstandings about what constitutes software, concepts, coding and virtuality. Among the howlers are clicking as programming and photography as somehow capturing avatars. And code as resembling greek symbols. This is even worse than 'Pi' in its pseudoscience.

But if you can see through all those indications of ignorance, there is the kernel of something intelligent here. Some have criticized the modern story as a clumsy framing device. But I see it as a class of folding, something along the lines of 'French Lieutenant's Woman,' as transformed by popular versions like 'Possession.'

At least I want to think so because Tilda is such an intelligent actress and the Ada story is so fascinating. What this petty filmmaker thinks is interesting is that a brilliant, energetic mind was exploited and ruined by the accident of gender  sort of an Alan Turing with breasts.

What is more interesting in the story is how Ada conflated adventures in mental exploration in narrative with mathematics and extreme promiscuity. In fact, the story is much like John Nash's but without the bisexuality.

Math as orgasmic, code as music, virtual projection as invented history, redheads as having the power to use lust to bend reality. Some clever ideas wrapped in stupid expression. Well, at least there's something.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3  Has some interesting elements.

Of the four Mrs Bradley mysteries that were made before the series was canceled, this is the best. I don't recommend any of them, but if you must, watch this one.

It has a real mystery, not a hoked up Hardy Boys adventure. It actually exploits the period well, in fact better in terms of aura than any of these cookiecutter period mysteries from the UK. We still have that awkward device of the butler-bedcompanion to the aged flapper, but he is more real here than in the others.

There is still a lot of lazy writer's crockery: poisoned arrows, blackmail. But let that pass and you find a story every bit worthy of Dorothy Sayers. And at the end, you'll still have a mystery unresolved, one that makes things seem more human than otherwise.

Its not enough, wasn't enough for them to keep making the series, nor me to actually recommend it to you. But pay attention at the beginning to the state of the hurried maid and let that work on you a bit.

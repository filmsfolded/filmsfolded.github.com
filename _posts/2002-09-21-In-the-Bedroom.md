Spoilers herein.

This film has developed a following, it is said, because of the fine performances. I suspect its endorsement of warm vigilantism in post 9-11 society has something to do with it as well, down to the resemblance of the plant to a refinery.

This is a very polished work, in three acts. The central portion -- which is also the heart of the film -- is miniepisodic. Some scenes only last a few seconds, most with little or no dialog followed by fades to black. These are effective, but in a theatrical rather than a cinematic sense. And that's what's wrong here.

An actor is in charge, not a filmmaker. He, therefore crafts a vehicle for the art of acting. This he does well, and is helped by a script that implies that all these characters are acting themselves. But no feat of acting, no matter how great, can satisfy us when we enter that dark space and turn our visual imagination over. For that we need someone who imagines the experience visually first, and then supports it with actors rather than the other way around. If this were approached like 'Ice Storm' was, it might be a life-altering experience. As it is, we have simply another amusement, where we are taken nowhere unsafe by skilled guides.

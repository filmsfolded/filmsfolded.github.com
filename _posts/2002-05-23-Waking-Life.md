Spoilers herein.

I eagerly awaited this. Read up on it: It is just the sort of thing I appreciate: ideas about the nature of being in the context of performing (like 'My Dinner with Andre' and 'Baby of Macon' and dozens of other really smart films); adventure in the visual medium (like 'Pillow Book' and 'Man with a Camera'); conflating reality with lucid dreaming.

But what we get is conflatus. The problem is that the ideas that are thrown into this blender aren't very smart, or even interesting. Its the sort of thing you hear from the uninvited drunk guest at a party, the guy who you know is has been there with drugs and never really came back and who wants to wrap his confusion in respectable philosophical ambiguities. This is the 'Mallrats' and 'Dogma' level, aimed at the 'oh wow' high school crowd.

But I want to encourage you to rent it anyway. You won't find it important or engaging. But you will be supporting the notion of adventure in independent cinema. Its a good cause.

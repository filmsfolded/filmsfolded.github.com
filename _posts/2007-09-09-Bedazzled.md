A solid bet in humor is to take a character and shift him into another body. Its better if its more than one. 

The story here is just an excuse to do that with a talented comic actor. If you just focus on that, considering this a collection of comic skits, its partially tolerable. The odd thing is how tepid the humor gets when it veers toward matters sexual. Its all about sex, that sort of perfect movie love that's centered in sex. There's a small penis joke, but otherwise, the studio rating engineers oddly steer clear of all the stuff that could have been really funny with this body and identity shifting.

Their substitute? Hurley. Doesn't cut it.

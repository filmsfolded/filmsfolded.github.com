Spoilers herein.

I saw 'Guffman' immediately before this, and my reaction was negative. It was funny in spots, but simple funniness isn't enough by itself for me.

This is a little different. As with 'Tap' and Guffman' the central device is a show bracketed by a documentary. But here, there is a greater spectrum of realities. Each character (or character pair) creates their own reality which varies more widely than the prior film, plus there is anchor of 'real' reality. The goofy thing is that the real reality is the dogs and the non-featured other dog owners. A strange anchor. As we move through the scenes, we get buffeted by the discontinuous, unrelated worlds like walking from one theater to another in a multiplex.

What makes this interesting for me is Guest's character. He creates a reality that is between Burton's PeeWee and something Sean Penn would do, say his Jazz Banjoist. Very multilayered. Very intelligent. Just the right ingredients: a telepathic dog; a dummy; A 200 year old log cabin filled with beach balls; two phantom hills that aren't (or rather, are); nuts; flies; counties.

But to get to that, you have to wade through an hour of uninspired improv: two ordinary gay guys; two anal lawyers and so on.

It puzzles me why Guest works with Levy. Guest's humor draws you in -- he's personal, human, lightly dark. Levy is juvenile, strutting, cynical.

Supposedly, this is the mix from 60 hours of material. I would have watched two hours of Guest alone. The rest is a waste.

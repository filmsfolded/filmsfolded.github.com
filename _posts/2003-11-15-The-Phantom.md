Spoilers herein.

These films are all about the art. If you get that right, all of the ancillary silliness turns  into support instead of irrelevance. 

So many of these fail in the art. 'The Shadow' and 'Daredevil' succeed where 'Dick  Tracy,' 'Spiderman,' 'Superman,' and several of the Batmen fail. 'Popeye,' and the  second Batman are special, interesting cases.

Here, the original comic posed a world of near-magic, something between an R L  Stevenson magical fiction and the ordinary superheros of the day. The mix of tribal  magic and industrial determinism was the whole point. The white man's burden,  softened by a romanticized notion of natural purity.

This has more to do with the yearning behind the creation of the Boy Scouts than by  romance or adventure.

But the movie turns it into a jungle version of Buck Rogers.

If you wish to get value out of this, watch it back to back with 'CQ,' which is about the  very same thing as the comic: about how film transmutes that romantic purity into  something that has to be handled differently than in a comic because it overlaps with  reality. In other words, 'CQ' works because it is about the phenomenon that makes this  film fail. Zane stars in CQ in precisely the same role as here.

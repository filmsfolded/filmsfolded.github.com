What a difference a few decades make. When this movie was made, these were the coolest guys in the world for anyone over 25. They were cool because they thought so themselves and everyone believed them.

At least we did then. Now we see not only a particularly bad caper movie, we see how uncool these guys really were. Frank was merely a selfish bully, the skinny kind who paid others to rough people up. 

So we see many stories here. We see the caper story.

We see the story about 5 guys who pretended to matter and did for a while, long enough to make lots of money and have a lot of sex.

But there's a bigger story here, one that this movie evokes more than any other I know. Its the story of America, the America defined by entertainers, the one the French New Wave thought was real. You can research it quickly by seeing "The Ocean's Eleven Story," a poorly made documentary, but one that hits most of the buttons.

These guys, at this time, were behind making the Mob bigger than they ever had been before. They married the Mob with presidential politics, even pimping to the president. This was where Marilyn's suicide was made inevitable. And Mob hits on Castro, and the embarrassment of the FBI by RFK, and subsequent rage by Frank at being jettisoned.

There is suicide and assassination behind their misogynistic prancing, their assumption that all they had to do was show up, and we would swoon.

This is an important film, if you think film is important.

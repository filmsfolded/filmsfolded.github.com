Spoilers herein.

I'm an enthusiast of films that are works or art, that show life as a constructed work of  art and that incidentally bind the two together by making the protagonist a writer (or  filmmaker). This film joins my list of several hundred such.

What makes it unique is the notion of fate made explicit: as our croupier as someone  who not only watches people lose in a system that is stacked against them, but becomes  both obsessed with and dependent on that watching. His watching is both the subject of  the movie and his book. Naturally, we discover that he is being watched and has a  manipulated fate as well. Some women move in and out of his life.

Very solid stuff that could have made a great film. But when you make a reflexive film  about watching, it should make US into the watchers. Instead, to accompany this  promising situation is a collection of voiceovers. It just doesn't work. And the players  don't seem to know that this material is layered and requires some acknowledgement of  the layers -- like Cate Blanchett did with the similarly obsessive gambling/watching film:  "Oscar and Lucinda."

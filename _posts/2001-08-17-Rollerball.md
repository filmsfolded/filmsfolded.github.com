Spoilers herein.

Personal battles fought in a public arena. Success in the public arena feeding those problems. 

Gladiator? Men of Honor? Dozens of films in fact.

A couple things make this film interesting:

--A remake is imminant. It is supposed to be pure action, no 'message,' Its always fun to see and know the original before the remake. I only saw the original Limey after Soderbergh's great translation, for instance. The remake in this case will be just precisely what the original warms against.

--Some real talent is involved in this effort, well before scifi became common in film. Houseman was one of the key geniuses behind Citizen Kane, Sir Ralph is with Gielguld the father of modern Shakespeare. Jewison has given us some real turkeys (Hurricane) but Agnes is great -- Moonstruck is highly competent. Caan was still a great actor at this time, before his problems.

So it is with some wonder I wade through this. It's not science fiction except in the purest early pulp tradition. Instead, it is a simple story of a gladiator, with the context fluffed up out of cardboard. Never mind. There's some woman stuff in there. More cardboard. What's fascinating is how stupid is the character -- Caan plays the sort of clueless jock that would have thought this film was deep. 

The computer room in Geneva is a gas.

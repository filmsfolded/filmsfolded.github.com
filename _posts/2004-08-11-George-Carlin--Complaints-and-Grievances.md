Spoilers herein.

I consider George a national resource, a hero. I've been watching a lot of standup DVDs with  increasing despair. These guys just aren't funny, at least they aren't if you spend a half a  second thinking about what they're joking about.

George is different. His humor is all about confronting the evils in society. And he is fearless  in coming so very close to the edge, so close we worry about his sanity while laughing at the  risks. The thing is, nearly all this risky stuff is stuff we recognize.

His stuff may not last long because it is so attuned to the times. So he may not be  remembered as well as he should be. Laughter is all about confrontation, and this guy is in  the vanguard. A gem.

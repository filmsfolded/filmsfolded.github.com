I suppose there's a reason for this in some folk's mind. Southern white trash giallo with some added components: celebration of the bad guys. It isn't as much like "Bonney and Clyde" as "Badlands," in that it merged the notions of evil and place. It actually works better in the hick south and the eagerly accepted stereotypes of southern heavy metal.

There are four of five ways to cinematically celebrate violence. Some are purely cinematic and justifiable: "Way of the Gun" and "Last Man Standing" come to mind. Others are merely movies of cruel motion. Zombie doesn't know the difference, though his C-list editor seems to.

The first of this presumably long franchise had some cleverness. We learned things as we went and there were surprises. There was a funhouse notion, like Welles' funhouse in "Lady from Shanghai" which took on some noir personality. Plus there was some folding in the Marx brothers references and the "show" put on by the torturers.

Absolutely none of that here, almost as if it were written by another person.

There's only one scene worth watching: a sexdream of the old clown early in the story and how things are when he awakes.

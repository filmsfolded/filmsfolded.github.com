Spoilers herein.

This is a bad movie. But its not because the basic idea isn't clever. In fact, for many teen movies, the number of good ideas seems to outnumber the good filmmakers.

Modern storytelling is obsessed with, even based upon who is telling the story. In films until 1941, the story was created by some God while we watch. Since then, all sorts of devices have been used shifting and blurring the roles of the writer, viewer and narrator. Here, we think we are observing a simple effect where the characters make up the story for others of the characters. The twist, of course, is that the writers and players get combined. Nothing new here, except the notion of the 'third man,' the artist friend who creates wall art (not unlike movies, no?), mirroring the creation of the film. More: the actor playing the artist is in fact an artist and all the art we see is his! 

This could have been a very good film.

Spoilers herein.

This is as formulaic as it gets except for one thing. The ordinary: a terrific looking girl (with attractive muscular legs) in distress that causes mischief; a ruthless foreign supercrook; an unexpected traitor in the police force; lots of gunbattles, car chases and fuel explosions. A harried police supervisor and the ironpantied hostile administrator.

What's new is that after years and years of white/black cop buddy movies, this is the first successful black/black buddy movie to my knowledge. It works, I think, because these guys play human comedy rather than the demeaning pink-gummed stepenfetchit stuff of say Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Bill Cosby would be proud.  One focus for the comedy comes from that proven device of switching identities and its pretty effective stuff.

Story and tonewise this is halfway between "Repulsion" and "Baise Moi." 

The setup is too simple to satisfy me, but what you look for in this kind of project are two possibilities.

The first has to do with the world that is created, that is inferred offscreen by the events you see. Does the world have a cosmology or mechanisms or gods that intrigue? That's what made "Repulsion" worthwhile. I've seen some cheap European girl revenge things that were cheap and poorly done but which inferred an intriguing world.

This misses on that score.

The other measure is whether the character of focus is intriguing in any way. And this one is. Zoe Lund creates a nearly perfect character before and after. It doesn't demand great acting of the ordinary kind. Instead it requires an ability to project a cinematic innocence. She does this. I liked "May" for the same reason.

It is what I think the "Catwoman" movie aimed for and so failed at. She's terrific. It isn't much as movies go, and the "stylish" last 10 minutes is inept. But she is striking. Now if we could only get today's version of her in a Hal Hartley film.

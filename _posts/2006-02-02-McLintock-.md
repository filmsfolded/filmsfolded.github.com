The nature of the medium is that unlike literature, it places personalities between the essence of the thing and our minds. We actually have tokens on the screen that animate our imaginations.

It is one of the things that has made the form so successful: we get to immerse in the story, but we also immerse in the larger story of the lives and foibles of the actors. Two layers.

So some actors aren't really actors at all in the sense that they could become anything. Ben Kingsley, for instance has famously said his goal is to be able to play any part, male or female, old or young, animate or not.

But we do have something different, actors like Wayne, actors who create a persona in "real" life, advertise it of course, and then carry that same personality into every role. In Wayne's case, it is a particularly odd situation: a warrior who weaseled out of the war, a tough guy who was actually a pillow, a prototypical American who unfortunately hated blacks and Jews.

He's at his best when when he created a role that he thought was him. And that's what we have here, a script commissioned by him, tailored specifically around what he thought was right. Not only right for him, but right and true for the world.

But he's at his worst too when we see just what that is. And as time goes on, it gets more and more nauseating to see what he has brewed.

This is a comedy. It features a few big honest themes: justice for people; a strict, merit- based reward system; honesty in dealings. But all those are trampled by the things that are emphasized and trotted out as equally admirable.

Our hero is a fighter. He'll fight for fun, or out of anger, or even for justice. But fighting is the first impulse. Fighting is admired, respected. He's a good fighter, and even is respected by a formerly fatal enemy.

He's also a drunk. A serious drunk. A stinking, obnoxious, self-medicating drunk who sees himself as merely fun. And that is what he shows us.

He's a cheat. He cheated on his wife when she was there, and he obviously supports a sizable portion of the town's whores. This is of course why his wife left him.

And he's a wifebeater. The climax of this story in fact is a long, drawn out scene where he chases his wife all around town while the town follows and she loses more and more clothing. Finally caught and utterly humiliated, she is beaten with a shovel. (He had previously encouraged his daughter's suitor to do the same thing. that suitor is played by his real son.)

Maureen O'Hara was selected because he had previously (and more seriously) beaten her in a primitive mating ritual (in Ireland) for John Ford.

Oh, and everything I've mentioned is presented as funny, something we should laugh at.

Well, not me. Not this time. And probably not you either.

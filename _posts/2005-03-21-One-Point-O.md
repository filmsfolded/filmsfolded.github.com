My goodness, I see people comparing this to Welles' "Le Proces." That film was characterized by its coherentness: noir fate brought into the story. It was thoroughly aware of its place in film history.

This has none of that coherence, in fact the opposite, a studied confusion.

Look elsewhere, dear viewers, This is a thinly disguised "Barton Fink," yes, down to the girl, the building, the box, the "movie," the cops, the guy next door and most of all, the co-opted written product. There's a thin veneer of science fiction, of "code" and "the game" but where Barton integrates them with the story, these are just pasted on. How sad to be so inferior in so many ways to the original.

Spoilers herein.

One of the most disturbing trends in film is how we have started manufacturing 'special  audience' films. They used to have their own lives, their own authenticity. Here we have a  mindless copy: 'Tootsie' plays basketball. This goes beyond dumb and stereotypical -  both of which are tolerable in movieworld - into demeaning, lastingly demeaning.

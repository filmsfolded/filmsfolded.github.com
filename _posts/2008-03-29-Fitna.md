I suppose there are all sorts of reasons to make a film.

Usually when it is a documentary, as this purports to be, there is an expected nominal bit of exploration of the unknown, sometimes educational. I expected this value because I know the Koran to be so vulnerable. Its questionable origin has been taken to pieces in "Religion Ruins Everything," a recent book.

But this film makes another choice. Its made not for the western viewer who really is curious, but the very Islamist it condemns. Its intended to offend, and the viewer is merely tricked into collaborating. I think I would willingly participate in a much rougher film should someone choose to make one.

But this approach -- to offend for the sake of making offense in front of us -- is something I refuse to participate in.

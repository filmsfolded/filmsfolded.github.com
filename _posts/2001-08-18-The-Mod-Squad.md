Spoilers herein.

Ribisi is rather interesting. In cases like this where neither the writer or the director know what they are doing, it gives the actors a chance to fill in the holes and make their part of the movie the way they want. So because this is a mess, and because it has some young actors that could be talented, its worth watching to see what they do behind the adult's backs.

Ribisi has great control. Reminds me of Young Leo in 'Gilbert Grape,' back when he was a good actor. I haven't seen all his work, just 'Thing you Do,' 'Private Ryan,' 'Suicides (voice),' '60 Seconds,' and 'Gift.' That last one made me sit up and take notice. He clearly likes to show off, and since he's cut some slack here, he pulls some acting tricks: sometimes he does the 'I'm watching with you' trick. Sometimes the 'I'm watching you while moving' trick. Sometimes he dives in and spins up a controlled nervous energy just for fun, to steal the moment.

This doesn't yet make for great acting. But he seems there, committed and aware, and poor Epps is so outclassed. Epps thinks it is enough to act cool street black, which is an act in itself.

I'm a little confused about Ms Danes. She's pretty. She's at least adequate for this sort of thing if played straight.  Though not shouted, her character is a hooker, druggie, street person. Her old boyfriend is a pimp and user. One would have guessed she'd show off too. Instead, she seems to have chosen not to play the character, but to play a bad TeeVee actress playing a less realistic character, in concert with similar decisions in the cinematography and score. That's why they put her in those goofy (really unflattering) pants which in themselves set the stage for the three levels.

But she doesn't deliver on this opportunity. It's too many layers for her to manage at once. How could this be? She was a perfect Juliet in that multileveled production. But on reflection, all the extra dimensions in R+J came from other elements of the process than the acting, in particular the editing, framing and scoring. The director would have wanted straight, but competent actors. And that's how she was cast here, only the directing and all falls flat.

So what we have in Claire I think is a young Michelle Pfeiffer, someone not very committed or intelligent, but who can competently and pleasantly deliver the straight goods for a couple decades.

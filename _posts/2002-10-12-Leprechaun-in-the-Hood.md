Spoilers herein.

This is pure trash. Completely goofy but uncampy production values. Vile racial stereotypes. But you knew that.

But the notion of the devil here is interesting. The Devil is a late invention in Christianity, inherited from east European paganism. But the Irish completely reshaped the catholic church and folded in their own notions. These include guilt, which is another story.

but along the way, their celtic brand of paganism was adopted to fit the new church notions of evil. So nature spirits and imps -- some of them -- became associated with evil. And a very particular type of imp, what we now call the leprechaun, was associated with hoarding greed and selfishness. Mindless action motivated by greed. All this is pretty well understood.

So okay. Along comes a group of filmmakers motivated entirely by mindless greed, in fact motivated by leprechauns. So they trod on our imagination and our sense of stereotypes for a few coins. And guess what the story is about? You got it.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

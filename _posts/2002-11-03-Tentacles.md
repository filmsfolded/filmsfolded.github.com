Spoilers herein.

This is horrible, but you knew that.

It attempts with Jaws what Leone did with Kurosawa and the western, but using another Japanese mainstay, the goofy monster. It fails, but you knew that too.

What you probably also know is that present are some actors who have been in the best films in history. But I'll bet you didn't notice the actress that plays Vicky Gleason. She was in 'Nostalgiah,' possibly the most beautiful film ever made. And she is beautiful as well, a light redhead here. She gets eaten about halfway through it seems. 

In fact, one thing that distinguishes this script is the death toll of innocents. Usually, only undesirables get eaten, or at least people engaged in risky behavior. Not here; a baby is eaten in the first couple minutes.

Think about the story as told through Vicky's eyes (a common Italian convention) and this gets pretty good. It even explains the missing stars in the last half and the abrupt decline in production values. Because she's dead, you see.

I was directed to this after watching the much superior "Leslie Verson." 

That, to my mind, took this notion of a film within and actually did something with it. Here that is not the case. There are two devices only.

Unlike "Leslie," the main device is a "character study." The ordinariness, the strangeness, the shocking otherwordliness of the guy is the whole point. The film within is there primarily to allow this exposure. There is a slow entanglement of the film crew in the deeds, but it seems only there so they can end the film.

I have to admit that the writing is very smart, and the acting -- at least the speaking -- is well done. If you believe that cinema can be made worthwhile by discovering an unexpected soul, then this will be for you. If you want some better shaped experience than just that, you won't find it here.

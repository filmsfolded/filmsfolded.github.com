This is a strange film. Its inept in nearly all respects. Where it is not is in the beauty of key shots. Everything is framed as a still photograph. The stars are Ms Rai and the colorful shop. Each is rather beautiful and colorful. The shop is something rather wonderful; the set designer must be complimented. To underscore that notion of the importance of colored space, that old chestnut the architect is dragged out as the love interest.

The actress is pretty in the beginning and oddly less so later when she tries to be.

Oddly, they used a body double for Ms Rai's tummy, which western viewers would expect to be trim.

The story is an old one: power, usually magic over love, instead of love. There's a choice and invariably it is for love.

Here it has an immigrant twist which hasn't been thought out: the constraints of her craft are crudely conflated with the issues of integrating immigrants.

Even the dreadful Penelope Cruz disaster "Woman on Top" about magical love pepper was better.

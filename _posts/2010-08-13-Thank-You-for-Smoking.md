Reitman impresses. I am supposing we will lose our taste for his approach over time, and he will start to submerge it under conventional emotional forms. He is already well underway with "Up in the Air." So (as with Kevin Smith) we will have to go to the earlier films to see the sharp thing that made us notice. The usual way of describing this as shifting the frame of reference of an ironic form to the ironic side. In this explanation, we've had so much of irony we are able to see anti-irony as irony. The flaw of course is that the term was used wrong. None of this ever was irony unless you redefine the word. Now that would be ironic. A better way of understanding this is as a narrative layering. We come to stories these days less interested in the story than in how it is presented. Even the end of a South Park episode where we are supposed to come back to the real world and get the moral, the delivery is one that reverses the message. I call this narrative folding. Reitman plays with that reversal. He is hardly the first, but he has the best control in terms of disciplined filmmaking. Even here, you can see the safety valve, the emotional fallback. Here it is the on-screen son who does not get the reversal, and his earnest adoration. Reitman will always have this. My latest example, Matt Aselton, walked without this safety net. Also in these things -- at least for a few years -- we will always have a media reminder, a reminder that we are watching a movie. Here it is the fact that our focus is a media performer with the intent of reversing the truth.

Spoilers herein.

This is successful in one dimension. And since few films even have that, perhaps we should celebrate.

What stinks is all the normal mix of what usually makes a film: the story (particularly the humor in the story), the acting, production and so on. But what works is a relative lack of constraint in what happens with the bugs.

The Disney organization established a code which has become dogma. It sets pretty severe constraints on what a cartoon character can do in terms of bending reality or the normalcy of behavior. So Donald might get mad, but he doesn't turn himself inside out. Goofy's nose might get stretched, but he does have a nose. Walt's supposition was that the characters were surrogates for real people and if you break that wall, you bring into question all of the dramatic and comedic conventions he appropriates from real life.

Essentially everyone follows this rule, and has thrived. The alternative world of animated creatures has a predictability to it. Ah, but that wall of expectations is a matter for humor too -- rare humor -- humor of the Marx Brothers variety. And here we have a Lenny Bruce-like piercing of the wall. Its outrageous in just the sort of way that South Park sometimes was.

The Busby Berkeley routines really had me. It ran out of steam well before the end. So just turn it off after the apartment gets destroyed.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

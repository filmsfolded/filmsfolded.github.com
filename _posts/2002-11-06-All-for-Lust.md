Spoilers herein.

I am involved in a study of 'serious' film, but often dive into the nether world of bad movies. I have a hobby of finding something interesting in any film, no matter how bad. This one is my greatest challenge so far.

Quite apart from the normal badness, this film is decidedly non-erotic, and features truly unappealing cows. The transfer to DVD has been directly from tape which produces huge compression artifacts. The production values are as low as it is possible to go, except for the energetic guy with the drum kit.

The story is: three guys screw around on a weekend and one of the women stages a 'Fatal Attraction' type of stalking. As with all films of this ilk, the bad one is the redhead, something that interests me greatly. Why the redhead always?

So what can we say about this that is positive?

-- I was convinced that the caller was the cheated wife and was looking for that twist, when a twist did come from out of the blue from another direction. It didn't matter, but at least it was a mild fold in the dreary plot.

-- The quality of the photography was as bad as home video, with no art or competence whatever. But the editing showed at least some awareness, even though most scenes were shown a couple times. There was some rhythm. Not interesting, but at least it was there. I can only imagine that there is an x-rated version of this where that editing may have more interest,

The way to enjoy things like this is to build your own subnarrative, My preferred one is built around one of the 'girls,' a blond Jamie Lee Curtis type that is the only one not repellant. She plays a special role. She is the first girl encountered at the sex hideaway, and the only one that flirts. She is the girl in room 57, which is also the room later occupied by Sonja, the crazy one. Later, when the guys track down suspects, she is having a 'party' with presumably all the suspects though we only see two.

I surmise that this blond is friends with both wives and that the whole passel of women conspired to set this up once they learned of the bachelor party. The featured wife is the mastermind (the bomb is a fake) and the redhead a loopy dupe. All of a sudden, this gets pretty interesting. Because it is (?) set in Dallas in the early sixties, and because one of the guys is cop, it gives clues to the assassination of JFK.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

More junk for kids. Superficially the most talented folks here were the guys that added the snickersnack sounds of the blades and the crew that composited in all the exploding blood. But there are two things that hold the interest.

One, believe it or not, is the story. It is reversal on the Karate Kid grasshopper pattern. The head guy here was more of a Darth Vader and his top student rebels out of some sense of morality. This is one of the few times we have been reminded that ninja were the bad guys. Though they still have magical powers here, there is the hint that they would rely on treachery over skill. There is of course no suspense regarding the outcome.

But the other is the manner in which the action scenes have been framed for cinema. All these martial art movies emphasize the performance more than the combat. Sometimes the camera gets involved; these things are inherently cinematic which is why we have them. But rarely is there some camera-aware innovation.

A reader put me on to this, otherwise I never would have bothered. Lana Wachowski seems to have had a hand in the middle action sequence. The ones at the beginning and end are ordinary. But the one starting with our young hero escaping from captivity is clearly an experiment by Wachowski and his support team.

You don't need a great movie to have these cinematic advances. "Transformers," and then "Speed Racer" were dumb, as dumb as this, but they added to the visual imagination in ways that matter. In this case, it is all about slicing time, manipulating light in extreme ways and suspending ambiguous causality. 

I almost imagine that this got made in large part as experiment for whatever the Wachowskis do next. They are working for us, and it brightens my day.

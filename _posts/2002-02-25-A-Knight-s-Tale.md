Spoilers herein.

This film is what it is all about: fervent hope that unschooled, unskilled eagerness will pass as a high class act.

It does not -- it is poor filmmaking. But Hollywood is not dumb, and the balance they strike here is pretty interesting:

--rock music, classic to some

--a male Julia Roberts, all smile, thin talent. Hard to believe he got $3 million.

--lightness enough to fit that new category, the dramedy

--a few costumes

--a new (to pop culture) type of combat

They thought that was enough to fool enough people. Guess they were as right as they wanted to be.

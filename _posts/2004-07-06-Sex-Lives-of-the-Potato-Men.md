Spoilers herein.

The odd thing about this disaster is that the filmmaker is as clueless as his hapless  characters. There needs to be some distance: normally the situation is that the filmmaker is  smarter about this than the viewer and both "smarter" than the character. That's the formula.  Not so here.

Spoilers herein.

Usually I celebrate when a film is what it is about. I love that sort of self-reference. But here the movie is aimless, useless, just like all the others.

I checked it out in preparation for seeing 'Waking Life.' I hope this is not a bad sign, and that film has a more alert director.

The idea of these things is so very appealing.

I suppose the genre started with the early Zucker projects that poked fun at disaster movies.

They worked. I think the reason is simple. Some movie genres depend on such outrageous assumptions of the world we enter. When we enter a film, we accept these willingly. because they are comfortably nested in an alternative world, so odd and inexplicable we pay money to enter it.

But if you pull parts of that world out and examine them, they look ridiculous, as ridiculous as a politician's answer to a question would be in actual conversation with a human.

So the very nature of scary movies sets them up to be perfect for this sort of a joke. In the last edition of what will be a long franchise, the control was turned from the Wayons to the Zuckers. And the quality of the thing changed.

It was change for the worse, I think. There are now fewer allusions and they are deeper. So you'll have a whole sequence from Cruise's Mars Invadoer movie for instance. You cannot make fun of its existence if you invest so much in it, so you insert jokes instead of make jokes about the nature of the thing. The Wayons would have mixed elements from many movies in a single scene and you really had to work to get them all. It was better and sharper, I think, movies about movies instead of jokes inserted into copies of movies.

All of these have defecation humor in them, and similar. I think its necessary in a way. Nobody thinks its funny. Look at the one instance here where a young woman has an excruciatingly long and noisy bowel movement in a full church. (She's blind and thinks she is elsewhere.) It goes on so long and is so extreme you know that no one alive, not the most juvenile giggler will stick to the end.

Its deliberate, I think. It sets outer bounds. All the otherwise marginal jokes now seem safe to have our own juvenile giggles over.

The ending of this is something worth seeing by itself, but it is enhanced by slogging through the "War of the Worlds" segments. After being bored by the Cruise imitator, we see him as Cruise visiting an obsequious Ophra. Then we get a cool display, the imitator being as outrageous compared to the real event as it was to the average boring sitdown where the guest celebrity says dull things about their dull lives.

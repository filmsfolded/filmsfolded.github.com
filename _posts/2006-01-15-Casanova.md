Since you'll find this amidst many other comments, you'll already know this is a movie that references charms but has few. That it has madcap without the mad. And that it is about sex but has no urge to move it.

I'll add that it has a clever script, better than "Shakespeare in Love," in my view. That is, except for the implicit folding in "Love," that what you see was written by one of the players. You have that here too, though explicitly and bluntly, nested both as book and play.

But I'll also add that this uses the riches of Venice less well than any film I know (except that bit in "The Italian Job"). Venice is like Barcelona, inherently cinematic, so the filmmaker has to adjust to the intrinsic nature of the place to let it live. See "Wings of a Dove" or the last part of "Italian for Beginners" to see what I mean.

Even with rich fabrics, and a balloon through fireworks, this clumsy director misses it. A shame, because the place alone would have reason enough to recommend the movie. (And I will do that here. The recent "Merchant of Venice" is dreadful Shakespeare, but glorious Venice.)

Oh. There are a couple fun characters: Jeremy Irons until he does his stooges thing. Platt, who seems to be revisiting "Dangerous Beauty." And the blond virgin, who I have never seen before. Everything else is misplaced.

There's a thing about seduction and place that is more powerful than a man can ever summon. A place can tease, can enter you and you it with commingled energies. Life is always a matter of sharing energies first with place and then with others in that place. But only in a few places can one notice it. The place, my love. A man can only beg eloquently. It is the place that seduces.

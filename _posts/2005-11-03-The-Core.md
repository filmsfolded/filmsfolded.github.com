Its hard to judge a movie like this because like many action flicks it aspires to some seriousness in spots. If it did not have Hillary Swank I would just let it go. But there is too much of an attempt to have character development and intercharacter dynamics to just go with the flow.

Needless to say that the attempts at real drama fall flat, say as flat as "Space Cowboys," or "Armageggon," which are low spots for this sort of thing.

That leaves the normal action metrics. Is the situation interesting: the science, the conspiracies, the notion of brilliance and invention? Are the gizmos cool, cool enough to make us want to sit up and lean into the thing? Are the effects mindblowing? Is the pace rush-inducing, at least at times?

For me, the answer is no on all accounts except for one effect: The Golden Gate bridge disintegrates in an insert that seems to have been added late in the game. Some nonsense about the core disrupting the ozone layer in such a way as to produce a travelling laser-like beam of destructive radiation.

Anyway, it gives an excuse to insert this bit which looks and feels like it was done by experts that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.

The core of this movie was damaged.

Normally I value these sorts of complex constructions.

But I got into this appreciation because I believe that they can greatly increase the power of the storytelling. When we have a case where there is clever machinery but no power, I have to examine my assumptions.

The machinery in this case is three stories played by the same actors that overlap in time and space, where two characters have influence over a story from a different story. Finally there is a fold where a narrative stance is created outside all three (actually three plus a tiny extra one at the end). Extra cleverness has all three stories involving film professionals trying to shape stories like the ones we see and having troubles. This is my backyard, understanding these devices and how they work.

But here, not of the power that could come from this connects with the actual humans involved. I believe this is the fault of the writer/director who is a far better writer than a filmmaker. Simple as that.

Or is it?

Cleverness when paraded as the engagement strategy rather than supporting technique is bound to seem sterile, an exercise, an excuse for not understanding the human soul.

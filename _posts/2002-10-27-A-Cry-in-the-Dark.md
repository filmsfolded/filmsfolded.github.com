Spoilers herein.

Meryl is amazing, but this project fails to take off to reach her level. Too bad. The story has potential: Meryl as a great actress acting a character who is a poor actress. The Adventist Bible providing a useless script. The process of 'discovery' amounting to fabrication. 

But to the extent that it works, it does so by skipping around the country through living rooms and bars and many, many other places. It effectively establishes the 'entity' of the Australian people, millions and millions of them arrayed against this woman.

This is an unremarkable adventure until its provenance seeps in. It is extremely well made in all respects, and that's rare enough in that era. And its remarkably western in all its dramatic values, which is quite a shock when you know that Kurosawa was ignored in Japan for being too "Western." Yes, there's some noticeable Kabuki style acting, especially when a comedy sequence is immanent, and when the kidnapper reacts. But it far less pronounced than in nearly any other Japanese film I've seen up to the current period where stylish violence is the basis. But then even the vacant hero's stare is from No.

This is effective, but more than that it is shocking, so western. But this was before the three great Asian wars of the 20th century.

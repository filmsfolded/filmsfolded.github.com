WKW can do nothing less that transcendentally. He turned his brief "Eros" segment into something worth cherishing. 

Now this. I admit to an aversion to music videos. I know some folks think many are are clever, but almost every time I watch one I'm a bit disgusted at the sameness. Its pop art, and the market drivers are going to pound it, shape it into banality. How else to sell?

But this. This has that Doyle touch. They decided to reference, I think, one of the most beautiful films ever made: "Pillow Book."

If you have access to any of WKW's later projects, you need not waste your time with this. But if you are thumbing through music videos, stop here. Turn the dumb music off and watch.

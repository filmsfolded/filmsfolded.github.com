Spoilers herein.

Forget about the story, the ghosts and the acting. All those are deliberately stupid in the name of being artfully bad.

But the house is remarkable.

Since the beginning of film, directors have struggled with how to manage the camera in the context of space. Many types of solutions. Welles made the funhouse a character in 'Lady from Shanghai.' One can see the influence of that, plus the library from 'Ninth Gate' in this 'house.' Polanski is the master of building-centric horror, so naturally he will be a source.

But usually the solutions to space focus on turning the environment into a machine. Even the dreadful 'Waterworld' had that marvelous trimaran.

But the genre gets narrower when the machine is for supernatural purposes as in 'Fifth Element' (on which the set designer worked), 'Stargate' and so on. Just in the last few weeks, I have seen many films whose influence one can see melded here. Three influences: sliding walls, pits, orreries. The construction we have here is a pretty intelligent mix: a machine slides walls to manipulate the action of the theater. The inhabitants actions provide energy for the orrery-like mechanism. That mechanism centers on a pit.

Examples:

--- Sliding walls have a long tradition. Only a few examples come to mind other than Welles' funhouse. 'The Cube'

--- Also we have the influence of orreries. These were originally mechanical models of the heavenly bodies, which over time have come to represent control over heavenly forces. It's the same idea as the guy who can stop time by halting the movement of hands on a certain watch. Orreries are seen in 'Dark Crystal,' 'Hudson Hawk.' 'Tomb Raider.' The version we have here uses counterrotating rings like the machine in 'Contact.'

-- The pit is the least interesting influence, something that is downplayed here. 'Lair of the White Worm' is the purest example. 'Mystery Men's' pit was cool too.

I'd appreciate it if fans of the genre could send me more examples.

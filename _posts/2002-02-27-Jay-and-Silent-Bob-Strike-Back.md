Spoilers herein.

This is one of those rare situations where if you rent the DVD, do not play the second disk of bonus material. Some artists work is much more intelligent and clever than they are, and seeing how stupid and unarticulate they are just ruins it all.

That's because for me, under all the poop, fart, many many gay dick, and doper jokes, there is something very creative going on here. I think the same thing about the Waylons, at least until recently. Here the same dropoff in commitment exists, another case of success ruining the mind.

That clever  underpinning is a free association that moves through different movie worlds in a free association manner as if they were spontaneously generated by us. It is a mindblowing idea, this.

In written and spoken narrative, you can only trigger images that are wholly created by the listener. So free association by an accomplished storyteller means understanding the audience. It's all pull. But movies push. They give the images instead of finding them. That means that a good movie can take you different places than you want to go. And when all those places are other movies (where you've already gone) the palette is much bigger. And to see the filmmaker as a silent observer and commentator while jerking us around is a gas.

So the game is to play a jazz of references, but all in an unfamiliar way. The dopey sex humor is just noise, like the volume of rock music. The real game is going on in the 'music.' This is good, but Mr Kevin has done better. He needs a huge failure to get back on track. Be selfish -- wish that on him.

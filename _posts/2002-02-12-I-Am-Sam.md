Spoilers herein.

This is a very well engineered project, a real lesson in the conceptual end of filmmaking. There are three legs to the strategy: the engineered approach to the acting; the camera stance; and the abstraction of the Beatles.

First the acting. Sean Penn does the richest character work of anyone on film. Usually when a mentally diminished character is portrayed, the actor starts with themselves, then takes away, then dramatizes. The rather crude work of Dustin Hoffman in 'Rainman' is of that type. (The same approach as 'Tootsie.') Juliette Lewis' 'The Other Sister,' is much more interesting because she tries to reduce to the real. But she still starts from herself. The bones of Scientology and theater glitz show through.

Penn is far more intelligent, nearly always working on several stances at once. Instead of starting with himself, he creates the character that Sam would be if he weren't mentally limited. Then he takes away from that. That means playing a character behind the character. But what he does is add the dimension needed to dramatize the elements. The trick is to do this is a way that doesn't show. So he manages all three in three different ways.

What's novel is the pairing with Michelle. She is remarkably one-dimensional. So there is a reversal of the characters: next to Penn, Pfeiffer seems retarded. The rest of the cast is between the two in talent, and that placement of the casting must have been deliberate.

The management of the camera enhances the effect. It is almost exclusively handheld. Instead of back and forth cuts, we have pans. Engages us more intimately, between two of Penn's layers.

But the most clever element is the use of the Beatles in the story. The main thread of the story is ordinary, but the backthread is not. The Beatles defined a reality, which constitutes the world of Weist's character. Adopting this world brings a whole prefabricated fantasy to the story. Sam uses this as a template to explain the world to himself and us. As with the contrast between Penn and Pfeiffer, so too the contrast between the Beatle's originals and the versions we get here which are simplified, watered down, soulless.

Its abstractions are all so well folded and integrated that it has multidimensional body. The whole project can only have started with Penn. Note the deft touch that has him making elaborate origami throughout.

Just on the side: Mary Steenbergen has the most appealing controlled face in the business, and one of the few older women film whose sex appeal has increased

The only thing that is a miss here is the title, and the reference to reading. The shift from 'normal' to 'impaired' intelligence is implicitly equated to the relationship of the real world to Dr. Suess's world. That's not fair, even offensive.

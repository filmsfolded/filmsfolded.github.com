Spoilers herein.

I admit that I was late to the Blair Witch party. The problem was that no one told me I would encounter intelligent ideas here. And that's in large part because few people who see these films get the ideas behind them. I've talked out the first film in the appropriate place. This film is multidimensionally self-referential.

The first intelligent about it is that it is not a sequel of the first film, but a sequel of the phenomenon of the first film: that event where viewers were titilated with the notion that it was fact not fiction: that the drama on film represented real events. That first film played with the difference between film and video technologies but did not develop it (sorry for the pun). Here, that difference becomes the fulcrum for all the mystical happenings. The 35 mm 'film' part of the movie is the element that is haunted, not any person or place. The video is 'true.'

This idea was recently seen in 'Cut,' where the film itself is the beast, manipulating the people who make it who incidentally are the people in it. A more intelligent, involved expression of this was 'Shadow of the Vampire.' What makes 'Book,' interesting is how it merges this central device with two others. (This makes it interesting in spite of the childish references to horror films, the trite script and the immature acting.)

The first of these is the technique of 'framing' a narrative. ('Moulin Rouge' is the champion here, where it is a stage play, within which it is an aria, within which is a novel, within which it is an absynthe vision and on and on.) Here, we have the original book. 'Shadows' was an early term for film, a term still used in some schools. The screenplay is a book about movies and related ideas. Within that we have the movie that starts on screen. Within that, we have another book, one about the first Blair Witch movie. 

At each step of the way, we can believe if we want that everything that follows is a result of artifice of the framing device. So the what we see is being manipulated by the author of the Book of Shadows, and he (she?) creates a lesser goddess who manipulates in a slightly smaller universe.

But wait! The traditional framing is one-dimensional: everything fits within the bigger frame like Russian dolls. But here we have parallel master frames: You could choose to start with the crazy tour leader, who is having a grand hallucination while in the looneybin, leading to the 'broom' factory (get it?), or maybe it starts like 'the Interview' with the sheriff's creation of the truth (he does say that he had the video edited). Or maybe it starts with telepathic control of the goth girl. 

In fact, we have three outer frames that overlap. You gets to choose which one is the path that the film takes to haunt itself. There also is a serial stepping through realms like was masterfully done with 'Ninth Gate.' This starts in the central section where the players/suspects are all together at the factory and they begin reviewing the tapes. So we have the coffin rock deal, the sex vision, the execution vision, the owl eating vision, and so on. These are the nine gates, clearly copied from Polanski. So our three hapless heros advance through stages of awareness and action until they see that their world is one composed entirely of false narrative, like 'Dark City,' or the more complex 'eXistenZ.'

Ideas like this are too precious to waste on untalented producers and viewers. Apparently we have both in this case.

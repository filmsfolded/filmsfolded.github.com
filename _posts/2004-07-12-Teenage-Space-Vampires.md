Spoilers herein.

I make a hobby of folded films. That's where the form and the content overlap in some  interesting way.  The story in this case is a simple twist on the vampire story: vampires  triggered by alien influences pretending to be American small towners.

The movie itself comes to us from Romania, purported origin of the story. (The film was  coproduced by Canadian and Romanian interests.) It does an odd job of pretending to be  American Small towners with an eastern European cast and a smattering of Canadians. Some  voices are dubbed, and many have the accent usually invested in Dracula himself. The alien  monster is as alien to Romania as the fictional Dracula is to London, where these things are  usually set.

I came to this because I am interested in Canadian fantasy and independently redheaded  actresses. The redhead in this case was Lindy Booth, who appears as the blond head  cheerleader, dating the soccer captain. Who knows what she really is, but in later projects  she is red. I think she was made blond here.

Of all film genres, vampire movies exploit redheads the most clearly. That makes it  interesting that this one has neither the three brides, nor any redhead unless you count the  thirty seconds Mihaela Munteanu is on screen.

The production design was the worst part except for the spaceship. The design of the  exterior on the ground was pretty interesting. More organic than anything else in the movie.

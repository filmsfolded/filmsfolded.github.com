Let's be honest about this. The thing is pretty dreadful except for the musical numbers, and only those that the story has presented to us on the stage.

Its an old trick, a show about show people so that we can move back and forth between the two. The sad fact is that Judy is sweet but cannot act. Fred is a lifeless pill when he's not dancing. And the director is so bad he AND Judy got fired from their next movie.

Just imagine that this could have been Minnelli, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse and Judy.

But the staged bits are pretty special. One of these is the "Couple of Swells" tramp number that Judy would adopt as a sort of signature piece (to escape from "Rainbow"). Watch it and you's see Astaire is only a prop.

Another bit was right before that. It features Astaire alone in the foreground in slow motion and the dancers behind him at regular speed. I don't know how it was done but there's a magic to how Astaire makes his clothes sail. It really is a few special moments.

There's a comedy routine that was shoved in. The waiter at a restaurant describes a salad he would make. It is a terrific vaudeville routine, probably much performed. And it shows. Judy sits in front and is genuinely laughing.

This was a period where the blues weighed heavily on her and you can see her weight balloon alarmingly, alternately fat and skinny.

Be forewarned, this isn't a movie at all, not even close. It is a filmed stage show, and a good one.

Regular readers of my comments know I celebrate Spanish-speaking filmmakers, pretty much as a class. Generally, they have good ideas for pushing the cinematic vocabulary. But oddly this is not true of Argentinians. I know of one film that was worth watching, and entire narrative comprised of tango. Part of the interesting thing 'was the mind who thought tango would be capable of such a thing.

This film is about the value of art in a society whose leaders don't value it -- a condition that holds all over the world, the difference being that some regimes value what THEY think is art. I am writing this from a country I am visiting that has good funding for "traditional art" but discourages coloring outside the lines.

Argentines and others have had truly awful governments, but it is not the awfulness of the government that is the focus here, but the goodness of art -- in particular performance art. We see much of this art. Its not plays but folks engaging in improv and social commentary.

And that's just what the movie is too. Normally, especially is a Spanish language film, I would suppose it is a clever folding of itself. But in this case, it is simply that the filmmaker didn't know better, I think.

Others may choose to watch it because it is a political cartoon that came true. But that is a poor excuse to spend time with something and accept it as art. I think perhaps I WOULD have considered tearing down their theater building.

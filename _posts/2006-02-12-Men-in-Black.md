Writing a comment about a Stooges short is a strange business. They are all pretty much the same in the stuff that matters. It's the Laurel and Hardy formula of the destruction of the environment adding in the destruction of each other. 

So when you comment on them, either you need to note some quality of the chaos (invasion of the body), some bit of trivia (what it is the parody of) or some note about the story itself. It's a frustrating business in a way, sort of like trying to say something interesting about a MacDonald's hamburger. Or the weather. 

In this case, it is the story itself we note. Here we are in the thirties, quite early in the life of Stooge shorts but late in the cycle where you could get away with physical humor itself. So we have comedy acts folding in other comedic devices, like parodies of other movies, word jokes, goofs on stereotypes. Audiences of the day would have recognized the movie "Men in White" that was the source of some of the jokes. 

And contemporary audiences would have understood the more pointed joke about the public address system (do they call it that any more?) that wouldn't die.

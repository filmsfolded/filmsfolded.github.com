I suppose studios have genre classifications that would put this as "action," with a (Austalian) patriotic flavor. But my own personal genre classification system has this as a teen stereotype movie. Maybe 20-25% of all movies are of this type, even those featuring adults. I credit John Hughes with refining the idea: the story doesn't matter because it is only there to give these kids some place to be. 

The important thing is that they start out with the distinct types. In this edition we have four boys and four girls, all played by young adults. You have the jokester, the stoner, the jock, the beauty queen and so on. They are interesting to me only in how these stereotypes differ from the American ones I know.

You have the redhead who is experimenting with sex, but instead of being the fiery one, she is reserved. You have the reserved daughter of some fundamentalists who is unique to Australia in my experience. The happy go lucky guy is separate from the stoner, who is the only one of whom they disapprove. The sexy blond here is unaware that she is.

Other differences: they are quick to go camping to an extremely remote, and quite bucolic, place. The war that they encounter is the Indonesian invasion of Australia, justified by forcing Australia to share their natural resources. The kids fight back as kids from movies anywhere are expected to do, but here the two leaders are girls.

This must have been the pilot for a series because some money was spent on effects. But other than noticing the Aussie twists on the seven basic stereotypes, its a waste of time.

I've a special interest in films about films. They come in all varieties, but this is a special case, a film made by the film industry about itself. This is actually made for Congress to plead for the removal of a federal tax. The tax, a heavy 20% was imposed when the movie industry was a monopolistic money machine.

But by the fifties, TeeVee was killing the notion of a night at the movies. It didn't help that the product was crap. So the industry plead to have the tax removed. It portrays the embattled small theater operator as the mainstay of the community: as church, civic center, supporter of the march of dimes, progenitor of all downtown businesses.

This was effective. The very same presentation is now being adapted to save another questionable enterprise "family" farms. This movie was cited in the initial planning for that campaign so the story goes.

So it is interesting in a historical sense, a piece of propaganda using postwar techniques that have since become a fundamental part of the American political process.

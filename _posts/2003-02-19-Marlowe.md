Spoilers herein.

Here we are at the nexus of book meets film meets TeeVee. The Marlowe books were remarkable in their invention of the hardboiled detective: someone who is less a disinterested unraveler than an unhappy victim in the web of fate. The resulting films, especially the Bogart edition, was something more. The noir films were populated by characters who were all acting as someone else. It was a remarkable film achievement because nearly all films are about other films, and now we had characters about other characters as we (suavely) bumbled our way through the entanglements of story and reality.

Then, a generation later, what to do? Switch back to the original model, in a double metareference. So we end up with what would stick as a TeeVee staple - in hundreds of versions - for another generation. It is all about switches, and in this switch, the characters are cardboard again, instead of deep people playing cardboard characters. The lighting is clear and colorful - no hint of noir. And we have our straightahead hardboiled guy back.

It only appears stupid and worthless on the surface.

This would live until Polanski killed it with 'Chinatown.'

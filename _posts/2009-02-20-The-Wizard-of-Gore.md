There are 6 women in this silly thing that get bloody parts pulled out.

Its a completely worthless bunch of cinema, the lowest level of product designed to fill drive-in double features. I have to admit that there is the possibility of a clever idea at the end, but its all so random you can't put anything together.

I suppose its interesting that all six of these women, plus the only other woman in the thing (a waitress who screams) are redheads.

Now normally I would drill into this and purport that there is some significance to this. I surely did with "Peeping Tom," a real movie where all the women were reds. But that was made by someone we know paid attention to every detail (and who had a redheaded lover).

Here, if you listen to the commentary (a commentary!) you'll learn that these were girls he picked up off the street for 20 dollars. Its just an effect of the class and time I suppose. It takes a certain type of woman to agree to stuff chicken parts and fake blood in her mouth and then do her only scene by spitting it out.

But if you reach as I do, even here you will appreciate the slippery way the plot moves in and out of nested realities: shows, created realities, TeeVee, imagined romance, dreams. Its actually cool, but not in the exciting way that Ed Wood's realities bend.

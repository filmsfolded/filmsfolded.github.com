Spoilers herein.

Branaugh is an intelligent director, and intelligent directors today are concerned with simultaneous visions of resonant levels. The standard layers are the story and the modern reflections on the story. Branaugh handles this expertly by casting the effort in noir and then dancing around the form. But that's not new.

What he adds is the simultaneous overlay of time. So he has himself and Emma as filmmakers, them as actors, them as the contemporary characters, and the older characters, each weaving and bobbing in and out of each other. This is the kind of thing that Branaugh does exceedingly well because he can control from both directions, actor pushing multiple characters and director pulling different views and times.

My only problem with the film is the underlying purpose. Branaugh makes some films with the serious intent of moving us. Then he spends a bunch of time just having fun experimenting. We don't get much from this film because the boss isn't very interested in sending us much. And it is a little offensive to open our souls and be ignored.

Also, one mourns the breakup of this great team.

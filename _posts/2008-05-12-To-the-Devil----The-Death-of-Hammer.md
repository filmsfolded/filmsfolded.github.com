Its not common to find a DVD extra that really tells you something.

This one is strange in how cheesy its production is and at the same time how informative. It sent me to find the "100 years of Horror" series which was produced in something of the same way, but will less value.

Here we discover why this movie turned out so rotten. Why the ending was so slapdash; the original ending was deemed too similar to an earlier one. We don't discover much about Ms Kinski, and the way her body became the point of the film. But we do hear the tantalizing bit that they hoped to get both father and daughter, but the father couldn't guarantee more than a week or so drugfree.

I replayed this entire film in my head with him in it, as one of the three male roles: the nun's father, the satanic priest, the investigative journalist. Actually I could see him playing all three roles with significant ambiguity. Oh what a rich thing that would have been, and in fact simply imagining it makes this a better experience than many movies I paid for this year.

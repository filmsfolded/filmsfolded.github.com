Lucy was one of the most gifted comedians to live: her gift was physical skits that ridiculed herself. Bob was similarly gifted, but his gift was the spoken joke. Neither was particularly well suited for the long form farce, which is what this is. 

It is part western, part musical (three numbers) and part romantic comedy. No element of it works. In its day, it was considered a stinker and it still is. Hope's one enjoyable bit was a hide and seek dance with someone who is chasing him. They are back to back but no matter where they look, it is not the right place. I first saw Hope do this in "Star Spangled Rhythm," and I suppose it became something of a trademark over the years.

Lucy at this time was in negotiations for her TeeVee show, which WAS well suited for her talents -- and became the most popular show in history. 

I'll advise you to stay away from this if you are a Lucy fan. I knew it would be bad, but it is on my list to watch because of the plot device. Bob, an actor, plays a guy who is an actor playing a butler who pretends to be an English lord. All this playing is set in a clearly faux western, and needs to be seen in the context of "Annie Get your Gun" of the same year, which is a western show about a western show.

I saw this with "Riders of the Whistling Skull," which I swear I first saw decades ago. It was a movie about movies without self-knowledge. This is the opposite. It is from Hong Kong, possibly the most introspective film source we have (after Barcelona). The story is an Indiana Jones bit, just like the Whistling Skull: a treasure with cryptic clues that needs a woman to translate. 

Isn't that always the way? The men fight and dig and make the rationale, but the women see and know.

The gimmick here is that all the key male characters look like famous kung fu actors. They have similar names as well, and many of the jokes are built on this in the story. This element makes it mildly interesting: the deliberate, overt movie about movies, with as many weaves as can be made, from other movies, references and characters as famous actors (not famous characters).

Francis Ng, who wrote directed and stars, apparently specializes in this.

Pace Wu is lovely.

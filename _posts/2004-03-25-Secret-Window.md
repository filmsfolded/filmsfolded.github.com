Spoilers herein.

According to current thinking, there are only 14 ways to fold a story inside out. Three of  them seem too hard, at least I have never heard of anyone trying. King sticks pretty close  to only two methods, but his genius is that he blurs the mechanics so that you suspect  through the story it may be one of the more interesting methods.

That shows here. The original, ambiguous King ending is kept: Mort is crazy you see. But  thankfully writer/director Koepp takes things in the interim far beyond what King does -  what he is capable of.

The first scene establishes that Mort has multiple selves and experiences a trauma.  That's King. Then we start the movie proper and Koepp takes over. We have the by now  ordinary shot over water up to a house and in the window, then we go down the stair  partway. The stairways shot is directly out of 'Psycho' and in fact that starting sequence  of zooming through the window to a bed was used to begin the 'remake.'

Then dear friends we go directly into a mirror where the entire film takes place. In fact we  see the reversal later in that same mirror when Mort sees only the back of his head.  That's how a mirror would work in a reverse world, reverse.

So what's the folding? The ninth type, in fact the exact type Depp participated in with  'The Ninth Gate:' the story that writes its characters. In this case, the story is the film  itself. The secret window is the mirror and so on.

The question is: is the ending we see the original King ending that is 'bad writing,' or is  it the ending you will worry about in your dreams tonight, the one that still has to be  written?

Depp makes a specialty of folded acting to support folded projects, especially for Gilliam  and Burton. Watch him here as he gives you many layers of the fold without committing  - until that false end - to any of them.

Koepp, by the way, wrote one of the most complex selfreferential films in history: 'Snake  Eyes.' Check it out.

Turtorro has been the reflected self in several projects. The ones that come to mind are  'Cradle will Rock,' 'O Brother,' and 'Illuminata.'

Spoilers herein.

A schizophrenic film. Watching it with the director and writer commentary convinces me that excellence in films is often independent of the intent of the filmmaker.

The stated intent here is to show S&amp;M as a healthy, healing sexual mode, something like homosexuality. I'll not comment on this notion, which seems a little odd especially since these people are depicted as seriously damaged.

No, what fascinates me in film is what I call 'folding.' A type of folding is concerned with HOW the story is told compared to WHAT the story is. There is a particularly robust tradition of folding when it comes to sexual performance: people perform sex in large measure to define themselves. That gives the skilled filmmaker all sorts of opportunity to craft a performance of the performance, to explore the nature of both simultaneously. We saw this in hundreds of projects. 'Moulin Rouge' is a great example. So is the more intuitive 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.'

In those projects, 'Ted's Rule' applies: the 'distance' between the real world (of the viewer) and the world of the film is the same as that between the world of the film to the imagined or created world of the performer within the story. That seems to be a basic limit determined by how our brain is put together. 'Crash' is very similar to some elements of 'Secretary.' In Crash, we watch a bunch of characters who define themselves as performers, whose performances give sexual meaning, definition. The folding is clean in the sense that the story is twisted in precisely the same manner as the telling of the story. Spader manages to exist within this folding both in 'Crash' and 'Sex, Lies' which doubtless is why he is involved here.

Now flash to 'Secretary.' The matter of the story is exotic, potentially deeply nuanced. But the manner of the story is the same rosy approach we have in your typical date movie: girl needs boy, girl and boy get together, some complicating issue appears, issue is resolved and boy and girl live happily ever after. A very strange impedance mismatch which - since there is no hint of irony - makes this stimulatingly incoherent. Not enough to disturb in a useful way, just off-putting.

Gyllenhaal participates in the folding, making her one of the few actresses I know who can do so. She starts out as Gwyneth's Patsy Jefferson and ends as an Emily Watson-like Orlando, complete with final gaze directly at the camera. Some very self-aware acting it seemed. I was impressed with her. But not with the film.

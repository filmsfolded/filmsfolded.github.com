Spoilers herein.

I'm amazed at how many religions of perception there are and how many are effective.  Scott's eye is one I admire, and you can see it in this very first of what he calls 'the long  form.' By this time, Ridley was already the top producer of commercials, possibly a couple  thousand including the celebrated Macintosh bit.

During this period, he developed a technique which served the commercial form, and in its  featurelength incarnation dazzles. Its the notion that the presence of each scene is in the  next scene. Simple storytelling tells you why you are where you are. Masterful storytelling  helps you project into where you will next be. That investment is key.

Despite Scott's claim otherwise on the commentary, the story is incidental. The lushness of  the cinematography isn't central but incidental to the strategy of anticipatory engagement.  As with the characters, one brush carries a lifetime commitment. 'Alien,' 'Runner,'  'Gladiator' all exploit this narrative world view in some way. He's the only one I know who  can pull this off.

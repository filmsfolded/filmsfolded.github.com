I make a special study of films where architectural features (usually buildings) becomes a character. It is an amazingly difficult and rewarding challenge. But what if you reversed it and made a character carry around an environment?

And of course, like many I like the noir film. Those are characterized by a capricious fate that captures hapless humans and tosses them about in various situations that we watch. What if you turned that inside out and endowed a character in the story with this influence?

What if you did both? You'd have something like this film, which is not about Natalie and Bernie, though we see a lot of them. No, this is a noir film about Shelly, but shown from outside the noir environment so you can see the mechanisms, only as characters -- something like gods.

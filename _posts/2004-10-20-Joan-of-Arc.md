Spoilers herein.

I wonder if there is anyone who can view this film with any sort of fondness today. Everything about it is false, with no element one can point to for relief.

Yes it has Ingrid, but as wooden as a pike. Yes it has a powerhouse story, but rendered here lifeless. Even the Jovovich disaster had an energy and even mystery missing here. You can tell we are in trouble from the very first shot: actors acting actorly, staring into space. And that space is almost all painted backdrops.

It may have seemed spectacular in its day. And thanks to the code, it may have even seemed a bit titillating (visions, sex, purity, death). But not now. Simply a disaster, and I'm talking about the 'fully restored' version here.

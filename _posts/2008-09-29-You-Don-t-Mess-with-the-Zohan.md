Only one joke in this worked, for me. Its a doozy and also a metaphor of why this fails so dramatically.

First the joke: Among the many talents of Zohan is his mastery of hackysack. This is the game of tossing a small beanbag around without using your hands. This sport, the only one mentioned, stands in as the competitive monster in the Middle East. It provides a plot point: a Jewish/Arab sack-off that entices a whole section of town away so the real bad guy can do his worst.

So from time to time through the movie you see Zohan practice. The joke is that one of those practices with his two buddies involves keeping a cat aloft. Now the skill in pulling off something like this should not be under-appreciated. Its all in the sounds the cat makes, sounds which convey annoyance and not danger. (The cat is shown immediately after as merely miffed.) I am sure those sounds were created by a comedian and refined many times. It really is a bit of comic genius, original and funny, unlike anything else in the film.

You see. The Adam Sandler films that work for me are the ones that create an alternative world, whose existence and difference with (what we think of as) the real world are funny. The world is funny. Then just existence is a joke that you can embellish, but only slightly lest you break the spell. This is hard to do. It takes work on all fronts and a single mind must reign. Consistency is everything.

Then you have the more common type of comedy. In this model, you get as many jokewriters involved as you can. Its all about gags. Funny thing about humor (Heh.): people don't remember the jokes that don't work, and if you hit a quota they will only remember that "it was funny." I believe that quota has been constant since Laurel was hit by Hardy. So its a volume business.

But these two models fight each other because each gag, each writer cares nothing about the containing world. Its just every gag for itself, chaos. Its the same sort of near-term elbow-pushing politics that this movie tries to disarm and in the process amplify.

Sandler usually can be counted on to anchor a comic world, to be the focus of the comic cosmos. Here, he is just kicked around from gagwriter to gagwriter, mostly juvenile.

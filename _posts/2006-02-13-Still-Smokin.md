I saw this on a double bill with "Downfall." Similar films in a way.

The idea here is that Cheech and Chong play themselves, skit comedians. That they are in Holland is incidental. The setup is there only so that they can do a stage show at the end.

In between we have "imagined" skits. Many of them. And a few of the episodes in the story proper reference the stage. For instance Cheech wants to screw the hotel maid and is (for other reasons) disguised at ET. He hides in the closet amid stuffed animals. It was the only laugh in this whole thing.

Yes, that's right, they have hundreds of jokes and none of them funny.

So you need to be content (if you've been tricked into watching this) with the notions of performance about performance. Every skit has this theme. So in this movie, we'll have a stage show, or a TeeVee show or a movie, each one of which makes fun of another.

The same notion was used in the next generation of stoner movie, "Wayne's World."

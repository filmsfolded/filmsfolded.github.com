Spoilers herein.

More Dallas than Austen this time around, because it is a moneyed project now and not to be trusted to Sharon McGuire again. That's even though she understood the first one deeply enough to make it work. This is more buffoonish and far less endearing; we are constantly put in Hugh Grant's eyes.

As before, there is one really interesting actress in this, but Shirley Henderson has almost nothing to do.

And as before, there is one really terrific piece of writing. You have to remember that the original presentation of the material is as real life, captured in a diary and presented as a book for us to peer into. There's a narrative folding in that presentation.

That fold is impossible to recreate in film so something else was substituted the first time around: the business of identifying with Bridget at the same time we laugh at her. (That's the Austen stance, by the way). This time, we get the American soap opera stance typified by 'Dallas,' where the characters are attractive but no one can identify with them. We laugh at them. Embarrassing insights become mere slapstick.

Here's the good moment, where one of the many writers - or their likely hoards of talented ghosts - crafted the phone call. She's just come back from the esteemed dinner which she screwed up. She's newly broken up so she calls and gets the answering machine. Her message to him is interrupted by him at the door. She makes him wait as she finishes the message as if she is talking to him.

It is only a small part of the project, but an amazing bit of folded narrative. And it has some great dialog as well, worthy of Mamet.

Incidentally, did anyone else notice the eight or nine references to Madonna? Why do that? Is this a new type of product placement?

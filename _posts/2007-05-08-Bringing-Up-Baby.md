Here's a lesson in humor. There are many comedies that some people like and some just think are failures. But when it is a fresh entry, that reasons for liking a film or not are too tied to convention and belonging to be teased out. Here we have a seventy year old comedy.

When it was new, it was so disliked it drove Hepburn out of Hollywood. Hawks, the director was shunned for a while. Hepburn stopped sleeping with and being paraded by Howard Hughes, determined to change her image. Hawks and Grant considered it a disaster and for their next pairing ("His Girl Friday") were careful to get an actress and script that really could carry the weight of a screwball comedy. I'm with them: "Friday" was a masterpiece of screwball: frantic timing and highly abstract situations. This is a disaster in all but one dimension.

And yet there are people today who think this is hilarious. Enough even to place this on several "best of" lists. Its one of the great puzzles in life, this. I mean its a mystery as big as the sun why people laugh in the first place. But why they laugh at different things, just boggles.

In my opinion, Hepburn does a fine job in looking truly attractive in a sugared nutcase sort of way. Her incompetence in handling the character sort of works with her one strength: how to manage what's dangled, what's seductive. But her comic timing is all off, and it throws Grant off too. No one can see what Grant and Russell did in "Friday" in how they established a rhythm that Hawks could extend into the container of the banter, no one can see that and think this worked. 

But they do. The only explanation I have is that we now are used to intended incoherence, and we as moviegoers accepted Kate in her re-engineered state. So we project modern measures back on this.

I didn't laugh. Perhaps you will.

There's an offhand remark at the beginning. Someone is to make a donation of a million dollars. Grant's character says "That's mighty white of them."

Wow.

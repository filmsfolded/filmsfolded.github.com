We watch so many movies that we forget. Its never real, as real as we are. And surely it is never as rich as what we carry in our inner minds and dreams. The most that externally carried stories can offer is to provide contours that we then apply our own stories. What art is all about is negotiating with us, in perhaps the most elaborate dance in existence, to find things that we can accept and also that we can be enticed to use in building these inner stories.

We forget, how much allowance we make, how much artificiality we accept. We accept as real a two dimensional image with elements we know to be fake. We did that a century ago. We accept that certain mannerisms that actors must use to convey selves are somehow similar to what real people use. We accept all sorts of cinematic conventions having to do with structured lighting, assembled scenes and where the placement of the eye makes sense.

Most obviously, we accept certain other conventions: effects, simplicity, closure in the spirit of this negotiation. And in these we encounter strange treaties that previously were acceptable but no longer are. The "overacting" of old movies. Special effects that seem unreal now. Obsolete conventions of beauty, seduction, love, horror.

That's why a visit to Argento is so interesting. When these were new, they were on the edge of what could work, and for a smaller majority. Today, the artistic values and what we are willing to ignore have changed. So with this film, it is more than a film experience; it is an experience about what once was a film experience. Its like visiting a museum of obsolete gods that still beckon. 

Argento never cared about the story except as it gave an excuse for the situations he wants us to see: mood and (for the times) radical violence against women. His compositions have nothing to do with long form narrative, instead are purely episodic. 

The things we don't accept today are the bad acting, stupid story and clumsy effects. It isn't that any of these are closer to the world now, its just that we have made different compromises as intents have evolved. But some of the effects are laughable. All the acting seems execrable. The story is apparently vapid: in fact it is not so. His original idea was to have a ballet school of almost-pubescent girls, and give us David Hamilton with innocent sexual awakening into bewitched death. That is so promising I almost want to contribute to a fund to have dePalma do a correct remake.

In any case, we don't come for that. We come for the visual experience, and that remains classic. He draws exclusively on pure red, blue and green. Much has been made of the tri- color Technicolor print technology, but in fact the colors he chose were not those specified by Technicolor, but slightly off. This gives a shimmer to the colors that you can only see on a big screen with a good print. The first death scene is the most notable and perhaps that is all you should watch. It has no story, only motion, color and shape. 

Is he important? Is this film, probably his most famous?

Yes.

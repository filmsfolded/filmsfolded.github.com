This is sufficiently amusing overall I guess. Its colorful and rhythmic anyway. But it has one device in it that I want to point out. It makes it worth the couple minutes it will take.

Our poor sap needs a job, the situation being circumlocuted. One node in this is us watching our sap which he watches himself on TeeVee. Ted's law applies, in that what's on the tube is as remote from him as he is from us.

In this regard, at least we see that the animator is a lucid artist and worth paying attention to.

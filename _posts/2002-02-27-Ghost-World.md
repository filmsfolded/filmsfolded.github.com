Spoilers herein.

Viewing competent movies is a matter of wearing someone else's world. I've taken to watching them in pairs. The sibling of this film for me today was 'The 400 Blows.' That film was an extremely influential focus on unfocused teen angst. Utterly without irony (which was the main point), it worked very hard to move the world of the film to the 'real' world.

Every film about teens to some extent quotes it, and especially this one. But the New Wave which Truffaut's film began had to collapse, in part because there is no such thing as a real world in film. All worlds are ghost worlds. The game now is largely one of dramatically abstracting in such a way that it seems more real than reality. And almost always, these films are about films and the matter of what constitutes art. Irony is the point now.

Here we have two artists: the creator and the knowledgeable collector. Surrounded by people who cannot understand frozen passion. The plot thread on 'statement' art is the explanation, and Thora and Steve's performance is the matter -- just as if there was a creator and 'collector' in the eye of the camera.

Buscemi is solid, but Thora is very impressive. Much more than in 'American Beauty' where her boredom was boring. Here, she lives in several worlds, some having physical reality, some not. Some in that world between her and us, partly in the film's ether, partly in our recollections of that period.

I'm really impressed. Wish the rest of the production was as controlled and imaginative. It pains me to watch such magic through a dead camera.

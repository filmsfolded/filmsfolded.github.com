Spoilers herein.

It is not unusual for us to be presented with incredibly dumb films, and it is not unusual for them to use the devil (or some surrogate) in some cosmic battle. Carpenter's stuff, Barker's stuff always find an audience. And this movie is about as good as they are, which is to say a 2 on a scale of ten.

What makes this film truly remarkable is that it was made not as a mere opportunity to skim money from the trailer park crowd. Instead, this film is deeply self-referential: The filmmakers themselves are engaged in a battle with the devil and the film is a salvo in that war, the same war depicted in the film.

Part of the shock is that virtually no film today takes itself seriously in every respect, and on that basis alone this film demands that we apply a more rigorous scale. Just on that, this film needs to be slapped hard -- being just ordinarily bad is amplified when you claim the work comes from God.

But add to that the difficulty of the 'truth' that the film relies on. It relies on a notion of fate, and on a use of the Bible which is radically unbiblical, instead subconsiously invented to attract and bind committed members. This specific notion of apocalypse has predicted the end of times within a generation for the last 120 generations!

And on top of that, some numeric monkey business with the text of scripture is employed, which is fine enough for fiction. But the film and the books behind it tie this to Kabbalah. I know something about Kabbalah and can report this is absolutely incorrect. Kabbalah is supposed to be the true word of God, a mystical oral tradition because what was  given to Moses could only be imperfectly and ambiguously translated into the written work. In other words, the secrets of Kabbalah are unbiblical by definition.

If you wish to see an intelligent film based on study of Kabbalah, directed by a first class director, with more competent acting, check out 'The Ninth Gate.' It takes some work in viewing. 

I live down the road from Pat Robertson's Christian film university/broadcasting center/law school. They have billions of dollars behind thousands of students that are working toward films such as 'Code.' What happens when they produce stuff that is not so obviously vapid?

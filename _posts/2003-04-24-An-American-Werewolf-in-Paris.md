Spoilers herein.

I am engaged in a study of film that has given me a long list of 2,000 films to watch. Films appear on that list for various reasons. Usually, no matter how much time has elapsed between listing and viewing I can discern why it was of interest. Not so here. I'm completely baffled. Was it because of Julie Delpy who has been in some of the finest films of all time? (The Three Colors and Godard's King Lear, Sunset.) Those are miraculous films, worth seeing over and over, but her role in them is so minor it seems accidental.

Was it because of a remark I made about Paris being an apt stage for the vampire theater of 'Interview with a Vampire?'? Couldn't be. This is not meant to be an intelligent vampire film like, say 'The Forsaken.' In vain have I scoured my notes and my memory of the experience for any reason someone should watch this. It is not stylish like 'Brides of Dracula' nor self-aware like 'Shadow of the Vampire.'

Vampire films (and this is a vampire movie, just using another costume) are always at least about other vampire films, and sex is unavoidable. But there's such a wild-eyed innocence about this project it takes all the danger out of it. There's one pretty interesting scene that almost redeems it. That scene is the wedding at the end which will be spoiled for you if I describe it. So I won't but it is pretty cinematic. Skip over the rest of the film and go directly to it.

(later) I think I know why this was on the list. Delpy IS supposed to be someone intelligent. Her 'Tell Me' is pretty folded, and this fell onto the list by association. 

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

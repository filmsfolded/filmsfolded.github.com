Nearly all movies are about movies in some way. Some of the best do this explicitly. This is one of the best.

Yes, it is tightly made. Yes, the kids do well, at least the key ones: the designated watchers (Sam and Millie) and the kid from whence the film comes, Fatty. But what makes projects like this work is the structure: here the "Blair Witch" structure where all truth is in the video. We even enter this video before we enter the movie proper.

The big question is whether we will tell. Whether we will allow ourselves to admit that our accidents follow a script, or as one of the murders says: fate.

I don't know how many different varieties of the technique can be invented: of films within films that collapse upon themselves. But for now there is a neverending supply, and of them this is clever and powerful.

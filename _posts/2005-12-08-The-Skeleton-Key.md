One goes into these things expecting southern black magic, spookiness and a twist at the end. You cannot have a supernatural thriller without that twist, so we patiently wait.

Someone apparently innocent will turn out to be a bad guy. Then when it happens, we are supposed to be amazed at the cleverness of it all.

Well, this is a dreary production, with only formulaic suspense to hold us until that twist is twisted. And Ms Hudson isn't up to the task as a real actress would be. But when the twist comes, it is surprisingly effective. I liked it.

That twist employs a device that is specifically engineered for movie success. Movies like this fail if all they do is scare you when you are in your theater seat. The goal is to have you carry a fear out of the theater, so that you will talk about the movie to friends. When the movie is about black magic, the goal is to make it impossible for you to dismiss it.

Scriptwriters, study this. It all starts with this device about questioned belief. Then the writer clearly built a twist around it. Then as a last task built all the up front part to mark time until the real works could be unsprung.

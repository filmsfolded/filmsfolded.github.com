Spoilers herein.

There's an odd reflection between the message of the film and the manner of the film.

Crumb is cast here as the pure artist: obsessed, deeper than he seems, eccentric, influential, unwilling to 'sell out.' And what is supposed to make it interesting is the additional dimension of heavy mental damage in the whole family and touches of sexual perversion. There is an unhealthy aroma of voyerism as we are competently walked through these points -- repeatedly.

I felt dirty and offended. Dirty because of exploiting this man's oddity for my own amusement posing as edification. Offended because it is done in precisely the way that Crumb's art argues against.

I was/am a child of the sixties. Crumb's art played a large part in defining that era, much more than we appreciate and possibly equal to the oft-cited bands. The art was quintessentially psychedelic, moreso than the rehashed art nouveau rambles and garish colors of others. It created a new visual space somewhere between the intimately personal and the accepted abstractions of the time, but a large part of that was accidental. He found his own visions and we built a (counter)culture around them. Why should we be surprised that he is relevant, or at least interesting now? The talking potatohead 'art critics' were a hoot.

If there is a redeeming quality in this film, it is not in what it is, but the tacit appreciation for what it took to make it. Its rather like that documentary on Everest where you know that the crew is going through as much as who you see, and perhaps more.

Perhaps more.

Spoilers herein.

Drudging through this makes us feel like we're wearing concrete shoes. Everything is lifeless, moving with heavy obvious thuds. Each point is pounded. Each character is unable to move.

Hoffman is a waste -- and not just here. The real tragedy is Kidman. I do not know whether she learned to act later, or whether no director took her seriously. But something is amiss here as she is really bad. Class actresses in inept vehicles still shine through -- often they find some space invisible to the director and play with that. But there is nothing apparent from Kidman here. Either she really was kidnapped by moviemaking thugs, or she really was then just a pretty face with nothing else at all.

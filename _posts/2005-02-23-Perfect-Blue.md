I get nearly all my movie recommendations from IMDb readers of my comments. I'm a student of "folding," which often exhibits as a mix of reality, a movie within the movie, or an imagined reality.

Here we have all three in a very clever and engaging mix that could only have been pulled off in the anime format. I actually invested a lot in watching this because once someone goes to the trouble of weaving so many realities, it is common to maintain ambiguities about which is the "true" reality.

In this case, it could be the reality of the teevee show, or of the website, or of the "gaslight" imagined world. Let me advise you not to take this as seriously as I did, because it has a huge copout at the end.

That ending is a scooby-doo explanation where all worlds but the "real" one are taken away. A crazy person in a costume is the villain. I suppose it could be recommended as training in moviewatching sophistication for kids.

In the early thirties, EVERY film that gathered an audience was important. EVERY narrative trick that worked was adopted and manhandled, forming the ancestry of how our dreams become known.

I'm more interested in the detective story than others of this period. But I'm also interested in the contributors to what would become noir. I'm convinced it has its roots in self-reflexive stories, like this one here. In fact this one is quite important because of its prominence. It was a successful stage play before it was a movie, and the movie features the same two lead actors.

The story is folded in a simple way, not complex at all. Only later would the jumps between folds become accepted.

The setup is simple. You have mobsters, already by 1933 mostly an invention of film and radio. They want to murder someone and cannot figure out how. The world's greatest mystery playwright happens to get stranded in their remote hideaway and they force him to "write" a perfect murder that will be accomplished in the movie. See the fold, a writer in a movie writing a movie?

The fold is made more explicit in the way the murder is foiled. I mentioned radio above. Radio was the great medium of the period, not films. Think TeeVee. The way most folks would have received their mob and mystery stories would be through the radio. The plot device here is impossible in real life, but what happens is that the writer (and his fiancé) are locked in a room and turn an ordinary radio into a phone which they use to communicate the story in the opposite direction than usual, it becoming a two-way device.

The fold is underscored by the humor of their guard being in the room and not getting that the radio is really a channel to an audience. So there's a joke between what he knows and what we know the writer does.

Its not all that great as entertainment. Few of these are, but then few films of any era are. But this one gives you some proto narrative DNA, and if you watch for it, it'll meta-titillate. 

Oh, speaking of that, the fiancé is played by Una Merkel who was the roommate in "The Redheaded Woman," just before. One of the precode movie's jokes is that she is rich, stupid, horny and in love with the milquetoast writer.

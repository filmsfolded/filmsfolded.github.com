Spoilers herein.

Christie has a few constants. The first is that she always has someone involved who is in the publishing or performing business. The second is that you can count on her to twist elements of the genre that others don't.

The game is usually a tussle between writer and reader that follows very strict rules that Dame Agatha bends. We are always pleased when she outwits us in a clever way. The book seemed successful to me because of the way it manages all the red herrings  many more than usual.

This adaptation shoehorns them all in, but without finesse. All the clues are there, but are not presented in the relatively fair way Christie does. So we are left with an intrepid crew of four who are surprised at the end with us.

Readers of detective fiction should rebel! Yes, the characters in this TeeVee version are appealing, at least the detectives. But this is far from the mystery puzzle-story that was written.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3  has some interesting elements.

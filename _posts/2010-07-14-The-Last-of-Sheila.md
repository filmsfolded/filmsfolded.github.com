This really does have significant spoilers. See the movie first.

For many people, this would be a mild amusement. 

As I am interested in the tools for imagination accessible to me, I am interested in narrative structure in film. That means that the evolution and elaborations of the noir-mystery family tree is essential to me. Sometimes I watch a film that plays with or advances some concept in this family and find its only value is noting where it fits in the streams that I use.

But this film is actually good as a mystery, as an engaging amusement.

It is a film about film people, assembling to make a film that we discover is the film we see. It is a mystery in which the traditional detective roles are reversed. Usually we would have a lone detective with a closed, captive set of suspects, here on a yacht. Here, the suspects are all turned into detectives to solve a murder of a year previously; the device for this is a game designed by the owner of the yacht, the husband of the murdered woman and the producer of the film-to-be-made. 

While they talk of something to be staged and photographed, and we watch something staged and photographed, the central clue is a photograph that has been carefully staged.

It was written by an actor, based on real mystery games he conducted in his own home, then translated to screen with James Coburn playing the role of the writer. The murderer as it turns out is the writer.

Within this remarkably imaginative structure are all sorts of clever elaborations of the genre. The Christie-Sayers model has one major upset of presumptions and one minor upset through an unrelated disclosure. Here, we have several:

-- the game to uncover the murder of Sheila turns out to not have been so. It was "rewritten" by the writer to be so. (Much is made of the fact that he is at a point in his career where writing is impossible and only rewriting occurs.) Later in the game he rewrites the evidence at the scene.

-- the confessed murderer of the gamemaker -- which happens during the film -- turns out to have been mistaken, but this is discovered too late for her.

-- the murder (of the gamemaker) is not because of anything intended in the game, nor related to the prior murder, but to a completely independent crime committed long before.

-- our special redhead, played in this case by a ditsy Raquel Welch, is the likely suspect. It is revealed that her "secret" was that she stole a garment. The murder occurs on a day in the game focused on her, and the gamemaker (Coburn) when murdered is dressed in a priest's getup, but with a redhead wig and makeup. A major twist comes when we discover that our writer -- who is a ventriloquist (we see his puppets) -- in rewriting the murder scene has used the corpse of the gamemaker as priest as redheaded whore as dummy.

-- the whole thing is unraveled at the end not by a conventional detective, but by the director of the upcoming film who is carefully working out the story he is to film. In the end, the murderer is not arrested as usual, but made to be complicit in the creation of the film we see. Watching a second time, you can see his discomfort in this repeated fold of him re-enacting the story.

Very, very clever. A whole lot of fun, and if you allow it to, it stretches those folding muscles.

What sets this apart from other westerns is the obsessive detail to mechanical story elements. By this time, the genre was about to turn inside out, and the narrative was seeking areas of refined perfection to avoid reinvention.

The genre somehow grabbed this a of strict duality early in its life -- bad and good, honor and dishonor; and as the country adopted the genre for self-definition it perverted the politics.

Here you will experience everything scrupulously in pairs. 2 brothers. 2 pairs of brothers. 2 lovers; 2 pairs of lovers. Two lawmen in town. A pair of men -- the focus of the story -- are in the midst of every one of these couplings. While each small brick of the story is based on these simple tensions, they are put together in a complex fabric.

The fabric is one that is tied up with an introspective device. Its all about stories, who told who what, who is controlling what story and how that control is tragically lost.

The town is controlled not by violence, but stories of control. Encounters -- here they are called "calling out" -- are because someone was told a false story which wants to be promulgated. As a retrospective viewer, It is easy to see in this movie's story, the stress of the stories in the genre, purifying and building and spinning out of control. Very soon after this star packed investment, the rules would tumble, shot in the back.

The appearance of the Holmes stories was a revolution in narrative. The transition to film was tricky enough, but they more or less stand on their own in spite of their rich history. But by this film, the series was pretty much played out.

The story has nothing to do with detection at all, instead some clever protection scheme. Sherlock would never have done such a thing.

We have the complete transformation of Watson from a trusted collaborator to a buffoon, even making a selfreferential comment at the end about being an incompetent actor. And we have a pretty girl.

Its all too sad to see.

The story here is simple. An inadequate, unfilled woman comes to an exotic venue seeking life. She films her situation and that becomes the movie we see -- which is the inadequate actress Hepburn moving into a genre she cannot handle.

She tries as an actress just as her character does: she feigns the passion she so obviously desires, a desire around which she defines herself. She dips in the waters and actually engages in all the motions of passion.

But Hepburn, as is her character, thinly souled and passionless. Her romance fails because she cannot carry it. Same with the movie.

This is yet another film from the period when the industry was subsidized by the US government to make European cities look romantic, as part of the concurrent Marshall Plan. 

It was one of the noblest national efforts in history, to create a modern tourism industry based not on a region's history but on romantic images. Such a thing did not exist before: it is purely a post-war cinematic invention.

Usually the targets were Rome and Paris, hardly considered romantic earlier. Here it is Venice. Seeking David Lean's images of Venice with this intent was my reason to watch Kate. There ARE wonderful films of Venice, at least films that show Venice well. They are worth seeing as a matter of surrounding the place, especially its glass, in preparation for visiting it with someone you love. 

Once. Deeply.

Alas, even though there are all sorts of heavyweights associated with this thing, it won't help your romance, or your vision, or life, or visit. None.

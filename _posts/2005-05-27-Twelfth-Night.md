Lets face it, any film adaptation of Shakespeare will be inadequate in fundamental ways. In this case, you have the translation of language to pure visuals and the necessities of extreme compression.

But his comedies are not like his other stuff; the gags are rooted in visual jokes -- particularly the "woman dressed as a man" routine. (In his day, women were played by boys which adds to the joke.)

This is slight, but for my tastes it captured the spirit of the thing and a couple of the joke scenes. All the sex stuff is missing, which is the big loss, but the players are enderaing even in their exaggerated gesticulating.

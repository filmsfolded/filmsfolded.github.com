Spoilers herein.

Lynch's vision always consists of two worlds, clearly differentiated but enfolded. This has been the case in every project (though very subtle in 'Straight'). In 'Drive,' one world was real, the other imagined. In 'Velvet,' the solution was to pit two film genres against each other.

Here, the two worlds are derived from the King Arthur legend, the source of all magical folding in literature. Every element here is from that legend: the log, the backwards time, the chamber, the ring, the sexual conflict.

The timeframes are folded, from the instant of Lynch's imagining the story during a spoonful of corn, to a few days in the life of the hapless girl, to the 'film/video' time which the investigators (including us) enter and are dissolved. It is all rather clever, but less so than other Lynch voyages to my mind. The one thing that really grabbed me was the prologue: the setup of the initial investigators (who diffuse into the dissolved space between realities) and their own abstraction of the story -- that dancing girl.

That is novel, an invention unique in all filmdom to Lynch. That blue rose is what lasts in my visual memory when all of the relatively artless photography has faded. One example of the artlessness of the vision itself: the blunt device of blue haze when shifting realities. Another: the scan of debris on the floor of the One Eyed Jacks after the night of debauchery. This is extremely watered down Tarkovsky (from 'The Mirror').

That Canadian retreat: The One Eyed Jacks, is a reference to the first modern double reality in film. See my comment of that film ('One Eyed Jacks'), to see the conflict between the creole film worlds of Brando and Kubrick that Lynch inhabits.

I always ask, why did this movie get made? In this case, the answer is easy: Paul Newman wants to 'keep his hand in' to 'exercise his chops.' Paul has been a very fine actor in his later career and what do actors in school value the most? Why it's playing a role where the character is acting. So here we have Paul playing a brilliant old man who is acting brilliantly, using Paul's method.

The whole setup is to allow Paul to explain (and show) how he internalizes until every heartbeat is Sinatra. And you can see him acting his heart out when he's just drooping in the wheelchair. It is worth it for just that, if you are interested in fine acting.

The story is weak but I suspect it was not originally so. In fact, I delayed this review for a week so I could ask around. It seems the original story emphasized Paul's struggle between acting and the sexual attraction of Florentino. Much of the original story was his scheming to get the girl. Apparently, the test groups washed this out and the story was re-edited to be more sting-like. Early reviewers saw a more earthy version.

I was also interested in the director. The first few minutes are masterful, up until the arrival of Paul at the hospital. Thereafter, we have fairly pedestrian pacing. Who is this guy? I was unable to discover, but I imagine him as a quirky film intellectual that Paul selected, and who may disappear for another decade after how the studio hosed this film around.

See it if you honor the art of acting, and can get behind a homeopathic approach, less and less is more and more until you are acting someone acting a stroke victim. Pretty cool to watch.

Artists love politics. All you have to do is work in a repressive society and reference it. And aren't they all repressive from an artist's hungry perspective? 

It can be valuable when the stylistic excesses are novel. I thought "A Taste of Cherry" was enough different that it struck this non-Persian viewer as interesting. Not this. Its been done before and better in every dimension. Are we enriched by seeing a young Iranian thug debase his mother, knowing he isn't acting?

Does it reach us when we see a jilted lover shave her head and show us, knowing it is cultural taboo?

We all have to choose what is real in art. What we allow in and what we allow to change us. Political awareness and "support" of oppressed artists is a different affair.

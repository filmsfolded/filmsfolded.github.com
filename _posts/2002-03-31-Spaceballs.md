Spoilers herein.

I found this remarkably unfunny. Part of the reason, I think is that Brook's humor is unfashionably lowbrow. Part of the reason is that genre spoofs only work when the genre has intrinsic integrity. Only when there is an element of truth in the situation that we find it funny to poke at it. Star Wars has no such integrity -- it is itself a spoof of other genres, mostly westerns.

But there is something interesting in this mess, the woman who plays the robot. We never see her face; her voice is dubbed by the offensive Joan Rivers. But Lorene Yarnell puts on an amazing performance. It is so nuanced -- using many mime devices -- that it acts as a spoof on Spaceballs.

You've got to be in a special space to appreciate this. But it pretty sweet if you can. Unfortunately, I cannot find Ms Yarnell anywhere else.

It used to be that the studios were obligated to round out an evening's entertainment at the moviehouse by providing a few shorts to surround the main "feature."

Some of these were experimental because they were cheap and patron feedback was efficient. Most had some continuing thread, be it persistent characters in cartoons or a continuing story in serials. Into this opportunity Benchley inserted himself, writing and performing in about 80 skits.

He would die the following year.

Nearly all of his projects poked fun at movies or allied media. In this case it is a movie of a joke radio show set up to make a fool of the man. Its what he was best at. I don't think he is very funny when he is the target, but the cumulative effect over years must have been amusing. The one funny bit here is the three guys singing a soprano jingle.

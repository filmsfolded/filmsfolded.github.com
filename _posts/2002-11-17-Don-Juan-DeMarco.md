Spoilers herein.

Its a simple working of a common but clever idea. You have the reality of the viewer, the reality of the film and a separate reality of a character within the film. Here, as with hundreds of others, the third impinges on the second in such a way as to blur the relationship between our reality and that of the film. 

But this time, we have two of the three living actors capable of shifting among all these worlds. Under the foolishness, that's just what they do, though it is hard to tease out behind the rather vapid direction and somewhat silly story. One scene tells all about what masters these are: Brando in bed with popcorn. Here, you can see all sorts of things going on under that childish abandon toward DeMarco's Mexico.

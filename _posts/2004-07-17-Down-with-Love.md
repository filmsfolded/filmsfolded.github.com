Spoilers herein.

I write comments that focus on folding in film. I therefore get many queries - sometimes a  dozen a day - about just what 'folding' is supposed to be. Here's a great example, though  perhaps not a particularly enjoyable movie.

A film can be about other films. That's a fold. Or it can be about the _making_ of films, often  with a fashion magazine surrogate. Or it can be about an actress pretending to be a  character who is pretending to be another character. All these are folds and they are all here.  And. And they are folded together: the writing of the book was just a way to pull love from  the ether of movies that went before into this movie, here masquerading as one of those very  movies that went before. 

At the same time that it is all about pretense, we have the assertion that the pretense is more  real than reality. Love exists everywhere, but we define it for ourselves from movies. Here,  the movie characters define it from Bond and 'Sex' Comedies from the 60s, as well as songs,  TeeVee, books and magazines.

And they chose to get actors with experience in folded characters. Ewan started out with the  master folder, Peter Greenaway in 'Pillow Book' (the film as literally written on the skin of the  actors with many of the ideas we see here) and graduated to 'Moulin Rouge,' a film about a  play about an absinthe vision about a book. Renee got her chops on 'Nurse Betty,' a film  character who believes she is a TeeVee character and has to pretend she is _not_ in order to  join her world.

So with all these intelligent ideas, why is the movie a dud? For the same reason 'Kill Bill' is.  You have to clearly decide ahead of time on what side of the line do the various parties  (viewers, creators, actors, characters) stand. Are they the folders or the folds? Unhappily the  folks in this film want to have it both ways. But as viewers we simply have to be given some  definition. In this case, we are supposed to be clever in understanding the fiction and at the  same time respect the reality of the fiction just like the perfectly named Zip and Catcher.

Can't be both pillow and pillowcase.

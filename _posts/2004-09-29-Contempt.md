Spoilers herein.

Mathematical ideas have an amazing property in their discovery. A good idea can be something truly nourishing if introduced in the right way. Almost never is that the way the idea made its original appearance into the world. Naturally, that is the way mathematical ideas are taught. 

If you are unlucky enough to have learned a key mathematical idea by tracing its history and reproducing the thought paths of its originator (most would say discoverer), then you are given a curse of sorts. You may never escape this history and be able to appreciate the idea unfettered by an alien context.

Film ideas are similar - both deal with abstractions and (usually) visual imagination. 

Here we have a cinematic idea that is rich, even to the point of changing everything that happens afterward, mixed in with two rather lesser and unoriginal ideas about verity. The problem is that by modern standards, the expression of that rich idea bleaches it. Its very invention and presentation is its own undoing.

Folding in film, reflexive anticipatory imagination and myth. An incredibly rich notion that flavors about a third of all films today, with dozens a year more clever and enlightening than this was even in its day.

If you are looking for it, it is here of course. But better to watch Kar-Wai, or Greenaway. Unless of course for some reason (I can imagine none) you really need to know the _history_ of cinematic ideas instead the ideas themselves.

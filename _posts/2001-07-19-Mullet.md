Spoilers herein.

I expect to be one of the few North Americans to see this Australian production as I cannot imagine it being released here. I saw it a block from the Opera House during a visit to Sydney, and found it self-referential in that way where the form of the film reflects its content.

The content involves (mostly) poking fun at a particular type of rural Australian town. It exploits limited provincial vision and superficiality. But it itself has limited provincial vision and superficiality. And the relationship between layers is wholly unintended and artless.

The sister gives a good performance.

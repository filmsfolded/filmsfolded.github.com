You may be interested in a special category of movie: those where a director and the chief actress are lovers. There are many I have in a database I am building. The love is obvious in many of them, but perhaps not as colorfully as here. Judy is a technicolor redhead here and really made very pretty, despite the dated hairdos. 

Oddly, she would never again look as good, not even in the other projects directed by then husband Minnelli.

The construction here is noteworthy. This was the first musical story that had just one reality. Previous musicals either had no story: they were stage shows or embedded stage shows; or they had a separate reality that shifted in and out of the reality of the story.

This was four years before the celebrated "Bicycle Thief" officially announced "neorealism" and at the same time put Italy finally on the cinematic map. Since then, nearly all Italian- American directors have been either obsessed with or unknowingly locked into a character- based "real" Italian style. I consider this the real beginning.

One character, two bodies. Instead of redoing Jo March, they split the character in two. One half was played by an adult Judy acting like an eighteen year old. The other half played by a precocious, lovable brat. As with "Little Women," where all the characters (limited character pieces) add to one grand character, here we have the two.

Judy in fact was half one and half the other, a bicameral curse that would haunt her for years. After this, no one could get the two halves on stage at the same time, and she would consequently never be loved quite the same.

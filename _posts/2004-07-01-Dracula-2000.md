Spoilers herein.

There are three things to look for in a vampire movie: some twist on the cosmology; some  clever, great art direction (scary is optional); and some novel sexual undercurrent, usually  involving redheads and the three brides.

The art direction here is promising for the first ten-fifteen minutes - with the heist and  Plummer. Then it spirals into the cheap, unimaginative and ordinary. Another Mardi Gras  cheat.

The new cosmological twist IS rather clever. But the studio bosses made them take out the  most interesting part: Mina/Mary as the counterpart/doppelganger/alterego to Jesus' Mary.  A little more of 'The Cell' could have saved this element.

These two things were done best by the excellent 'Van Helsing.'

The sex part is worth talking about a bit. There's the watering down for the teenybopper  crowd, slinking and toothy scowling as somehow sexy. We do have the three wives, each of  whom has a few turns when their hair is lit so it seems red. And we have the victim, Mary  who also is often lit red. 

None of these connects with sexuality at a level deep enough to match the myth. The closest  we come  this time is phallic bullets - pretty weak. I actually came to this project because of  Colleen, who seemed to have promise in 'Hair Spray.' A kind of natural, Clara Bow-like  seductive thread that penetrated the lens. Whatever that was is now gone. I feel betrayed.

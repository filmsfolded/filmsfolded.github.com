One of the first decisions a director must make is what stance the camera will have. Then, I suppose in most cases comes the invention of tone, the look, then the style. Plot and character are secondary, which differs from the case of live theater. The existence of the camera transforms all because it can play all sorts of roles, or be bent into several different narrative stances.

Here, the camera is used in an unusual way. One must credit the director, who seems to be intelligent, rather than the cinematographer, whose history is unremarkable. The device is use the camera in exclusive super closeup when dealing with characters, especially the main character. And to contrast that with lush open scenery when filming contrasting action.

It's a gamble, because American filmgoers don't like monologues, and unless one is exploiting a Julia smile or a Mel wink, consider it boring. I suppose they thought that Crowe could carry this experiment. And he does! Crowe is something to watch; he just went from an effort ('Gladiator') where he had to project his dramatic space into large areas. A whole stadium, in fact. Here, his given only few inches in which to work, and the ability to adapt shows a remarkable awareness of the process.

The same cannot be said for poor Meg. Thin talent cannot be hidden by cute perkiness with this camera! And in any case, the story doesn't accommodate the one persona she knows. So watch for how Crowe works the camera, and how this director moves characters as well in and out of his face.

All else is tolerable, except for the score. I recently saw a film ('The Kid') which did with the score roughly what this one does with the camera. Masterful. But here, the score is inept. Danny Elfman has juice, so I suppose communication between director and composer broke down. We know that the director understands open music because as the film ends, he brings on a recent Van Morrison piece. Morrison has a stance with his listener similar to that of the camera here: collaboratively intimate.

Contrast this whole thing with another ransom film with another Aussie, Mel Gibson in 'Ransom.' How ordinary and unfulfilling that was.

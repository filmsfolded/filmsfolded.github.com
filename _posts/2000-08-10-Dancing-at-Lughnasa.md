Story, Cinematics, Art. No, partly, and no.

There is little to say of the story. It is there only to allow us to see the characters, and sufficiently lean to not be noticed.

Of the skill in the presentation, one must marvel at these women. All impress, and one must wonder to what end all this talent is aimed. This is a filmed play, and there is little cinema in it.

Of the art, it may be sufficient to observe fine ensemble acting for its own sake. Then this is your ticket. But other than the repeating of Irish miseries, there doesn't seem to be much attempted. I don't know the play, but I suppose that it worked much more on paganism vs Catholicism, and this is the fulcrum for a rewarding and celebrated experience. All the infrastructure seems to be there. Wonder why they softpedaled it?

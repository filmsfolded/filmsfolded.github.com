Spoilers herein.

What a mess! What we have is a Japanese version of the little prince. He moves from one  place to another by will of the gods. He meets a devil who is not a devil, a witch who is  not a witch and a girl who is not a girl.

Along the way there is some insipid "message" about getting magic when people love  you. There is only one moment that has any visual power: at the end when Unico  temporarily transforms. Otherwise, this is a pandering waste.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- you can find something better to do. with this part of your life

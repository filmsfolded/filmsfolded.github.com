Spoilers herein.

These movies are all cookiecutter projects. There's supposed to be some stuff to occupy  us until the end. In this case, it's Mel's facial expressions. At the end is a running of the  guy to the girl to reconcile whatever problems were created. This must hold the record  though for the import of that journey. Along the way, our man Mel (radical religious  chauvinist) gets his girlfriend rehired, becomes "restored," saves a redhead girl's life,  becomes a Dad again by rescuing his (also redhead) daughter, and finally resolves what  we knew was coming from the very beginning.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

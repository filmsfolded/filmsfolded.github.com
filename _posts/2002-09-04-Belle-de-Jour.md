Spoilers herein.

I have to admit, Bunuel strikes me as unsubtle and unintelligent. Oh give me Tarkovsky, Greenaway, Welles or Kurosawa; these men know the visual mind and weave something worth spending time with. Bunuel, Ken Russell, even John Waters go together as a single type, obvious minds way low on my 'to watch' list.

Here, we have a simple construction: dream and reality generating each other, each as a performance shaped by the unsettling marriage of natural yearning and artificial social convention. We the viewers and often the characters are voyeurs. Bluntly, heavily, exclusively symbolic. Minimal and skillful storytelling within this primitive form. Except for the international pedigree, that fits Ken Russell, and any number of preachers who use film as a vehicle rather than an art.

The construction is so simplistic, even childish that the commentary on the DVD is a hoot. It features a woman with a southern accent reading the symbols for us: 'now she drops the vase, symbolizing ....,' 'now she walks through the frosted glass doors, symbolizing...' as if we were petulant Alabama schoolchildren. The whole enterprise strikes me as a comfortable, bourgeois intellectualism, but there is scant pleasure in this irony.

The art of the film is limited to the narrow appreciation of the minimalism and economy in moving the story ahead. But as mentioned, that story is a merely a flat canvas for a few unoriginal observations on politics and image.

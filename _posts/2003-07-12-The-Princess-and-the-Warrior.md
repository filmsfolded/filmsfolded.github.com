Spoilers herein.

"Run, Lola" is a superb film, and not just a film but an exploration in the malleability of  fate. Here, Tykwer does the exact opposite: explores the immutability of fate, the charm  of coincidence, the grace of predeterminism.

If watching a movie that is just pasted together out of other bits bothers you, this will. I  think it is part of Tywker's plan to use nothing original, so we have Sundance and Thelma  and Nurse Betty and Cuckoo and Deer Hunter and scores of other bits of the collage that  I could see. I can't quite put my finger on where the hanging laundry bit came from,  "Night of the Hunter"? It reinforces the feel of recognized inevitability.

It would have bothered me, were it not for the rather effective character Potente creates.  This is very much in the context of an anti-"Breathless." She hasn't struck me in the past  as someone who can really conjure up a being, but she does so here. Her Sissi is so  endearing that in loving her ourselves, we are placed in the asylum. She spends a few key  scenes on her back, and she uses that intelligently as a connection between the character  and the visual projection of the story. This one goes on my list of films where the off- screen relationship between actress and director clearly adds something for us. I can't  wait to see her in "Tulse Luper."

The story is deceptively simple but has lots of little details, subcoincidences and side  dramas -- more than you can get on first viewing. And that's part of the engineering as  well.

I only know "Lola" and this, but from these two different gems one can see that this man  knows something about how things get assembled in that short path between screen and  mind.

Spoilers herein.

The director is a nothing; the story at the Hardy Boys level. The only reason for this to exist is to get some leading method actors of three generations together.

Brando reinvented film acting, but was already burned out by Â‘62. The Godfather deal was a walk, not an adventure for him. And since then, an empty husk. It is sad to watch him here.

De Niro is a disciple only, not an innovator. He has successfully filled a narrative space a few times, but in the relatively simple case of playing a tough or disturbed guy. He's long over the hill too. Not a matter of burnout in his case, but laziness. De Niro still breaths fire, has good rhythm, but with no magic.

Norton is not only of a new generation agewise, but a practitioner of a new method, one which fills the narrative space with irony, not the direct perspective of the other two. More sustainable because he can reflect us into the space. De Niro depends on putting himself in that space, and he is just not an interesting enough man to fill the dozens and dozens of roles he passes through.

'Fight Club' understood this new method, literally building it into the narrative. The writer and director of this mess have no clue. Brando discovered this on showing up and refused to participate. Both he and De Niro know what is going on and gracefully give Norton leeway.

One sign of a good actor is what he does when the director or writer is so weak. A good one will fill the spaces that the director cannot see with presence that we can. (The best recent example of this in my experience was Gwyneth Paltrow (!) in 'Duets,' directed by her Dad.)

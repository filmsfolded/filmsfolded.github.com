Spoilers herein.

I have had a lot of trouble with this film. When I watch films, I look for two intents: the  intent I observe, and the one I deduce was intended. They are often not the same  because filmmakers are like any other artists; often they work by intuition and don't  explicitly see what they are doing.

I know what I saw. But in this case, I don't know what was intended. That's because we  have a muddle. This is an extraordinary visit to another world, and is transporting on  that basis alone, like ' Heart of Glass.' But we also have the revealed conspiracy of the  pair for sex (and companionship). We have the investigation and hanging. It is just not  clear what the filmmaker had in mind other than following the script.

Here's what I got:

Many films are about films or acting, sometimes in the clothing of 'the con.' Here we  have a story people by actors who convince, and that story is about a character who is an  actor who convinces. He convinces thoroughly until he demands too much of his  audience, and then some of them rebel.

That is a clever manner of folded storytelling: a story about storytelling and why it works:  because life has abandoned us and left us without a narrative as it has gone off to war.

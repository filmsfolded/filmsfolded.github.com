Spoilers herein.

These old porn movies fascinate me by the extent to which they strive to make a 'real' movie. I'm convinced that the people behind some of these were frustrated serious moviemakers who slipped things in that no one notices.

This story is based on the Agatha Christie story originally titled using the only word, the n- word, that is absolutely forbidden today, even in porn. She then renamed it 'Ten Little Indians,' sometimes known as 'Then there were none.' It is a clever twist on the locked room type mystery and the gathering of suspects that usually occurs at the end. In this case, _all_ the suspects were dead.

I doubt there are many viewers who appreciate that Christie was deliberately working on the inside of the genre, that this was known as an inside mystery. And even fewer who relate that to the rather bizarre special effect of an inside ejaculation.

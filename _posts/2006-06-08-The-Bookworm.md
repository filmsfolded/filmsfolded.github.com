Hey, I'll bet you saw this and didn't really think about it.

By this time, there had already been many cartoons that played with the notion that they exist as drawings on a page. So it seemed natural to have cartoon characters co-exist with books.

In this particular one, characters from books come out of them and intermingle, beginning with the three witches from "Hamlet." They task the Raven from the eponymous "book" with getting a worm for their potion.

The central portion of the cartoon is a traditional chase game between the hunter and hunted. I'm sure there are all sorts of interesting societal notions to be drawn from the prevalence of these stories, But what interests me is this wrapper. Its amazingly sophisticated in its abstraction, the humor of abstraction.

The witches are stolen from Disney, "Snow White," I think.

Spoilers herein.

This is a disaster of a film, but it doesn't seem so. It has a few young actors that later went on to undeserving celebrity, so instantly has some interest IT doesn't deserve.

But the curious thing is how superficially it deals with antisemitism.

The first sin in my mind is when a film preaches against something and then engages in that very same thing. It approaches antisemitism as a matter of stereotyping: but does so by trotting out every stereotype in the book (except the gay guy, unless the French teacher counts). It even reaches to bikers in an early scene. No one here is a person: EVERYONE is a stereotype.

Never mind, it keeps on telling us, these guys are privileged creeps and our Brendon is a good guy, see? But Brendon IS a hired gun, brought in only because he was a jock. He DOES inexcusably deny himself. He DOES break enough school rules to get him tossed if he weren't a favored athlete. He DOES fall 'in love' with a girl based on similarly superficial criteria to that being criticized here. (Gosh, is she a bad actress!)

This is the level of social insight we might expect from a high schooler, not a weighty film.

Its all a muddle. The reason we still have prejudice in our society is because -- like here -- we fail to examine it directly. Here it seems oddly conflated with racism.

'Gentleman's Agreement' was a similarly heavihanded, preachy diatribe of no artistic or entertainment value. But it was a whole lot more intelligent and complex in its vision of what antisemitism is.

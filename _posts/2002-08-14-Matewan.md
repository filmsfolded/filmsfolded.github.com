Spoilers herein.

I consider Sayles a minor master, but not for this. 'Limbo' and 'Lone Star' are much more complex films in their structure. They reference memory, the angst of vision, and emptiness of creation. They are ambitious and every bit as lovely as this.

Here, I think Sayles decided he would attempt something simple and master it utterly, using 'How Green Was My Valley' as a template. As there, so here. The situation is two dimensional with the bad guys and the salt-of-the-earth innocents. The development of the story is entirely linear with various enobling events. As there, so here with the director finding the most artistic Hollywood cinematographer in Wexler (as did John Ford with Arthur Miller). In both cases, the lighting is ethereal, placing these artificially gritty folks in a sort of Disneyland coal town.

It is a remarkably simple morality play, but Sayles does indeed envelop it entirely. He has a special skill in visual narrative continuity. The motion of the dialog, the movement of the actors and the movement of the camera eye all continue from one set of scenes to another as visual phrases. I know no one else who does this so well with these three factors.

As an aside, the situation of West Virginia is odd. It is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and as with Arabia, West Virginia should have elevated a largely illiterate populace to grand wealth and the foibles that come with it. Instead, essentially the rest of the country has conspired to take for ourselves without giving back, like we grandly subsidize Alaska. Here, Sayles mines this sad history for our comfortable, warm moralizing. Is it much different?

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth Watching.

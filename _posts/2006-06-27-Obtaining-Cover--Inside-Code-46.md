I don't often ask people to stay away from any film. And generally it is a good idea to hear what the artists involved in a project have to say about it.

But the movie in question, "Code 46" is so ephemeral, delicate and disturbing...

And what these people say is so banal, stupid and obvious, you feel as it they all, every one, were given the memory-erasing virus that makes them forget the passion they had and quietly placed in submerged places.

If you see this, you will think the movie is something it is not.

I can just imagine the letters I will get. But sometimes the last people who know what power their art has is the artists themselves. 

Its true. Its what the movie in question is about. And the example is here almost as if this were done deliberately.

Spoilers herein.

I only know a dozen or fewer Rohmers, but to my mind this is the best. It is because of the self-referential plot, where the writer of the film is a character. It is typical Rohmer, but more clever than usual. Within the double-written story is an embedded fantasy (about the sublime knee).

You need to completely relax when sharing these films. They are meditations which encompass illustrated essays. The actors are horrid, but so understated that it works. Just like the sensual but overexposed photography. It all underscores the highly abstract nature of the space, and that is its greatest virtue. Very little moves within a scene, and there is little art in the transition between scenes. The transporting is all in the stillness.

And that allows you, if you are so inclined, to fill in the visions as if it were facilitated radio. Along the way in this film, I actually became obsessed myself. This man is special, and I do not know what I will do when he stops making white space as my cinematic anchor.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

When the moving picture was invented, there was a solid chance that it would inherit the notion of art from photography. That in turn was inherited from "easel" painting: image first, directly appealing to the senses with narrative way down the list.

Then came the (to my mind) disaster of "Birth of a Nation" which tipped the parentage of film art from painting to theater. Thereafter in nearly all cases, movies were first about storytelling.

But a remnant of the previous family tree remains and sometimes can be found in so-called "art" films. Before they became a completely separate beast with talkies, we had examples like this. This film is literally a case of direct sense versus the bad, bad thing film was becoming -- in other words, flesh and the devil.

The story itself mirrors the conflict by placing it (somewhat clumsily) as a conflict between two friends who both love the same woman, played by Garbo. 

The entire production is a matter of extremely powerful images that register as images first and only then elucidate a story. In the plot, the lovely woman is destroyed and the two friends reconcile. Not so in the real world of the future of cinema.

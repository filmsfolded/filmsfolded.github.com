Spoilers herein.

Bruce Willis out-Eastwoods Clint Eastwood. Where Clint directly references the movie, Willis directly references the reference. That is the only point of such projects, all the rest is filler meant to establish a general color within the world we visit. That's why these films are so noisy and graphic. Usually, that's all you can say, but in this case we get more.

This film focuses on faces. There are a huge number of supercloseups, the actors were clearly chosen for their appearance (certainly not acting), the setting is Africa so we also get some richness in the faces of extras. My own impression is that the extras do not represent the region or have anything to do with it - ethnic identity is eschewed in the name of variety of features. This is one of those rare moments when a film actually practices what it preaches.

More. The scenes between facial closeups have a distinct rhythm. All pauses are on faces, every in-between motion sets up a closeup, with closeups annotating throughout. A very, steady beat slowly building then continuous, orgasmic afterglow at the end. 

The last time I noted this technique was in 'Proof of Life' where it was used to transition between the confinement and open wilderness. The notion of a facial likeness (the 'proof') gave an excuse. A clever construction inexpertly managed. Here, the closeups are used in a simpler, subtler way. It is expertly done, if you can see you way through all the 'white man's burden' mythology.

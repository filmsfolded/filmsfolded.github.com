What a mess. There may be some fashion in camerawork that I'm missing. But never mind as the point of the film seems to be in its story, and that is a great failure. 

Mathematics is not arithmetic, even the mathematics of numbers. Patterns are, well, patterns, not characterizable by a number, or any numbers for that matter. Kabbalah is not Gematria -- the latter is for schoolchildren and astrologers; virtual schoolchildren. Kabbalah is deeply group theoretic. None of this has much to do with computers. If there was a group interested in insights it would be the marmalade crowd at NSA. At least 'Good Will' got THAT part right.

Believe me, there is a very interesting film with ideas roughly proximate to this. That's why this is such a shame.

Over time, and with the intercession of countless film school professors, the notion of "surreal" has morphed from something living to something dead, shelved.

The original context was no context, the rejection of context. The rejection of explanation and meaning, at least of the sort that was then current. Well, not quite. These guys followed the real anarchists of imagination and started inserting things that really did have substance, effect.

They relied on the scientific view of the time, one of them, about the nature of cognition. Its a quaint notion now, that images somehow float in the dream zone of the brain, loaded with power but no meaning. Once awake, the hidden Nazi in each of us arrays these image pieces into a sort of order, but one that is artificial, saps the objects of much of their power and prevents us as beings from being free and rich.

(I use the term, "Nazi," deliberately, as the Spanish rural imagination viewing what was then a largely German-lead notion of cosmological structure.) Dali would water this down based on what worked commercially. Similarly, Bunuel would also in his own way accommodate narrative to "make a point" about the value of not making a point. So this (and the next) are about as pure as we will get of the fresh notion of image insertion into our minds without a narrative wrapper.

Its a curious artifact of history. That notion of cognition has been discarded as we've learned that cognition works in exactly the reverse dynamic that they preferred: its all narrative with images and symbols along for the ride. So if you appreciate this, it should be neither for what it means (as it means nothing), nor as a deep artistic experience (unless you consider essays art), but rather as one of the political movements that brought us to where we are today with Spanish-speaking filmmakers.

We are all enriched by these guys and their notions of parallel narratives, often called magical. Its where the seat of the cinematic soul is now. If you hold that everything that took you to a celebrated place should be celebrated, then you'll like this.

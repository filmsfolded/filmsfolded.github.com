Spoilers herein.

This was on two of my lists. One list was the 'search for a decent Askew film.' The other was the 'lead actresses who sleep with the director' pile.

As far as the Kevin Smith quest goes, I have now seen them all. I can see him trying every approach and not really innovating in any of them. I suppose this is the most conventionally competent, which is a shame since the writing (but not the filmmaking) of 'Clerks' had some clever ideas: 37 episodes as blow jobs; structure of 'The Divine Comedy;' sex death and pathos.

The frame here is a simple love story. The twists are gayness and it doesn't work out. Guinevere Turner's 'Go Fish' was more raw. She's the woman who calls Alyssa up to sing.

Smith just touches on the self-referential comicbook device only briefly. Sad, because that's where his genius could have been.

Demme is another of our filmmakers who really thinks about how to affect us through the eye.

Yes, we have an engaging character, engagingly played. Yes, we have some puzzling social compositions having to do with strange perturbations of the ceremony we usually see in film. Yes, we have a story recalled rather than shown.

But what made this important to me is the decision the filmmaker made to use the camera the way he did. 

We are pretty used to the persistent, hand-held camera by now. Soderbergh and Aronofsky work with it in probing, extrahuman ways. But this is different. We know home movies, and we know that every wedding now has a video, in fact many videos that follow and capture. We've seen dozens of these and know from them that what we see is real. It is not a movie; it is captured reality, real people whose foibles cannot be hidden.

What Demme has done from the very first frames, is slide us into this mode where it seems that this is a real wedding, with accidental visibility. We even have in the thing a designated character who is always filming, lest we forget that this is the dynamic we have. That man -- a soldier temporarily back from one of our wars -- is told three times that we would like him home permanently so that we know he is a visitor, our surrogate.

The shots are mostly as we would take if we were there: long shots following people around. Shots that capture what is interesting but with obviously accidental framing. Staging that emphasizes the space but which seems to discover it instead of present something that was engineered to be seen.

It works. Its good. You should see it and look beyond the acting. There's some smart, smart visual thinking here and it needs to be celebrated.

There is one shot early in the thing where the cinematographer lets us know he is there. It is a long scene that follows Kym through the house. Where everything else is shot as we would, from eye level, this starts right on the floor and over three minutes or so slowly moves to eye level. Oh, hello Declan of "Vanya on 42nd Street" fame; yes, we see you.

Hathaway does a good job, but the character is easy. She did a better job in "Brokeback" where she created something new, complex and original in just a few minutes.

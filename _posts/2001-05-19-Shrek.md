Spoilers herein.

Why was this film made? To humble Disney/Pixar -- and it shows in the deeply self-referential story.

The villain is the dwarf Eisner. His kingdom is Disneyland, newly berift of the legacy characters. And he dearly needs to be king, but won't be.

Strangely, for his first truly big battle with Disney, Katzenberg copies 'Beauty and the Beast,' in all important particulars. So in addition to being a film whose story is about itself, it is a film which battles itself.

With all this baggage, it was likely to fail, and it does. Compare this to the recent 'Spy Kids,' to see better imagination, better charm, better pacing.

Spoilers herein.

Wars are fought so that people (usually an elite) can feel better about themselves. In modern (democratic, media-driven) nations movies play a large role in defining what those values are and who deserves them.

Hollywood and the military have, since WWII, had a mutually beneficial partnership. Hollywood gets to use war machines if they deliver the 'right' message. Here is one of the best examples we have, rivalled by 'Top Gun,' because it has nothing at all but those two elements.

The reason we watch films like this is for the experience on ship and aloft in the neat gizmos. Nominally, these belong to the citizenry and exist on its behalf, but constitute an abstract world that in 1955 was as remote as that of Star Wars 25 years later. The element that is the attraction (rather than the 'commercial' of the film) is the exposure to the carrier and the various dramas associated with war flight. In its day, this footage was startling. (It requires an odd use of the disembodied loudspeaker to tell the viewers what is going on.)

The other half of the film is the message: the US citizens are ignorant of the greater threat, complacently sleeping while evil is at work. Grace Kelly (who would retire into precisely this protected situation) dutifully and charmlessly does the job as surrogate for US women.

The surrogate for men is a more interesting situation because the passing of time has goofed this up. 1955 was a time when one could actually think of a lawyer as honorable and representative of typical American wholesomeness. What a hoot this is today. Anyway, Holden plays the solid citizen-soldier who gets killed. It its day, this was a strong statement, one that underscored that sacrifice was required.

Students of war films will note the radical shift away from blatant racism. The yellow maniacs of WWII have been replaced. Here, the North Koreans and Chinese are faceless clients of the greater evil, Russians. The Japanese are played as friendly resource, here as a cache of lovely women. Check out 'Sayanora' of the following year, a nuanced milestone in the evolution of Japanese-specific racial attitudes.

The end has the famous scene of the Captain wondering where these men come from. Movies create them in society, that's where they come from.

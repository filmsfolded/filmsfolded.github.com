Sometimes the idea of a movie is stronger than the movie itself, but we allow the movie to make noise while we pleasantly think about what is happening. I think that is what is going on here. The actual thing is unremarkable, ordinary in fact. I'll go further and say its pedestrian. Of course that's the point, that we should be looking at and celebrating sidewalk cracks.

The idea is the thing. You have a life. You have a comic of a life. You have a movie, which is all three, movie, comic, life plus a retrospective of life. 

One device is the gawking at damaged humans. Ho hum. There is some safety provided when our hero (both the actor and the real character) get upset about the privileged doing just this gawking, while we gawk at the upset.

The other device is the one that is supposed to sustain us, the folding of the three layers, and some interaction among the three. But it is so slight, that interaction, that it seems that except in only one case, the writers decided to run away from it. That one instance is that our man gets sick and wonders if the comic will die with him. The idea IS indeed enough to sustain interest, but afterwards we feel cheated.

The one really interesting idea concerns a character we see at the beginning, R Crumb. There is a movie made about him that's not very engaging. The character as displayed here is pretty darn engaging, though.

One joke mattered: a woman, a fan of the comics calls him, and meets him at the bus station. That evening they would get engaged, but while she is looking for him, she imagines all the images she has of them. He writes comics about himself, but they are drawn by different artists, so his "appearance" varies from monster to "young Marlon Brando." She imagines each being. When presented with the embodiment, it doesn't matter.

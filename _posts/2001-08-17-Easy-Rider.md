Spoilers herein.

Some of the greatest minds in Hollywood at the time: brilliant because they were stoned, a brilliant film about being stoned.

The first real American independent film. The first film to affect culture as counterculture. The most honest performances of their careers from Nicholson, Hooper, Fonda.

Jimi, Bob, the Byrds, the Band as they intended. 

Films routinely invent life today, but you really had to be there to know the impact of this film. I was.

The 'summer' of love started in Â‘67 with Sgt Pepper and ended with this film. That's because these guys were not into love. They were not into revolutions or spiritual voyages -- not even into Brando-type rebellion, which had its own honor.

These were no merry pranksters, instead selfishly free cowboys, an archetype now coopted by the country music business. This is what killed the revolution (together with Yoko). At least we freed American film to be art. It all starts here folks, on the blood of the flowers.

This reminds me to look into Karen Black. Seems she's into the self-referential surrealist expression thing -- knows what she's doing.

After this: 'Thelma and Louise' meets 'Fear and Loathing in LV.'

This is so unremarkable as a film to be worth avoiding. 

But there is something interesting about it. 

There is a social compact any film makes with its viewers that sets the narrative conventions. Quite separately, viewers of another kind want to simply be entertained with music, dance and often jokes. How these relate to narrative is not trivial and over time some clever techniques and conventions have been developed.

You can have the world of the film be designed so that people just burst into song to move the narrative.

You can have people sing to each other, usually with endearment

You can have shows within that simply are nested, so the main story stops while we watch the show. 

This movie has every technique that had been developed up until that time, mixed helter skelter. There are at least four inner types of show, for instance: a church choir; a home town show; a night club act (Nat King Cole) that characters visit; and a night club act that includes a character.

You have songs within the story itself and about the story. You even have a character who wants to be in show business so dances in real life, in imagined shows and in two variations in between.

The whole mix is challenging and requires the viewer to participate in maintaining an interactive fictional foreground that shifts unexpectedly.

This plot was later re-used in the Andy Griffith Show of January 15th, 1962 used this plot and long before, Don Knott's deputy character drew from the deputy here: Happy, played by Chill Wills.

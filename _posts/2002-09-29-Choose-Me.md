Spoilers herein.

In preparation for this, I rewatched Bujold's first real film role in 'War is Over,' an amazing film about the continuous, risky journey of the unattached toward meaning. Even then, one knew that we would have a lasting icon for the self-curious mystery of woman. Since, we have had her in few interesting roles.

Here we have a quirky little piece of ensemble talking angst punctuated by bedroom farce. And in the midst of it, we have this hypnotizing creature both as the actress and the character, in fact one gets the feeling that the relationship between the woman and her character(s) is much like the relationship between Ann and Dr. Nancy Love. Performing fills this woman with a charm that will fade from only a few men's dreams. Doesn't happen often.

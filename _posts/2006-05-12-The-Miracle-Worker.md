The relationship between the stage and the screen is uneasy. Superficially, they are siblings and many artists move between the two effortlessly. Often, a successful work in one jumps to the other well enough.

When the jumper is a play, sometimes what you end up with is a filmed play, with film playing no more of an additive role than if it were filming a sporting event. That's what we have here: the creative team from a successful play transported wholesale from the stage to nitrate.

The odd thing is that many viewers don't care about the difference, don't notice it even though the acting styles are quite different. And the stagecraft.

Not me. I yearn to have the visual fairies and demons of cinema let loose in my mind. I need to have the nourishment in that dimension. Otherwise I feel, well, blind.

The 2000 Disney TeeVee version was paler in terms of thrashing and mugging, but I think I prefer it as a more living thing. 

(I admit that for me Anne Bancroft brings down every project she is in. She has this odd manner, this device where she isn't the character so much as the theatrically carried motions of the character without the emotions.)

The only mildly interesting thing that I can recommend in this is to combine it with several later Arthur Penn films and see how he learns what cinema is all about. Within five years he fully understood the medium and was able to produce a US perspective on French new wave film-making that references gangster pictures from the 30's. He was brilliant there and afterward.

Not here. Here everything is spelled out for us without the touch.

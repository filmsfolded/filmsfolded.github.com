Spoilers herein.

This has two things to recommend it.

First is the writing. David Mamet is the crackerjack writer today, period. Anyone in the film business knows Kurosawa. Anyone in the writing business knows the 'Yojimbo' trick of twisting the narrative based on which of the two warring forces is capriciously focused on. Here, Mamet follows that template with novelty and reverence, even to the point of allowing each warrior his/her own reality.

He even creates the obligatory play within the play in a clever way by inserting a fellow who creates complex 'models' of samurai, with comment. More, he mirrors that 'show' with the ice skater, who gives her life for her boss. The direction doesn't equal the writing, alas. But this is as clever as a spy thriller has thus far gotten.

The other good thing is the final car chase. Mamet of course had nothing to do with the chase scenes. But the first one really was by the book: see the fish stand, see the first car, see the fish close up, see the car plow through the fish stand, see the vendors gather round in dismay, see the second car plow through the mess. If this was Kurosawa, we could be assured this was parody. Here I think not.

DeNiro is less obnoxious than he has been for four years on either side of this film, perhaps because he knew the script was over his head. Natascha McElhone is the winner here, just in her carriage. She looks and acts like an Uma done right. Maybe we won't have to wait for Sarah Polley after all. She completely stunned in Branagh's recent Shakespearean musical comedy. Someone to watch.

The score was dreadful. The worst.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- has some interesting elements

Sometimes it is the idea of a movie that has value, but to get that idea, you have to suffer through a really bad show.

Ostensibly, this is a story about a tough, retired French commando. (Note to rest of world: within France, these guys are considered to be tougher than special forces in the rest of the world, probably because the "regular" French armed forces are so universally thought to be wussy.) He goes to Japan and tussles with the local mafia boss. It is a pastiche of tropes and unamusing.

But if you sit through it, you begin to wonder at what it is. Its existence is a fascinating thing. It isn't something that makes sense at all, and seems to be -- if it is not completely random -- the product of a clever mind. The genre was created by Hollywood and then adopted in the third generation by Besson who with great care did to it what Leone did to the western. Its is an anti-ironic twist, taking the ironic, self-mocking attitude from Hollywood and mapping it to something the filmmaker takes quite seriously. All well and good.

But then transporting the genre one more cultural fold to Japan? Without the slightest nod to any Japanese cinematic notions? Keeping the style as it came from Hollywood and the seriousness from France? No wonder the man couldn't taste the wasabi.

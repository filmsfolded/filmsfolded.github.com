From time to time I escape to South Park. Sometimes they are brilliant. But It seems that they only became so after many years and they decided to focus more on big stuff. These early ones are a whole different beast, still self-absorbed in the nature of what they are and not yet prepared to fully take on the world. 

I don't know when the threshold was reached where these things changed from being a collection of inside jokes only to full Jonathan Swift level satire and even battles with stupidity and evil.

But it was well after this.

Spoilers herein.

Buñuel is clearly hit and miss. What's interesting is that different people consider different films hits. This is perhaps his most widely appreciated, but I found it uninteresting. The arc is a report from a man on mutual attempts at exploitation that are never achieved.

For me, Buñuel is the strongest symbolic minimalist, someone who reduces the world to very few stalks of emotion and weaves them with extreme attention to poetic resonance. The camera is simply a display device. The poetry is all abstract: grates for emotional separation for instance. Everything is envisioned first as a clear conflict -- I imagine it beginning as a simple diagram. Then he writes, and for him, writing is dialog. There are very few real images in his films, and of course those images are meant to have symbolic power as a result. Everything is obvious, clear, spoonfed. He's Rohmer except where Rohmer has situational irony, Buñuel's is symbolic.

Spanish filmmakers are no more vexing than other Europeans, but they seem to be only of three types: those that exploit Borges-like reflexiveness; those who wallow in the purported free-spiritedness of the sexual encounter, and those who merge the two. I find Ruiz a success, Medem as well with Almodóvar promising. Buñuel is only of historic interest, a cinematic draftsman.

Spoilers herein.

Eddie Murphy has had one great role, "Bowfinger." There and in fragments of other  movies he's proven (to me) to be the best of the crop of black comedic actors since  Richard Prior blew his mind. But his ability as an actor is very narrow; usually he is  reduced to impressions. 

It must be really hard for him to find vehicles. This one was a huge mistake. This  character needs to be near the center of the reason for the story. He's a Jerry Lewis type  actor, and needs the integration of his goofy character with a similar goofy story. Missed  the religion here.

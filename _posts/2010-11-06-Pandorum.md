How much responsibility can the writer carry? Almost always when I go into a film, I expect to be engaged in sharing a world with the filmmaker. This is because so many of the ways I connect are cinematic, which is to say extralogical. It is the filmmaker that carries the spirit away.

A good film requires a good writer; there is no escaping that. There are films where the filmmaking is merely competent and the writing extraordinary. "Adaptation" is one of these. But in that case, I believe the writer conceived the thing cinematically. His screen notes were sparse but the vision was built into the thing, so he is the filmmaker in my mind.

In "Pandorum" we have an amazing collection of ideas, just hypnotizingly clever. I left this wanting to meet the guy who wrote it. Unlike most science fiction, there is more than one idea. And one of them is an untwisted narrator who places us in a quiet delirium for the first two thirds. Then just as we are adjusting to that, we have another context shift of massive proportions. 

The setting is perfect for this sort of surprise because the elements are so ordinary: your traditional mysteriously damaged space ship with onboard monsters. The design of the ship is adequate. The special effects are well within acceptable limits. The acting is fine. The babe does her job. 

But the thing is a massive disaster. Just massive. Unwatchable. Part of the problem is that there is no pacing, no rhythm. It is all chase and panic and nothing could be more boring. The twists are there but not built into the images; they just happen, to be discovered shortly thereafter. There is no rest for the eyes so that we can absorb the complex story.

Could the writer have prevented this? Is it his responsibility? Is it possible for the writer to provide a path from us to him/her that tunnels under incompetent filmmaking? Something other than soap opera?

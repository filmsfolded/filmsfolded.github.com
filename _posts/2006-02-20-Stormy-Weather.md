This is Black History month here in the US, usually prompting all sorts of controversial behavior. What I've been doing is watching films that feature blacks, old films from a time when heavy oppression was on the land, but a strong black middle class existed.

"Amos and Andy," "Our Gang," some of the Mantan Moreland stuff. All of it noble comedy. My voyage is capped off with this, probably the best all-black cast of artists ever assembled. Fats Waller and Cab Calloway, Lena Horne and Ada brown, Bill Robinson and the amazing Nicholas Brothers.

If you haven't seen those brothers dance, you really must. And it has one of the funniest comedy skits in all filmdom. Yes, that skit has men in blackface, black men.

As with all shows planted in a film, the wrapping story is thin stuff, easily tolerated.

Quite apart from some wonderful dancing, and good music, there's a staging in the "Stormy Weather" production that is important.

We are watching a movie of a stage show. In the movie, Bill has been waiting for Lena to return to him, which she does in the show. The show starts with her singing the title song in front of a stage window with rain effects outside. At some point she pauses and the camera goes through that window to a world somewhere between stage and movie reality. 

Lena is here too, in the rain on the curb with a few men and women in odd, fragmented costumes. Now she sings another chapter. As this chapter closes, we zoom in on her head and go into dream-like vision she has. This time the set is highly abstract, the dancing is a ballet and the music more formal. The film stock is quite different, with the contrast pushed. The effect is quite abstract and wouldn't be matched until "Red Shoes." This sequence, of course, also features Lena. 

We spend some time in this world, then zoom back to the fragmented street, then back through the window to the ordinary stage, encountering Lena at each stage. Then of course out into the club with Bill watching.

Then later the stage show continues in the ordinary way with just one mix, the onstage finale of the courtship with the lovers united in front of the stage house. (A similar stage house figures in the wrapping story.)

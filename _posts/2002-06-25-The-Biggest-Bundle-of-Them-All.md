Spoilers herein.

Someone already stole whatever might have been worth something in this film. The best comment is in the film itself, when the tired lifeless gangster directs the operation by shouting 'one, two, three, four' and the hapless crew laconically walks through their paces. That's just what we have here with this brainless cast.

Hollywood should know by now that if they want a sexy girl, they have to get someone who has enough talent to create the effect.

The director is precisely like the capo: without control or effect. The film is precisely like the airplane: it lost whatever it could have brought to us.

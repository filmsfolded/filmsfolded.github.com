We all make extra allowances for honesty. Not innocence, which is a different thing existing before intent. But honesty. Its clear, clarity. And its what Clair specializes in.

Its what this story is centered on, and what Martin reaches for in every project.

He's an intuitive artist, not someone who feels a need to explain himself to himself. I think he genuinely wants to do meaningful things and for him that means honest things. 

So he starts with honesty, something of a brilliant honesty beyond being, which makes it beyond truth. You can see that in the characters: one lover is a symbologist, another someone who puts signs on speakers.

Whats interesting to me in this is what works and what doesn't. What does for me is Martin's food chain: honesty, tone, situation, characters, story. Its not the usual way of doing things, and indeed you can see that is not the way his selected filmmaker does.

This guy, Tucker, does it the conventional way: scene, characters, situation, tone. You can see it in every decision he makes. Martin must have gone home sick every day, having lost his honest film just as his character has lost his honest bedpartner.

There's something about placing a sense of an ideal world before your sense of who you are and drawing yourself from that world as this girl does, literally in her drawings (which are eventually celebrated). I suppose that is what spiritual tools do for some. But it is so much more endearing when you find it naturally in the world in an accessible being.

(Try to tune out the score which is blatant, dishonest in the way it tries to lead us. If it were a character, it would be the scheming golddigger.)

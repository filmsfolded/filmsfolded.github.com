Spoilers herein.

I saw 'Magnolia' first. Then a year or so after, had a chance to see this. Once again we have a film about film. I've written about this in dozens of comments. So far as that issue, there's nothing new here.

What we have here is a major talent who is still a juvenile. He understands how to write a scene that has meat for actors. He understands how to choose great actors, and some of the greatest actors around are here. He knows how to trust the spirit of the actor, and how to let them collaborate -- so often those with fire can shine. For instance Burt Reynolds fills his cup, but he does all the pouring.

The good news:

--the actors are on fire

--some scenes are exceptionally well written

--he's not afraid to use the camera in advanced ways

But each of these has qualifications, which are less obvious in the later film than here. But here the deficiencies really detract, and make this rather a disappointment given the sheer talent involved.

He trusts actors. He apparently understands acting. But some actors, even the national treasure Ms. Moore need commands, need a larger vision. She's good here, but see what she really can do in 'Vanya,' when she's pushed. Hoffman is lost here, reduced to superficial emotions. See what Mamet can do with him in 'State and Main' where multidimensional resonances are evoked.

He can write a good scene. And some of these ARE good. But he grows the film from the actors. They have interactions and those modulate into scenes. The bigger the view, the less control he has. A real writer, one who can write great films, also starts from the big picture. The big picture here is merely accidental. He needs meditation to balance his attention disorder.

He does some interesting camerawork. But every clever shot is a copy of work elsewhere. And they lack dramatic power. For instance, the long tracking shot in the beginning, does really touch a lot of bases, but each touch is light. Compare that to the opener of 'The Player,' where the shot is more than merely impressive, it means something, the scenelets have dramatic import. He has the motions down, but not the eye for power yet.

I went through the director's commentary on the DVD. How depressingly inarticulate this kid is. He's clearly talented -- he's got some moxie -- but he needs an intelligent mentor and the patience to listen.

There was a period when studios needed to play the game, the American game. They did it less because it sold tickets, instead the motivation was to protect their monopoly. Once they knew the topics, they simply figured out how to sell them in such a way that put butts in seats.

During the war the topics were simple enough. Afterwards, they had to celebrate similar home-oriented values. 

So here we have this little movie made by Grant and his then wife. The story here is a simple flow: two orphans with serious problems get folded into a perfect family. The crippled boy overcomes adversity, becomes an eagle scout and rides a bicycle. The girl, well she proves herself at a dance and as a babysitter. 

Its actually pretty depressing, the whole thing, What is it about us that we need to be reassured in such reduced terms?

Spoilers herein.

There's a standard film school course in self-referential and reflexive writing that's been cooking for about a decade now and we are now suffering the results. Bad screenwriters (the vast majority) mine this playbook. Here the whole kitchen sink is thrown in: we have the writing of movies ('The Player'), their display ('Cinema Paradiso'), the invented memory of individual and community, the 'telling' of some film people on others, even the defining text of the whole mess in a letter read by its dead author.

Its all tossed together here in a fine mess, where no element has any magic.

Along for the ride is the intrepid Jim Carrey. I don't think he's got the talent for this sort of thing, but he's smart enough to know what it is and seek out these projects. That's why he did the reflexive 'Truman Show,' and the even more highly folded 'Man in the Moon.' (Kaufmann wasn't funny, but it was funny that he wasn't.)

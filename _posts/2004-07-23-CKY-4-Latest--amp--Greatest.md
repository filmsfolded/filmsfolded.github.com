Spoilers herein.

I'm coming to this party late, without having seen the first three in the series. Heck, I don't  even know what the title means. 

But I have to say I like this. Yes it is juvenile, homophobic, scatological and often boring.  What I like is how it is placed. Usually we have the performances of movies, and separately -  nominally in a different world - we have the performance we give to our peers. I'm  convinced we base the second largely on the first without knowing we all live in our own  movie.

Now along comes a passel of kids who spend all their energy performing for each other. This  alone is no different than hundreds of thousands of similar passels of robots. What's cool  about this one is how they _know_ that their lives are performances and shamelessly present  it as a movie.

This is a wholly different thing than 'Dogtown' which is more of a movie about a slice of life.  This is a slice of life based on movies and elevated to a movie.

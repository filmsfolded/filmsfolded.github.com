There are some things here that will really ruin the pleasure of this. One is the goofiness of a 38 year old anorexic playing an open, unconstrained eighteen year old. Another is the profoundly dated styles that only look goofy today. And third is the most distracting. Its a sort of simplification of emotional depth, about the ups and downs of a relationship that seems so false, both dramatically trite and plainly unreal. Albert Finney's character is so phenomenally unlikable that you hope the relationship dissolves, but it doesn't: what was intended in its time to be a reconciliation is now simply a portrait of a trapped woman.

Also questionable is his character. The trick used here is that he is an architect. That's a story shorthand to tell you all sorts of things about what he is. It "explains" him. In good films when this is used, there's a cinematic expression of this, usually in how the character creates space that relates to the cinematic world we are in. Here, he carries a 3D camera that sees space but not people, but that's as far as we go.

What makes this something you may want to watch is how it is constructed. There are three devices used.

One is that everything takes place in cars travelling through France, either literally in them or at stops where the urge is always to get back in the car. Its a clever piece of writing in how it is handled here; usually the device is the trivial: life is a journey, you see. I encountered that sop in the popular "Miss Sunshine." Here it has to do with placelessness. Moderately interesting.

Filmmakers hate working with cars and dinner tables. There just aren't many ways to add interest. Its the other two devices that solve this.

The first is simple: this is a very fast paced film. Oh, the action moves very slowly. Plot lines develop more slowly than normal for the period. But the sceneshifting, the editing, was blindingly fast for contemporary moviegoers. Hard to imagine today, but this gave some folks vertigo and completely disoriented others.

The second is the way time is shifted. There are four periods overlain here, all in different cars of course. Not only are they unrolled out of chronological order, they literally pass each other. They pass the same places of course, but they really do pass each other as if time were this great generic strip of time (ten years long) that you tread over and over again. The story lacks blood, as I've said, but these devices would have given it great, great power if a few other choices had been made.

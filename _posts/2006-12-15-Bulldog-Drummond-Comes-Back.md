Another amazing experiment in the detective form, as filmmakers tried to do their own detective work on what works.

In this experiment, the detective is something of a nitwit, but with a charming fianc√©e. She is kidnapped of course and our detective has to "find" her by following all sorts of clues. Some of these need detecting and are pretty ludicrous. Others are simple; "go back to where you were." 

The experiment in the form involves the surrounding characters: two buffoons, and a wily inspector from Scotland yard. He's the detective behind the detective, usually in disguise. Its a double fold that doesn't quite work. So the experiment fails. But if you wander into this, the Scotland Yard man is John Barrymore playing his stage persona.

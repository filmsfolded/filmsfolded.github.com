As far as I am concerned this is a remake of "Morocco." 

That movie was a vehicle for Marlene Dietrich, someone with personal appeal -- a celebrity -- but scant talent as an actress. The challenge there was a matter of branding. She had been successful in some German films, where story and acting didn't matter -- it was all about mood. The idea was to bring her to Hollywood as a redhead with her (to me fairly uninteresting) German director and recreate that mood for the payoff US audience.

It has since become a formula: a woman in a "night club" in a far off or exotic place, faced with the attentions of two men: one "genuine" (and probably tough) and the other rich. I found "Morocco" to be a bad film and got some hate mail. But it was effective marketing, because the key to whole formula was the night club act which we must see early in the story.

That's where we establish the notion, the immense sexual charm, the ability to drive men crazy. Its a simple example of what I call folding: we as an audience are represented on- screen by an audience who watches. They are charmed out of their dull lives by this special woman, and so are we, in theory. Dietrich's Moroccon act was engaging because it seemed sexually deviant for the time. Bisexual, aggressive, hungry. It built a career for a weak actress.

So you can imagine the thinking with Hayworth. Here we had the number one pinup during the war, someone who in image as an engineered redhead in a significant way drove the war, the yearning part. And perhaps she ruined countless marriages as fantasies met reality as men returned. Now her career was in ruins in only a short time. Personal foibles, weak talent, changing times, bad choices.

So they copied "Morocco," added a pseudonoir thriller story (some nonsense about spies) and put huge attention into the signature nightclub number at the beginning, repeated in a way later in the story. To emphasize her soft appeal, a witchy young broad is there to heckle.

Unfortunately, it is in black and white. The famous artificial hairline can be seen though.

If you come to this, I will leave it to you to decide whether she succeeded. The public said no, and I think I do as well. 

You have a few choices with these. You can be exciting dance-wise, like say Ginger, Moira, Cyd or Carol Haney. Or even Judy.

Or you can be sexy, unique. They chose the latter, and I think that was their mistake. They chose the Dietrich route.

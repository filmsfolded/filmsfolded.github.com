Spoilers herein.

Journalism is sick. Its process filters interesting situations into simple battles, usually between good and bad persons. It must be reduced to persons. It must be a simple battle. Ideally someone wins, end of story.

Film itself is not so sick. It continues to provide an opportunity for art, for exploration of complex, subtle spaces.

Here we have a journalistic film. Its subject is one of the most interesting, engaging works of cinematic art. That art and the motion that surrounds it are rich. Which force wins? The force of reductionist cheap journalism, or the imperative to do something rich and nuanced? Right, what we get is the WWF of film criticism. We get a piece of Hearst-like journalism -- a simple battle over whether Hearst's concubine was impugned. The imperative to coordinate by command and what that involves is reduced to a battle of wills.

The very existence of reductionist tripe like this 'film' means that Hearst has won, pure and simple.

Welles' Hollywood career had as much to do with the nature of commercial art as anything else. He wanted to create; the system wanted to make money. Investors wanted something (like this dumbed-down documentary) that people will like. Welles wanted to challenge more than engage, to tweak more than mollify, to invent rather than reflect.

Many people now appreciate 'Kane.' Was that because he anticipated or invented the future? 

Many people now recognize 'Kane' as 'good.' Is that because of how he mastered the relationship between eye and space, or because (as many think) it is dramatically apt? Note this fact: the far better, and more radical 'Othello' is not so appreciated.

We all lose when our supposedly most intelligent institution for visual production (the PBS) produces something like this. We all lose.

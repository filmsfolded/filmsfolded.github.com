Spoilers herein.

Aging karate celebrity fights the devil and wins. Everything in this film is borrowed, mostly from TeeVee.

Princess, the girl is what the evil entity wants. Ho hum.

Ultratrashy films like this are better if you come at it from a different angle: Think about this from the black guy's perspective. This is someone for whom life is already cursed, someone for whom the devil might as well be a drug dealer. He's only capable of following but he has chosen to be second dog to a dopey cop. Jesus makes an appearance in this film(!) but it is as if he were just a higher up in the police force. 

The more you get into this, the more edgy it sounds. Sorta puts some taste in an otherwise cardboard film.

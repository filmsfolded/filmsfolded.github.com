Spoilers herein.

'Trainspotting' meets 'The Big Kahuna' meets 'The Ice Storm.'

Sean Penn is the best actor in film, period. He is one of the few actors who can act several roles simultaneously. Kevin Spacey is the best ensemble leader in film today. Though here he does his old wise man character, he knows how to project his being into the actors around.

You'll want to see this just to watch the craft. But the pacing is tedious. Some of the language is brilliant, And the basic notion, of obsessive self-referential examination is rich, but the enterprise fails because of the misunderstanding of time.

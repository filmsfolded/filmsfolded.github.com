Spoilers herein.

A doubly folded movie, but that's the only mildly interesting thing about this other than  Nichole's name on the marquee.

The first fold was the intended one. We all live in our own movies. This movie metaphorically  portrays one of those. Could have been a really interesting fabric, except for the unintended  second fold: this is about the almost inevitable draw toward the robotic. And it IS robotic.  You'd have to be Miss Piggy to miss that.

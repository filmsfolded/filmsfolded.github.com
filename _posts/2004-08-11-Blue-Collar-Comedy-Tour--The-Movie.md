Spoilers herein.

It used to be that a standup comic would make an LP. Cosby, Prior... all the greats would  have to generate funny from a universal place. We'd buy these for a specific laughing  purpose which is all but forgotten now. Things have changed - DVDs have switched the  economics of comedy, so that lesser talents can be moved into niches. Movies are all about  inventing lives, so those niches are now defined by comics and routines that are all about  helping the audience decide who they are.

I thought little of this was funny, and none of the unpracticed stuff. If these guys really were  blue collar comics, they would be genuinely funny people (we all know some) instead of  professional storytellers with funny material.

But I'll give them this: nearly all this humor is goodnatured. It invites the audience to poke  fun at itself. Contrast this with most 'black' humor, which helps its audience define itself by  poking fun at others.

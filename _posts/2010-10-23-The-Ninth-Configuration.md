Sometimes the process is transparent. You can see in the work what the writer is going through in the process of creating the work. He or she is not explicitly in the thing, but the struggle of creation is.

No one is going to think that Blatty is an important or even effective writer. That hardly matters when a writer is prepared to put his life on the line for us.

What happened here is that his spooky book was made into a successful movie, giving him some clout. Pepsi Cola wanted a bottling plant in Budapest, and was faced with a corrupt communism that wanted to attract movie makers to their otherwise unsuccessful city. So Pepsi agreed to finance any bad film and Blatty happened to fall into the opportunity.

(There is a bizarre product placement.)

This meant that he could indulge himself, and he does. The overall wrapper is a juvenile, banal notion of the search for God. A dedicated film enthusiast will know how to ignore these sections, mostly at the end. The main content is a Marx-brothers inspired bunch of set pieces of crazy Vietnam soldiers in a castle asylum. They have an unrealistic access to any props needed to support the skits. 

If you are able to look at this episodically, some of these skits are inspired, more like Ernie Kovacks than Groucho though. 

Most of these are based on writer's artifacts. One sequence follows a soldier determined to reimagine the works of Shakespeare as acted by dogs. Peppered throughout are references to other movies, as if the fantasies of the characters were guided by films. This includes an overlong extraction from "The Wild One."

A key character is a reluctant astronaut who realizes that he is part of a national drama of identity and cosmos.

The setup is that our narrator is the new psychiatrist who himself is crazy. His eyes are not to be trusted and the wackiness we see could easily be imagined. Because of this, and the hospital's complicity in letting him believe he is a doctor, this story is compared to "Shutter Island." But the later film is a whole, long form piece, with layered acting based on DiCaprio's lessons for "Inception." It carefully engineers a solution at the end for those who wish one and an ambiguous resolution for more serious viewers. It is whole and coherent.

This is merely a set of skits with the untrusted narrator's device. I see it as "Duck Soup" for Vietnam, at least in the central sections, combined with the dark night of the soul that a writer faces.

Spoilers herein.

Some films are trivial, but we SEE them in the context of real life, meaning OUR lives, so they gather meaning.

The original play is as trivial as they get: the sort of engineered platitudes that characterize, say 'Madison County.' That script is more or less preserved here, in equally vacuous form. All the crew: director and such are mere children along on the camping trip with the three principles. With their permission and ours, they hijack this film to take it places that have nothing to do with the script.

Everyone knows the story: somewhat damaged daughter Jane tries to reconcile with her dying, wooden Dad by creating a film world in which they can relate. She did, he gets his Oscar and dies.

But there's some more interesting elaboration here. These three actors all agree to one last serious project before ending their careers. But all three are from radically different acting traditions. Worse, each is a thoroughly uninteresting person in real life - rather incomplete - they all come alive on screen in different ways and become not only more complete, but attractively so.

Kate is an engineered person. A hardass driver who learned that the public doesn't like hardass woman. So she consulted with the best, commissioned a play tailored to invent a new persona, polished it on stage and made a comeback with 'Woman of the Year.' She doggedly stuck to that persona (and love) all her professional life. She is a selfish actress. She focuses on character at all costs, even when the story, situation and partnership with others suffers. We tolerate it because she has created an appealing personality, exemplified here in her solitary camp song dance. Hollywood loves this stuff.

Henry is almost the complete opposite. He is an intuitive who has little control over his own personality. His talent is in understanding how an actor can invest energy in a scene or situation. He is 'unselfish' in this regard. His moment of genius was as the guiding light behind '12 Angry Men' which is a case study in continuity among many actors and an understanding of acting with space. But poor Henry lost his fire early in the game. Possibly the lowest moment was 'Tenticles,' where he had no control over anything, self included. Hollywood hates THIS stuff.

Jane is wholly different: hungry for engagement and part of the 'method' school which requires an investment of self in the character. She requires sharing and intensity. Hollywood likes this sort of actor because they show up and work their buns off. In her world, nothing matters at all except the "connection" among actors.

Toss them together in a project where each knows it is their last, where each is desperate for success, and you get this: three rather unintegrated grandstands. Of these, I appreciated only Henry, and only in the scene of panic in the woods. That was the man we knew, working with space and unencumbered by the mechanics of the women.

All that is by way of commenting on what we see, which has little to do with the characters and everything to do with the actors. I call this 'folding,' when the reality of the production is somehow acknowledged IN the production.  I only wish that these energies would have been understood and accommodated by the script and/or director.

The DVD contains an 'extra,' one of those 'making of' documentaries. Usually they are listed individually by IMDB but not in this case. It consists of two stories: one of the frail, dying distant Dad, conflated in actor and character. The other is offensively banal: the story of the (Oscar-winning!) screenwriter who is a dumb as his script and guess what? so is the story about him.

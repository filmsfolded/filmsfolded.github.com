I saw this together with 'Charlie Chan in Black Magic' (aka 'Meeting at Midnight'). In that 1944 film was a black chauffeur, Birmingham Brown. He was a recurring character: nervous, bug-eyed, superstitious, cowardly. Would be considered racist today, but funny as all getout even now.

Eddie Murphy does Mantan for the first half of this movie, without much modification at all. I suppose it is all justified by the character's bravery and commitment in the second half.

I was hoping for something else, a true occurrence where the house itself is a character. There are some great examples of this, from the good films ('The Shining,' 'Fourth Floor') to the bad ('13 Ghosts,' and dozens of others). They didn't even try here.

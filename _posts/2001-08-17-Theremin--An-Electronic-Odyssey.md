Spoilers herein.

What lovely women! What strange political machinations, politics of country, music, science, history. What vile conspiracies.

What a story about how a new sound gets transformed from its intent as a source of beauty to the very icon of spookiness. Sound is like food, perceived as we learn.

The pathos of a branch of evolution choked.

How cool that Moog has the pocket full of pens. The early Theremin the white lab coat, and the old one the tape on the glasses. 

And this has Brian Wilson too! Anything with him is worth spending time with.

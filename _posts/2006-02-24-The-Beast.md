Its the oddest thing, how some interesting ideas find themselves in such awkward places, as if master sushi chefs were hidden in the kitchens of MacDonald's. You'll find that a lot in soft core porn, I think. Franco, Brass, Sarno weren't dummies in the way they imagined things.

Erotic films on their face are a massive opportunity for clever ideas, in part because of the safety they provide -- audiences pay attention to the one thing allowing you to exercise your inner filmmaker in the other.

But there's a coupling as well, between the erotic image and cinematic skill. It takes a deep understanding of both the medium and the senses to make something even partly erotic, as the avalanche of uncinematic and unappealing video porn proves.

Check out this story structure. We see one story, a rather ordinary setup of a pretty girl betrothed to a relative unknown guy. She is exposed to material that prompts her to imagine another story, which we see as a movie within. The fantasy within that is as fantastic compared to her situation as hers is to our "real" lives.

Commentors note two images, that of the rose-masturbation that accompanies the creating of the inner movie. Its quite explicit and rather lovely as these things go. And then there's the inner fantasy of the historical girl being chased and ravished by the beast, with an extraordinary focus on his phallus, just as our fantasizing woman would. (One of the materials she (and we) are exposed to is the opening of the film which features a horse erection.) He ejaculates to death and our ancient beauty covers him with leaves and runs home, presumably impregnated, producing the groom of the modern story.

But believe me, except for a very few elements, the recounting of it has more value than its cinematic expression. It just is bad film-making.

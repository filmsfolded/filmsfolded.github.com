Spoilers herein.

I'm constantly amazed at how quickly some fresh, edgy cinematic ideas go stale. This was  strange enough it its time to be noticed: the placement of the narrative stance within the  sixth grade.

Having played its small role in advancing the scope of narrative irony, it is now merely  stupid. I guess the torch has been temporarily passed to Austin Powers.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Spoilers herein.

You know why I like this movie? I spent easily over a thousand dollars on all the bad movies this makes fun of. Now I get double my bad movie value.

The first 'Scary' was great. It made fun of the audience. You couldn't get what was being made fun of unless you were just the kind of dope who both went to the original movie being made fun of AND you thought the spoof joke was funny. This was pretty clever stuff, right on the edge of spitting in your eye and expecting you to laugh. But we did.

The sequel bears the same relation to the original that the Blair Witch sequel did. The original BWP was an intelligent reference to the state of film. The sequel referenced not the same state that the original did, instead it referenced the phenomenon of the first film.

And so it is here. This sequel doesn't make fun of the audience directly as before, but indirectly by reference to the first. Not every kid will be able to follow this. But I'm impressed by those that can.

Your tipoff is James Woods, and the reference to 'Shadow of the Vampire.'

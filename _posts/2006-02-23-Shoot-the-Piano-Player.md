Goodness me. I tend to "load" movies beyond what the casual viewer would. And I am the perfect candidate for films that have lots of blank placards here and there, areas of vacuum where you are supposed to place your cinematic references and thus remind yourself of the vacuity of your own life.

But after a couple movies, that gets uninteresting. Godard evolved and took chances. Resnais targeted the structure of the vacuum and not the vacuum itself. Truffault, well, you have to make your own choices in life.

To an amazing extent, you are what you digest artistically. Your soul sees with the spectacles you allow.

So you'll have to make a choice about this movie. The character reaches out twice, to two women. Each time, they die because they care for him. Once, he himself kills for one. So he retreats. It is all about the retreat and why.

He is a consummate artist and his retreat is into pop music. There's a terrific long song about falsies that he accompanies, sort of a minishow within the show. So it is clever, this notion of showing a character and his relationship to 3 women that reflects Truffault's choices about a relationship to us. And there is a lovingly edited sequence where he and the third woman are languidly lolling in postcoital linens.

But if you choose to accept this movie on its own terms, you'll be acting just like the piano player. Is that what you want?

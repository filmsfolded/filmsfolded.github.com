Even though this has been widely reviled, I sought it out because it features three people whose careers I track. These aren't on the A list, but I have a rather short B list.

Rodriguez is the most interesting film editor working today. He is an absolute master of the software (Apple's Final Cut) and writes, directs and often even shoots and scores around the craft of editing. Even his earliest and dumbest stuff is crisp in this respect. Here, he does nothing but direct and edit and the result is disappointing. Since he had no control over the blocking and scene definition, all he can do is show up.

Clea is one of the most interesting young actresses around. She blew me away in the extremely ambitious "Thirteen Conversations" and later in two similarly folded projects, "21 Grams" and "Identity." She showed that she understood what they were about. Rare in an actress. Here, a much younger woman misses a chance to play someone who has an inner self. Her blond hair is darkened to emphasize the purity of another girl who turns out to be evil.

Kevin is an interesting writer of folded stuff. His folding is explicit and unsophisticated: he has characters talk about their circumstances as if they were in a movie. But it is fun nonetheless. In this case, he shows that everyone knows there are only a few stories in life: all you have to do is know which one you are in to know what to do next.

He's cleverly set this in a "Breakfast Club" setting. That genre relies on the well-perceived truth that in high school, there really are only a few (probably seven) stories or character roles. You pick one, and that tells you who you are and what to do next. Life as movie, I love it. But not enough to recommend this fumbled project.

Spoilers herein.

I am surprised at those who take this at face value. This director would never make such a film.

The twist is that the killer never existed; the whole thing came from her own madness fueled by her illustrations of 'fairy tales,' and triggered by her husband's infidelity. That's why the apples, the snow white, the fairies, the superdog, the flood, the inexplicable telekinesis, the impossible Alice-like falls, the Mother Goose rhymes... It is why everything is told in images.

The question is why is this film reviled, and 'Mulholland Drive' celebrated?

The architectural decisions were different. Lynch decided to fool us only so long, then to give us 'real' reality. He decided to pepper the first part with clear fantasy and the second with clear madness. It was not as much handholding as the similar 'Vanilla Sky,' but a lot.

Jordan decided to not help out the stupid. He drops a few hints here and there, like 'Vivian's' haircut at the end. Like using a sexually ambiguous child as young Vivian.

It is a lot like the payoff in 'Bladerunner,' where hardly no one gets that Ford is a replicant himself. So most people never got it here and thought of this as a sort of 'From the Deep.' I personally think much of the blame can be laid at the feet of Ms Bening. She's not a bad actress, but one not sufficiently intelligent to act two characters at once. Winslett, Blancett, Moore could have.

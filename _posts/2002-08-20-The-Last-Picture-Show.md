Spoilers herein.

In the world of film, or I suppose any art, there are four levels of competence.

--You've got the incompetent. They're clear enough to recognize

--You've got the folks that have mastered the ordinary vocabulary, established by others. These folks can produce amusing and moving films but unless you have a particularly empty life usually aren't worth the time.

--Add to that the ability to coherently project your own personal vision, only your vision isn't interesting

--And finally you have the masters who have something interesting to say, know how to say it and innovate when they need to, or whenever they please

That fourth category are the ones worth watching. Only among them, can you start to sort out which of them are worth using to invent yourselves. To even reach the third level is rare, and if by a youngster, usually generates a hullaballo.

I think for the very brief period of this film, Bogdonovich raised himself to the third level. He clearly taps the actors' natural tendencies to project and in a few cases to interact. But that is all we have: emotionally committed performances to no end. There's no underlying intelligence here, even in (actually, especially in) the source book.

Many of the filmmakers he says he admires eschew 'meaning' but that notion is not only deliberate, but reflected in what they do instead. There's no 'instead' here -- and I have to report that this simply is not worth your time unless you study actors.

I had the remarkable good luck to see this and 'Elephant Man' in the same day. They are both exuberant, actor-centric, back and white films that evoke a sense of place and specific mores. They are both by young talents that were for the the first time being 'sponsored' and working to find how to work within the system. 'Elephant' employed professional actors who, while relatively unknown were highly, highly accomplished. 'Picture' uses amateurs and newcomers for the boys and relatively ordinary actresses for the women.

I walked away from 'Elephant' with images, some of which are worth keeping (as if I had any choice). 'Picture' leaves me with recall of a few tightly crafted situations, but this will fade -- flowers versus trees.

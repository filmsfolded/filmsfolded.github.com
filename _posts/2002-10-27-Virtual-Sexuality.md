Spoilers herein.

I suppose we will see even more of these kinds of films, ones that use the 'computer' to play with the notion of a film that invents itself. Or in this case: a character in the film who is created by another character (who is herself created). 

This one is less interesting than most: all of the creative seasoning goes to please their target audience: teenyboppers. Even in this thin gruel, the notion of 'abstraction distance' is preserved. That's the rule that the 'film within the film' is precisely as far from the film as that film is from reality and in the same direction. So where we have teen characters abstracted from the real world to suit our dreams, so too do they have fabricated characters further abstracted.

This technique has become so common as to find its way into such mechanical drivel, so is blessed as law.

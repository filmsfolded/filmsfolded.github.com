Let me warn you that in terms of nearly every element this is just too cheesy to bear.

I came to this knowing something of its history. It is based on magical principles as described in what was thought to be an authoritative book, and had to be produced on another island for fear of "offending" Balinese. This was underwritten by the corrupt government as an attempt to get foreign currency.

The reason I was excited was because I know a bit about Balinese religion. Its a sort of Haiti/New Orleans of the Pacific where old pantheism and ancestor worship mixes with the colonial religion. In this case, that wrapper a strange brew of old Hinduism with Buddhist rituals. And the whole is surrounded geographically by strident Islam which tends to make the minority religion stronger.

I know, for instance, that ritual and theatrical displays are at the heart of this magic. And I know that it is highly cinematic in its potential. Julie Taymor's work, even with her recent Beatles project is based on this inner ritual. There's a powerful old film, "Legong" that captures a bit of the genuine stuff, and is pretty darn haunting.

So imagine my surprise to encounter not something Balinese or even magical but Starwars in Indonesian garb. Yes, folks, Star Wars, most particularly the second film (now numbered what, 5?). You have the two young skywalkers, Yoda, the senior Jedi, the evil dark emperor (here a witch). Yes, you even have the levitation and light saber effects. The telekinetic objects lifted and thrown in battle. 

What's taken from the old magical tradition are the notion of a disembodied head with attached ka who stalks villagers as a vampire. And the special power of vaginal blood, especially when accompanied and caused by a miscarried or aborted fetus. Its powerful stuff but made comic here by the Ed Woodish nature of the thing.

Its a miss folks. Maybe next time.

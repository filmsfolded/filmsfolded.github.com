Comedic acting comes in two flavors -- intuitive and selfaware. Most actors are intuitives who stumble upon some device that works, then they exploit it -- or find projects that match it. The other kind is rare: someone who thinks about comedy, has enough insight to understand the effect desired and has enough self-control to create that effect. Dunst is young yet, but she shows signs of being the second type.

Much of her work is merely competent portrayals of dizzy but charming teens. This is particularly easy to play because all teens are acting some role, usually insecurely. But 'Dick' made me sit up and notice where she was coming from. Its a rather difficult and unstable perch to maintain when simultaneously being something genuine, not a genuine character but an icon of a cultural domain, and poking fun at it on our behalf. Not just making us laugh at the character (as, say the Farrellys), but of something in ourselves as a culture. More like a sophisticated standup by charades. Julia Stiles is also tentatively in this same category in my mind.

After 'Virgin Suicides,' I'm going to be watching what she does with her career. Will she do a Winona? a Drew? a Roberts? or if we are lucky, something else.

So far as the film, it consists of episodic skits that make fun of enough that most people will find something funny. The dancing crucifix and obsequious patriotism did it for me. This collage approach covers a lot of film-making inadequacies, and the whole affair would have collapsed if Kirsten wasn't doing her thing, presumably behind the director's back.

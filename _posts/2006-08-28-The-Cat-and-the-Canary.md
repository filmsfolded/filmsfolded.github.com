When you watch these old things, you must guess about what they were when they were new.

Are what we now see as clichés not clichés but have become so since? Would the genre have been solid by then and ready for self-referential comedy? 

For instance Bob Hope arrives and starts to mention how movies like this always go. He says that at this point such and such usually happens, and then that thing does happen. Was that a new thing then?

I suppose that what we see as cliché's were already solid clichés. And that the genre was well established but that genres meant something quite different then. There were fewer and the format in each genre was more narrowly defined. So cliché wasn't quite the negative thing it is today, rather consisting of familiar touchstones. 

Genres were a new thing, really only taking on something like their modern meaning in the thirties. So by the end of the thirties they were solid enough to start getting the humorous self-reference like this, and what would later be the Abbot and Costello formula, recently evolved into "Scream" and its children.

Here's an example in this movie. It is a remote mansion where ghosts are suspected and spooky happenings occur. Secret passages. Murders. A lost necklace. Early in the game a uniformed policeman shows up and says that he is chasing an escapee from the nearby insane asylum. All during the action, he hovers outside.

Caution here: there are spoilers that follow for the 1934 "The Ghost Walks."

This plot device is from that quite popular earlier movie. Viewers would recognize it, because it is so oddly shoehorned in. In the 34 movie, there's a clever twist in that the uniformed guy turns out to be the killer; he's the escaped inmate in disguise. 

So to have this inserted here (it wasn't in the earlier versions) can only be because the writers wanted to play with the trick. 

I study these things where the movie includes external comment on itself. I believe this was formed in the thirties and that this was an important milestone. And "The Ghost Walks" was too, which is why it is referenced here.

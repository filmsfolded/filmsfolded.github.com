Spoilers herein.

I love films where the context of the film perfectly matches its content. Here we have an aging star vainly trying to hold on. Olivier was much celebrated in his youth for his energetic reading of Shakespeare. That's a plus in Britain where accident has forged the notion that his plays are all about providing empty vessels for actors with power and nerve. Quite apart from the dangers of so limiting Shakespeare, this limits a career too. If one is rooted in the theatrical, and one is celebrated for overjuicing roles in such a way that they thrill, then like any other athlete, you are doomed to fade. And this, just as your peers are blossoming as cinematic icons!

That's what this story is about as well.

That energy is essentially sexual. How does an older man regain sexual energy? By taking a young lover of course. That is both what our character and actor does, placing their beauties in their productions. Joan Plowright is the center of the project, and rightly so. Around her, his grandness publicly explores what it means to be out of gas with the world on your case.

Intellectually, this is a profoundly interesting project. But the bottom line is, well he IS out of gas.

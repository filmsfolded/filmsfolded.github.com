Visual media, especially TeeVee and adding radio exist in an economy of ideas that restrict them. The restrictions are severe because the human mind has a hardwired need for narrative, a story, a collection of reasons and events that make sense. The more clear the sense of the thing, the stronger it pulls on us.

So each of us enter into that space needing something that simply seems clear. Some of that is in the simplicity of the thing, some in the simple art of storytelling and some having to do with how well it fits our "real" world. 

Conservative political philosophy didn't have to become the sole owner of these simplicities. At root, conservative views (way back) were as complex, subtle and yes, honorable as any other. But by an accident of history, for some short term gain they appropriated the simple tools of the closed limited story of film and such. This created the appearance of an "opposition" as what is now called "liberal" ran toward loud claims that the world is not as simple as the others presented.

It is an accident of history that the conservatives own the cinematic platitudes. From this comes the obvious observation that it is impossible to have liberal talk radio, for instance.

This is the situation Micheal Moore walks into. He sees a world that has adopted simple views that are divorced from reality. He senses that the best attack is to try to win back the platforms. He's been in the magazine, talk radio and TeeVee business, but it is movies where he found the right formula -- and that is to present as simple a story from the opposition as that now pushed by the red state/business consortium.

Thus, we have a simple story in "9-11" that Bush took us to Iraq because of family connections to the oil business. Sounds incredibly stupid when written, but a powerful cinematic presentation -- skilled -- sorta had it make sense when you watched.

Before that was this. The goal is to come up with a narrative as simple and powerful as that of the NRA crowd, and map it to a cinematic vocabulary. I'll let you decide whether this is a worthy enterprise, based on the costs and benefits.

But the question here is not about whether the "argument" is right, the narrative true, but whether it is good film-making. I think not. That's because he tries two things here: he presents his own quest for "the answer" at the same time he presents us with the answer.

So we ramble through all sorts of tentative narratives, discarding each along the way: Indians, slavery, imperialism. Then on to the nature of media: video games, edgy rock, the selling of fear via TeeVee. He should have stuck with that because it would have matched the folding of his quest with the goal.

So on to the institutionalization of fear in the American character. Surprisingly little on the gun lobby and the link of American entrepreneurialism in the face of no social net to the "spirit of individualism" and the link to self defense. Too complex, those, I guess.

If you think of yourself as "liberal," you may want to think twice about what it implies to stoop to simple narratives. If you are interested in effective film-making, look instead at Moore's 9-11 movie. Its more effective at the game.

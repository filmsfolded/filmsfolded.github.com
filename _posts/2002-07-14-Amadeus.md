Spoilers herein.

Sometimes things just come together for no apparent reason. And when they do, they are either of the Mozart type or Salieri types. Here's how to tell in films: no chances are taken -- no experiments are made -- everything is extremely competent, but in following rules established by others.

That's this film, and it is ironic that it is its own damnation. It is unelaborate, too few notes. Each character can be fully described in one sentence. Every situation as well.

Mozart's genius was in creating depth in the music -- music which commented on itself by elaborating itself. The phrases were novel, but tricky -- after hearing them you believed you knew them all along but were wiser because of it. Not so this film, which is lush but unrewarding.

So why is it well-received? Because it has costumes, is easy to read, has pleasant music. And -- I believe -- because it has the required self-referential 'play with the play.'

Spoilers herein.

Must be the drugs. I have no doubt that Richard Rush had a hard time getting his film  through all the hoops. It is neither fish nor fowl: not sufficiently intelligent to be an art  success, too clumsy to engage conventionally. And I have no doubt that his most clever  decision was to target mainstream movie reviewers rather than serious critics.

It allowed them to ever-so-slightly stretch their minds while noting the film's  exuberance.

Now, much later, a real intelligent filmmaker in such a product as this, would add  another integrated layer. And the raw material is there: Rush's bitterness at not getting a  decades-long parade. He could have done what, say, Fellini did in his superb 'Notebook,'  honestly exploring that confusing space between creativity and delivery.

Instead, he treats us like bartenders, rendering a torrent of complaints. And it is not even  that interesting a story. This diminishes the original film. It convinces that no one  involved was as intelligent as the ideas they were working with.

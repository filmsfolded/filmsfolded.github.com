I still remember the night I saw this on TeeVee. It was fifty years ago, and by getting perfect grades, I had earned the right to watch an hour of "adult" shows. I selected this and entered the world of clever narrative structure.

It was only a few weeks after JFK had announced we would go to the moon and months before Texas murdered him. It was even before the famous "vast wasteland" speech and in fact there was still the expectation that TeeVee could be a revolutionary force for good in the world -- like we had for the internet for a couple years in the 90s.

A major channel for advertising in those days were the covers of matchbooks that would be freely provided with the omnipresent cigarettes. One of the advertisements I had seen was the Rod Serling writing school. For a few dollars, you would get some story guidelines and a "professional editor" to read and comment on your stories. So I was primed to believe that Mr Serling was the smartest writer alive.

If you have not seen this, it has a panicked, wordless Agnes Moorehead fighting off some miniature invaders. It is actually not well staged or choreographed, but her terror was visceral. I remember the sweat and spittle. At the very end, after she has killed one monster, mortally wounded the other and destroyed the spaceship with an axe... only then do we discover that the invaders are humans and she is a giant on some other planet. In fact, NASA was still a division of ARPA, not yet even with "space" in the name.

I was seriously affected. Later, when Twilight Zone went to an hour and got repetitive was it clear that one simple twist was good enough for a preteen 20 minutes of amusement, but my man Rod know nothing about long form engagement. But by then, this experience was burned into my prehormone mind, and it was something of a self-discovery to see again last week. The picture was far more clear than on my 12 inch Zenith, and this time I recognized the spaceship as from "Forbidden Planet." Thankfully, I would only see that later, when I could absorb it with some skill, but sadly without the red glasses gimmick.

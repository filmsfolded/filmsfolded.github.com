Spoilers herein.

There's something about this type of self-referential film. Some of my regular readers have objected to the use of that term. Nested self similarity would be better, I suppose as on of the types in a larger analysis of self-reference.

These are films , for instance whose moral is bluntly to avoid being superficial and formulaic, but which themselves are superficial and formulaic. Here we have a film that preaches the evils of using media to sucker kids, and whose primary visual feature is product and logo placement. But the thing is done in conspiracy with the teen/preteen audience; but rather than parody or even sharp satire, we get an attitude of; 'sure it's superficial but its fun.' That's troubling, and it completely undercuts our appreciation of the growing self-referential sophistication of the young audience.

On the other hand, we've seen a flood of movies based on comics recently. Most only dimly evoke the nature of the inspiration; although both comics and movies are primarily visual, comics engage the imagination far more. Comics are to movies what radio is to TeeVee. This film captures the tone of the comic better than any film I have seen short of one Japanese animation.

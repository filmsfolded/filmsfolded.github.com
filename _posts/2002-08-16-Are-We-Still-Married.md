Spoilers herein.

I have a more robust comment over on the 'Films of the Brothers' page. This is one of 11 films on the DVD. It and its sequel, 'Can't Go Wrong Without You,' are the very best of that collection. They are the most personal, based on reverse kabbalah and Alice in Wonderland, and I think the most accessible.

I have never been so visually stimulated as in these two 3-4 minute films.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth Watching

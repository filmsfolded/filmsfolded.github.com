Spoilers herein.

Shawn is in the tradition of playwrights who concern themselves with what it means to be a playwright and gives the audience reflection on what it means to be an audience. Often touched by Mamet and Stoppard, this notion has entered the mainstream popular film suitably watered down.

All three of those writers wrap their self-referential, layered works in unusual language. In Mamet's case, it is a studied cadence of vernacular; in Stoppard's a rhythm of tossing the narrative among characters. Shawn's use of language is at once more poetic -- there are lots of memorable one-liners here -- and at the same time constantly meandering among levels. At one point, the narrative concerns some 'real world' act like a shooting, but then it slips into observation of the act of observing, and then to wondering about what that metaobserving means. And what the benefits are, and whether we find value in it, and whether it destroys us, even makes us brutal.

Does the existence of Howard create the thugs of the world? Does 'lowbrow' exist only because someone has extracted 'highbrow.' Do regrets form a sort of appreciation? Can anyone love and be aware?

I personally love this stuff, especially when it goes through a Woody Allen filter as in 'Sweet Hereafter.' But this film/play is not of the caliber of 'Dinner with Andre' which truly sang, and 'Vanya on 42nd St' which with much practice and refinement mastered the shifting of metalevels more deftly.

There is, however, a delicious metatext in Nichols' performance. Here is an intelligent man himself: a master of dramatic humor, a precise director, a writer. Watch what he does, He is not acting the character -- he is acting as Wallace Shawn acting the character.

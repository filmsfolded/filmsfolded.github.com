I recently saw "Hangover," and wondered why we find intoxication so universally funny. Not expecting much of an answer from anywhere, I came to this. The gimmick here is that our hero gets drunk and then follows a sleepwalking girl (who Harold later marries!).

The whole movie is a setup for them wandering out on one of those ledges that seems to only exist in movies: incredibly high, just narrow enough to walk on and accessible from double hung windows. Now I have every reason to believe that they really did perform this dangerous stunt -- and it is only slightly less impressive that they were only pretending to be oblivious. Many people watching this would know that Harold blew half his hand off in a previous stunt that went wrong.

And yet, it depends on that drunk routine. It didn't seem funny, nor can I see how it ever would have, though I know it was considered hilarious. But then this was made during prohibition, roughly equal to the situation today with roofers.

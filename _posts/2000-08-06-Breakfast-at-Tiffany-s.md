Some of these old movies do not age well. But this one is perhaps more charming now than when it was made. Hepburn and Peppard, Mancini and Mercer, Edwards and Capote, Each (except Peppard) is master of their own quirky corners of the universe which are briefly brought into alignment here. The end is a little smaltzy, but that's unavoidable and it is brief.

Capote set these characters as biting caricatures rooted in the real, twisted world, and Blake wisely (in retrospect) made them more cartoonish (more "phony"), somewhat off kilter in a pretend world. The score is one of those rare scores that can support the non-bombastic vision of clever wryness. (Danny Elfman is possibly equally capable, but his patron is a little too weird.)

Hepburn makes this work, as the visible part of the team. I wonder if she had even a part of the charisma in real life she shows here. Monroe was to have done the part originally, and it is fun while watching to view a parallel imaginary film with Marilyn instead of Hepburn.

The racism of the Rooney character jars today. That's the only rough spot, but it does add well to the phoniness.

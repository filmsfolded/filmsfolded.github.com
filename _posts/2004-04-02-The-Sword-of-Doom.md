Spoilers herein.

For me, the competition among samurai movies is rough. For me to think one is great, it  must have lots of story efficiently told in a cinematic way. It must define a character and  society full of complex rules that are played out physically and honorably (despite the  real history). That honor must be a key part of the machinery of fate which drives all the  complexities of the story.

This one just misses. It does have some by then standard compositions, and some  memorable ones. It has lots of scheming. Lots of fighting that is supposed to be  explosive but is not. Lots of tradition while seems more mythical than rooted in  character. It even has Mifune, but in a still role.

What works for me is any Kurosawa/Mifune samurai, any Teshigahara, and "Realm of the  Senses"

The combination fight at the end is clearly hallunicatory. I wish there had been some  more adventuresome camerawork.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 3 -- has some interesting elements

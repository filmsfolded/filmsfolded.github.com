Spoilers herein.

There's a lovely Shinto tradition of folding prayers and leaving them on trees. The more  clever, careful and perfect the fold, the more whole the message will be.

I am in the midst of writing a book about 'folding' in film. Folding in this context refers to  layers of some kind that carry double meaning. The simplest and easiest to describe is the  kind of folding in this little movie.

A movie is a message sent to us and sugared enough in some way that we will receive it. One  of the most effective flavorings is the 'love story' which though invented by books is now  exclusively owned by cinema. The message we send to ourselves and our loved ones about  what love IS is a message that comes from films, each of which is a lower order of message.

Sparks understands this, so he devises stories about messages. With 'Message in a Bottle,'  he did it simply with one layer. Here, he employs three, which added to the two above makes  five folds in this slick film, five origami birds approaching our window.

Sparks' three messages are:

- the one from Noah to Allie every day

- the notebook of the title that Allie wrote, effectively to herself to use her love to bring  herself back to her love

- the letters that Noah wrote, one per day for a year.

Now whether you find the gauzy valentine haze too sweet, or the notion of the world (not  just the world of love) too smooth and safe, you have to admire how this film was conceived.  These sorts of things don't happen by accident, they are engineered by people who study the  deep cognitive mechanics of this business. Oddly, the plot suggests that happy  unengineered accidents are what are more real.

Okay, I've now seen three Kern projects, enough to say that the concept behind his conceptual vision isn't worth the effort. This is a worthy subject, clearly not original. The only thing he could have brought to his exploration was adventuresome women subjects. His "Sewing Circle" is about the most extreme, and it is nowhere extreme enough to cross the threshold he sets.

The violent nature of viewing, the exploitation of borrowed emotion -- particularly sexual -- needs some nuance to penetrate the multilayered shells we've built to prevent ourselves from acknowledging the problem. Mere sledgehammers won't do. Try "Peeping Tom" instead.

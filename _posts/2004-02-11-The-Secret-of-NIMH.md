Spoilers herein.

I love it when a film's nature reflects its content. This is a story about commonplace,  vulgar creatures modified beyond their scope to be intelligent. It is itself a collection of  vulgar, commonplace cliches artificially elevated by masterly animation. The use of color  is particularly intelligent; in fact I cannot recall anything remotely as

exciting.

But sitting through it is a real trial: we have part Beatrix Potter; part new age antiscience  diatribe; and part tired Disney character formula all plowing directly at our presumed  hotbuttons. I suspect that one or two colorists were among the Disney defectors and that  they subsequently left Bluth. Every project after this has been visually dreary, sufficiently  so that you notice the commonplace stories.

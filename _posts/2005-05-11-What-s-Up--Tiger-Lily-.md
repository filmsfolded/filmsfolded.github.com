This is juvenile. At least the jokes are.

But those of us who follow Woody closely don't particularly watch his films because they are intrinsically good. Rather, they provide us with a collection of essays on film-making that plumb some rather deep ideas. Or at least his real movies do.

But even in this lark, which isn't all his anyway, you can see his approach to film even before he became an important figure in the community. He believes in dual narratives: the story and the story about the story. Its a French New Wave idea. (Indeed, he plays King Lear in Godard's best movie.)

He believes in creating absurd humor between these two layers. Actually, he was mining this as a standup comedian and writer well before getting involved in film-making. He credits Alfred Jarrey and it shows.

How best to have one story laid on another? You just buy a story and make another on top. Simple. Make sure the audience has at least one sequence that is fully outside both layers. Here, it is a shift to the "projectionist's" hand that segues into a encounter of silhouettes. 

Of course, the idea of the thing is far funnier than any execution could be, but even that fact is to the point.

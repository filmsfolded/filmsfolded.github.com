Spoilers herein.

The revenge drama is probably the oldest we have. As with a few other genres, the form  has rigid rules: innocent lives destroyed by evil, reluctant crusader made invincible by  justice. The only choice is a matter of style. Here, as usual, the style is built around an  actor's personality. The purity of the genre and the simplicity of the story makes that  personality ever sharper, more important.

So commenting on these films means merely commenting on a personal style. Segal's  style is a sort of a zen urban Americanized edition of the Hong Kong film version of East  Asian martial arts. It is a particularly artificial, synthesized notion, engineered purely in  order to advance the genre. Segal takes the only option available to him: he plays it  straight.

I think he succeeds in advancing the genre, but these films are boring: just another brick.  Unless. Unless you have been following Kelly LeBrock from her 'Women in Red' days. I  think the ability to look good on the screen is a matter of acting. It is amazing to me how  few women do look terrific on film and are also bad actresses in other important  respects. Kelly achieves this. I think that's why she was picked, so as not to overshadow  the preening Segal.

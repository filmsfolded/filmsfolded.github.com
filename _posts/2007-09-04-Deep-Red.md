There's a mix in these things, a mix of incompetence, inelegance and trash together with gems of cinematic competence, even wonderful adventure. 

This is dePalma without the knowledge of long form composition, and lacking relevance.

Let's just leave the complaints to that. Its the things worth watching that we need to focus on.

The first is the sheer blast of composition. The movie itself has no shape, but certain scenes are pretty darn wonderful. Some are good simply because of the compositions that were designed. A few are so striking and original they demand respect. Its a thrill. Others go beyond that to matters of staging that have to do with deeper matters: like how music is used.

The killings aren't like killings would be in real life: they're fabricated as if the folks in the world we see are striving to be in a movie. Movements are made only so that we can see and read them. Each murder is a stage play. They are prefaced by a children's tune. Not one that appears in the filmscore, but one that is literally played by the murderer who brings a tape recorder! And guess what? Our detective -- whose motive is just that he is curious -- is a musician, who follows clues that are either in the music or in images he finds. Its really quite well done.

And there's the management of images within. The first victim is a psychic, who we incidentally learn is a student of Kabbalah (the real). Her apartment is festooned with all manner of psychic drawings and paintings one of which factors centrally. Its also very well done. Other drawings are discovered; indeed the whole plot is essentially a voyage from one image-clue to another. A penultimate scene takes us to one of the most remarkable buildings in film. Its a huge old city mansion: stone and pale stained glass. Designed in a manner of Art nouveau but with that uniquely Italian sense of rococo that even perverts the elegance of Guarini. I wish someone could tell me where it is, presumably Turin.

Finally, there's the matter of iconic actors. There are three of note. The director's wife is the recording detective, playing a reporter. She's redheaded of course. (The second victim is too.) Then there's Nicoletta Elmi who enjoyed a big career for a few years in these sorts of movies as the wonderfully attractive redheaded preteen who turns out to be evil. She's inserted here only because the director had her available and her presence would be a red herring. Then there's our detective, the musician. He's played by David Hemmings, the detective in "Blow up." At the time his presence meant something: a seeker, a new world eye. He was an icon in "Barbarella" too!

Oddly, the extended "Italian" version I saw had the most curious dubbing. Half of it was dubbed in English, half in Italian, alternating every minute or two. Quite unsettling if so designed.

Ted's Evaluation: -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

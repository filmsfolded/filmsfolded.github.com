I'll watch any film that the Mankiewicz brothers touch, but this was a hard slog for me. Its from that period of relief, gloating and redefining of the English people after the Germans were neutralized for the time. There was some unsure notion about the whether the future would bring yet another brutal war.

So here is this story, whose importance is that the Germans could easily have won the war were it not for multiple incompetencies and spatting factions within the command. They had a very valuable spy who they simply refused to believe. Clever Brits (there have to always be clever Brits) were on to him of course, but too late for the worst damage.

So the story would have had some resonance in its time, and the poor narrative qualities would have been ignored. More important was the fact that exterior scenes were shot "where things really happened."

Its hard to see the Mankiewicz style here. Its most visible in some shots on a rail car, and later in an Istanbul caf√©.

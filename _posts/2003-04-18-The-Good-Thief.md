Spoilers herein.

Some time back, Soderbergh took time from his glossy projects to remake 'The Limey.' It was a copy but so much more: it was a film about the previous film. This was emphasized and leveraged by shots that were overlain on shots, echoing and restating motion. Very clever, but too intellectual for most I guess. To hoots and catcalls, Van Sant remade 'Psycho' in a more reverential way, but the amazing Julianne Moore led a self-referential revolt of the actors to create an annotative subtext. So when you watch the film, you see three films at once: the excellent original, the slightly larger 'copy' and subtle embellishments on the original in the copy as a private dialog between the viewer and actor.

Now comes the most elaborate, excessive and fun of this type of hyper-irony. Neil Jordan has played with us before, even when his chancy films didn't succeed. 'In Dreams' has some of the most chilling scenes I know, the underwater architecture of a parallel world. 'End of the Affair' was multidimensionally self-referential, employing -- even stretching! -- the amazing Mrs Moore's ability to inhabit several persons in the same body. Even 'Vampire' echoed Tarkovsky's notion of constructed memory (down to the use of Domiziana Giordano as 'mother').

This is a copy of a precious film. It is in fact all about copies: the paintings, the copy of Bob in Paulo, how he manipulates the idea that he will copy his past crimes, the copy of the vault in the Russian's warehouse, even the copy of the copies on its walls, the twins, the copy of Philip in Phillippa, the false copy of the plan planted in the snitch. Lots of copies, lots of similar references to repetition. 

Also lots of focus on observation: the cop, the cameras, the remote computer trick and the inclusion in the cast of three filmmakers noted for their 'observational' stance. Everyone is watching someone else. Most of all, we have Anne as the proto-observer who anchors our own narrative perspective. She is us: eager for sense, visiting a new world, unsure of how things will unfold, magnetically drawn to the 'real thing' despite its attendant obsessions and fictions. This young actress is one of the luckiest I remember, having so much attention paid to her by makers of the film. The whole enterprise is about her (and us). Nolte knows this. He's not at the level of Moore, but he sure as heck knows what's going on and supports it.

Along the way, there is copious color, fakeout stories, flatout love of the camera and style of life -- a pleasant conflation of rich living from one man's letting the world define him, together with a masterful manipulation of us in our defining of the character and film based on past film memories and templates.

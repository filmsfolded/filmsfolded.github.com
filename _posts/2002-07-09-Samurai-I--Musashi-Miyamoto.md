Spoilers herein.

I am increasingly convinced that actors cannot make a successful film, no matter what. A recent experience is seeing 'Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,' followed by 'Tortilla Soup.' Soup is a remake of Eat Drink. Now the first film is not a life-altering experience, but it has a center, a soul that is nurtured by many small energies. Tortilla has the same script and an example as well, but it is as flat as a high school musical. No magic, no life, no real director.

Here we have a similar experiment. Mifune can be a powerful actor. He _does_ present a life-altering presence in several Kurosawa pictures, including a samurai film in this same year. In Kurosawa's hands, with his protections, Mifune can race. It is one of the best partnerships in film history.

But see what a mess we have without a real director! This is a TeeVee quality soap opera. There has not one redeeming feature, save as yet another samurai source (Yoda) for 'Star Wars' to borrow. Watch Mifune on the bridge when he decides to leave his love. There is no emotional shaping, no tentacles into our hearts. Then watch this same scene stretched into a whole movie in 'Hidden Fortress' and marvel at how each visual effect amplifies the dilemma. Or for that matter, look at the ending bridge scene in 'Crouching Tiger.'

This film is the Japanese equivalent of 'Highlander.' Don't waste your time on it unless you wish to see a great actor unmanaged.

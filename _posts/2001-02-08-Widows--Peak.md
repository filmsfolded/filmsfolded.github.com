Spoilers Herein.

This is pretty thin Irish tea -- a light amusement. Joan Plowright does her patented old biddy. Mia does a charming if inauthentic accent.

 I just couldn't get two other pictures out of my mind. 'Enchanted April' had l precisely the same feel and approach but with more subtle intrigue. It had Plowright and Broadbent together in much the same conjunction. It was made only two years prior.

But one of the most memorable films ever was 'Drowning by Numbers.' It had three women, including Plowright and Joely, Miranda's sister. I think the drowning son at the end of this film could only have been a reference to the end in Drowning, which also featured a town's gossip about a Richardson girl drowning someone. That was in 1988.

JP would recreate her role as head of a widow's club in 1999, in 'Tea with Mussolini.' It all seems to be glimpses through different windows into the same house.

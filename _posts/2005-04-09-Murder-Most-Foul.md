These adaptations aren't very good, though Rutherford is a charming character, quite unlike Christie's Marple though. 

The one thing that makes this interesting is the simple fold of a play within. Sometimes Marple goes under cover in a sense. In the last Marple, she became a maid in the suspected household. In this one, the character played by the actress plays an actress in order to play detective. That bit of complexity is carried over from Christie's story.

The folding is more labored and blunt than in the original (Poirot) story, but still rather amazing in abstract layering of narrative.

Ron Goodwyn's little jingle for Marple may be the best thing about this series. It seems to have stuck, because I detect it in the later Marple and Poirot editions.

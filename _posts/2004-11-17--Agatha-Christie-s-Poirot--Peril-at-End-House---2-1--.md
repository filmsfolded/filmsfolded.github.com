The 'Suchet' Poirot series is wildly uneven because they bring in a different creative crew for each one. This time they used Rennie Rye and company and got the best production values of the lot. And they have the striking Polly Walker, someone with amazing film presence, what they used to call glamor. See her in '8 1/2 Women.'

Though they shift the production artists from Poirot to Poirot, they repeatedly use Clive Exton as the adapter. He performs murder on these lovely story-games. He insists on jettisoning all clues so we can play the game. Instead, he follows the 1930's B-movie convention of surprising us at the end. And he has transformed Hastings into the same buffoon the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes series created with the similarly maligned Dr Watson.

Shame. An entire collection of stories ruined, because who will do them again after this? Oh well, you can see our enchanted Polly here and an equally beguiling location.

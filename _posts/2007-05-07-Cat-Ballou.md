Its hard to appreciate this today. It was before Butch and Sundance, before the US saw Fistful. Before even Bonny and Clyde.

It is, I think our first mainstream Hollywood movie influenced by the (French) new wave. You might not see because it is buried under the reinvention of the Western, a lather of comedy and the greetings of sex, such as they were for the era. And of course, you might not see it because of the roles taken by the two main actors since; she as a lighting rod for upset over social failure, he as target for girlfriend's extortionist lawyer.

But there's value in here. Oh, the movie is entertaining enough in its own way, but you never watch these old important things without revisiting its place in the genealogy of mind. 

Books, its all about the word. We have a virginal schoolmarm turned outlaw. We have a book about a gunslinger turned (reluctantly) into a human rendition of the same (in the process, killing his other self). In an unrelated scene, we literally have a gun come out of a book. We have the words of a ballad become the movie, at the same time we see the movie begin as a hand turning pages in a book (that a geezer reads).

Its Titian brought to the west on a train. Its notions of self-reference made tame and in the service of embedded story. Its odd how much more deft these were than their French counterparts.

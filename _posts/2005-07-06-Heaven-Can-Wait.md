A good story will charm even the devil.

Here's an uncharacteristically layered story. It has a thread of reality which we only peek. A man has been bad all his life. He's lied and cheated and as a result he's been sent to the anteroom to Hell where his case is reviewed.

He's given the option of telling his life and his version is what we see, a layer on top of that reality. In this layer, everyone loves him in spite of his lies, including his wife who ages little in 25 years. This version is rosy enough to convince the Devil to send him elsewhere.

The power of this story is reinforced just before it starts. A shrill woman with poor storytelling skills gets quickly sent through the floor to the flames.

Because this is somewhat formulaic, there's a small summary of the story embedded within, a well crafted comedy bit about the Katzenjammer Kids. Seems the week before, the Captain was entombed in an inescapable barrel. The comic this week (in a drawn out explanation) shows how he escaped. Something about a snake.

Casual viewers may wonder what this little play within the play is for. It is completely out of the mainstream of the story and is the only scene not directly concerned with our hero's life. Its there because the 20th Century rulebook said all big stories need a miniature version of itself within. Alert viewers will remember that everything we see is supposed to a remembrance of a life told to the Devil and everything except this would have been personally experienced by the narrator. So it really stands out because he cannot have recalled this.

Well, our hero escapes the barrel by telling the snake a story, and a good one (though the pacing is slow by today's standards).

Along the way, we get some of the lushest sets I've ever seen. It is as if all the cheap ornamentation of the dames in his memory have gone into decorating his imaginary barrel.

Without all the frippery, both the Kansas and New York staircase/foyers looked mighty familiar to me. Did I recognize the "Unsinkable Molly Brown" and "All About Eve" houses, respectively?

Spoilers herein.

I sought this out shortly after the events of 11 Sep 01. More than any other type, war pictures are a construction of the surrounding culture: attitudes about justice, ideals and evil: notions of the heroic; definitions of the national character.

I particularly wanted this film because it was a 'traditional' war film (focus on battle, not POWs or criminal commandos), and its scope starts with Pearl Harbor. What amazes at first is how horrible is the acting; Wayne is now solidly a joke: only Fonda and Neal are genuine masters. The effects are particularly daft, but one can forgive that... mostly.

The key for me was the construct of the hero. As the captain, he _was_ the ship. The crew, the command and logistics support were simply parts of his uniform, incidental. Training, preparedness, teamwork aren't part of the mix. Professionalism is scoffed at. The 'initiative' which makes Rock a leader is 1) Personal drive, even when it puts everything at risk 2) The ability to misinform the system 3) A failure to die. What is supposed to make him attractive is his doggedness and his 'soft' side, displayed in a confused backstory of his affair with a nurse, his support for a flawed subordinate and his strange relationship to his son. These three characters interact with more complexity than is seen on the battlefield, and it is notable that the at least there the moral equation is simple. (We never see a Japanese face, nor for that matter do I recall an Africa-American.)

This picture of an American Hero wouldn't resonate at all today, even before the WTC strike -- even in my town which has a huge Navy base and a thousands of retired Naval officers.

But even stranger is the picture of women in wartime. Of course they are nurses (and one aircontroller). We have the slut (who gets hers), the maternal center, and the girl next door. All staples. But here, the girl next door gets raped and kills herself in a context which seems as alien today as the Wayne 'heroism.'

Even for Americans preparing for war (as this is written), it seems we've come along way. Films still manipulate, but the acceptable context seems more mature. The next nightmare from Bruckheimer will be the real test.

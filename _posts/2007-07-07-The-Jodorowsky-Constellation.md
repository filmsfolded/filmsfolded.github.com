I look forward to Jodorowky's later films. They've been recommended to me by people I trust.

But in the meantime, because I've seen this celebration of his greatness, I'm skeptical. Its because the guy sounds dumber than I think his films will be.

Its a common phenomenon, I think. Great filmmakers typically say less than enlightening things. Partly, I think it is because they are asked such trivial questions. Also that they have to "explain" themselves so they invent simpleminded stories for general consumption. Perhaps they even believe them. 

But usually, these folks aren't very articulate verbally. I think that is why they are driven to cinema. Films that change lives can only come from someone fully in the thing, and that comes from urges. There's talent and insight in the mix of course, but its the urge that matters here. The less possible it is for an artist to convey something in words, the more he or she is driven, obsessed, with revealing it in another media.

So I expect these interview things to be relatively useless except for perhaps historical reasons. But this one is worse than usual because of the guy's theatrical background. He's created a persona and some trivial catchphrases. He's fully internalized them, and in the end he convinces me that he cannot do anything meaningful.

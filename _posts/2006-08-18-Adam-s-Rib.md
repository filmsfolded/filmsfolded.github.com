I usually don't like Kate. The entire equation is backwards.

The way I would like it to be is that someone envisions some work that connects with us, that has whatever value you might suppose. Ideally its more than just the slightest amusement, but even simple amusements can be worth experiencing if crafted well. But you have to start with the notion of what makes for an effective connection with the viewer.

If it were a manufacturing business, you'd think in terms of what really would make people's lives better instead of what you can trick them into buying.

What we have here is the equation turned on its head. You start with two actors with some box office appeal. Kate had engineered projects specifically designed for her narrow strengths since "Philadelphia Story" and this was merely one in a long string. This project starts with Kate and Spence and ends with them. The whole thing is based on wit, sparks, warmth that is supposed to be genuine.

The basic problem is that they just aren't very rich people. They're stupid and uninteresting in fact.

This bald fact is rubbed raw in the script, put together by a couple friends who were not professional writers. It drifts from one center to another. It depends heavily on timing, the sort of comic timing in "His Girl Friday" and that neither of these actors would ever touch in their entire careers. They are laconic readers who don't lean into their lines. They patiently wait their turn and mess up the beat.

"African Queen" was designed the way I need. Not this.

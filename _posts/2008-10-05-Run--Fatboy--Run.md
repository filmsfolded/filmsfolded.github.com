This is yet another in a long line of films that works on the notion that athletic achievement has something do with success in life, or inner understanding or even successful relationships (which in movieland is simple love).

So we have a story about an unathletic dweeb who... well, you know the story. Hilarity and sweetness ensues.

You have to be pretty hard up to buy into this, to allow this to help you define how you approach love and life. It isn't just the movie that is bankrupt. 

But there's something about this worth commenting on. 

Thandie Newton.

There, I've said it. Regardless of how inane and even dangerous this movie is. No matter how wrong the ideas and vacuous the humor and therefore the soul of thing....

No matter how empty it is. It has Thandie.

Now here is a question: why should this matter? She's pretty, but hundreds or starlets are.

You should know that your commenter is male, and old enough to wonder about beauty. And even though this movie is absolute trash, she is enough of a magnet to keep one engaged. At least some folks.

My theory is that if a woman (never a "girl") has something in the range of some ideal of features and frame -- the specific are vague -- then she can pretend to beauty and achieve it. Thandie is within that range genetically, but I think the allure isn't physical -- its a matter of entering a seductive space. I'm sure that If I met this person outside of the screen, I would be unimpressed. Its the character she assumes here/ It has something to do with a perkiness that appears internal, an emotional alertness that is advertised, A centering in self that assures us that she is a genuine prize.

Spoilers herein.

Here's what I like about this: it is a story about a quirky performer, who lives life as if it  were one of his quirky shows. At the same time, Quaid's performance is itself quirky -  along the lines of Depp's 'Fear and Loathing.' The whole thing is a Punch and Judy doing  a Punch and Judy.

It gets my appreciation for that. But at root, it just isn't a very interesting story: part rock  history, part trailer trash romance, and part holy/nasty metaphor. But then, that's pop  music I guess.

There is a scene that sticks: Jerry Lee opening for Chuck Berry. Chuck is an ordinary guy,  someone whose life is not his performance. Music is just a job, and he would never get  the whole reflexive passion thang. Jerry goes nuts, literally setting the piano on fire. Then  he marches off with 'Follow that, Killer!'

The actor's expression is priceless. Almost worth the admission by itself. He is supposed  to be the surrogate anchor for us, watching from the sidelines.

There's another image worth keeping. Our vulnerable Winona packs up to move in with  her new 'husband.' Her luggage is a dollhouse. That's a sweet keeper, just like Julia  Style's little box of 'needful things' in 'Hamlet.' And for the same reasons.

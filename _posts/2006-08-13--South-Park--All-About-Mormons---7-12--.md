I love this stuff. It isn't because it is sharp commentary that cuts pretty deep. Its because these guys have found a new set (a slightly new set) of abstractions for telling a story.

Look at how efficiently they weave a narrative and the perspective on it at the same time -- two conflicting perspectives at that.

Its pretty miraculous. There aren't many talented storytellers around. To be effective, you have to invent your own way of telling a story. I know of only few outside movies: these guys and Garrison Keillor perhaps.

If you happen to be able, see this. These guys have invented a new form of storytelling that taps into myth. And in this case they tell a story about someone who does the same.

And they keep the jury out on whether it is worthwhile.

Spoilers herein.

I missed something. I was impressed by Ginger Snaps. It was clever, cinematic, hip. 

What does this have to do with that? The original has more to do with 'Go' than 'Cheerleader Autopsy.' So what is this?

Not much. Names, actresses, some passing involvement in wolves, but not at long like the wolves of menarche.

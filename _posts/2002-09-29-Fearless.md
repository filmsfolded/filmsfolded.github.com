Spoilers herein.

This is the thinnest of excuses for inserting action scenes of different types. The approach is that kind used by TeeVee: we all know the artifice and play along for the sake of the stunts. This one is self-referential in having the main character be a stuntman. The drama stems from a stunt gone wrong, apparently intended to add to the risk of what we see afterwards which we all know will turn out okay.

Along the way, we have various movie-type love stories.

I'm interested in the way that redheads are used, especially in films like this. The stuntwoman who is killed is a redhead, as is the girlfriend in the second love plot, and also as is the sister's love child.

In my book, Spielberg made one movie worth watching: "Close Encounters." Its in the French tradition, and really has some depth. Afterwards, he had a disastrous "1941," and then his adventure with George Lucas, someone who actually understood how to center on entertainment first.

Afterwards, we've been served nothing but polished, empty entertainment, cinematic junk food. This is his first of that period since Lucas. Its amazing success worked against us all because it froze this possible talent in a worthless mode.

Seeing it today makes me notice its flaws. The impending doom of the "scientists." The goofy bike chase. The pretend mom. The backstory about the father who abandons his family. The character of the two boys. None of this works. Its almost Ed Wood category.

There are three things that do. The jokes of course. The endearing creature. And third was something of a surprise. Drew Barrymore.

I actually think that if she had been replaced by someone else, this movie wouldn't have worked as well. She's the anchor. The whole story is anchored in innocence and though she has a minor role, she embodies that innocence. 

She's gone on to have a rather influential and successful career. As I write this, she is actually someone in the industry who knows her craft, understands her limits, readily exploits her strengths and seems to do intelligent and hard things.

Its sad seeing this, watching a filmmaker die (represented by the "scientist" who can only watch and record while important things happen without him). But its rather wonderful seeing a youngster ready to replace him.

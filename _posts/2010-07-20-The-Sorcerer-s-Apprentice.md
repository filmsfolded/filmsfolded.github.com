One reason films will persist for a very long time is because there are so many places one can touch a film and have it stick to you. You can like the noise and thrill, or the engaging nature of the characters, or the appeal of the world and its cosmology, or many other things. 

I've been taught a law about this -- the law of the required first. For something to bind to you in an important way, it has to be the second thing you touch. The first thing may attract you, or merely be the closest to you. A successful film (or anything that goes to compose a human) will have to have both: that first landing place that releases you and sends you in the direction and scent of the second, into which you penetrate. 

This is a profoundly junky film, which is to say that it is typical Bruckheimer. You will likely leave the theater a bit disgusted, especially if you saw "Inception" first. But there is something very appealing about this. Almost by accident, they seem to have stumbled upon an attractive cosmology, and a very well put together story structure. Everything about the telling of the story fails, but the spine of the thing is sturdy, right. 

Evil is an invented concept, comparatively quite modern. Even more recent is the notion that it can be vanquished or countered by human activity. We need this in our lives, and seek out anything that reinforces it. We invented a sort of counter-noir of an ordinary schmuck that gets caught in this grand battle and wins by inherent goodness (and some dedication). He gets the western equivalent of the 72 virgins. 

I liked this film, in spite of its crass, cheap fakery. I think that for me the initial touchpoint was the anti-noir hero bit. I'm not immune to that -- I suppose few people are because the more you work to avoid being manipulated, the more of a hero you allow yourself to be. But that initial landing is inadequate, and we release ourselves from it in the first 15 minutes, enough for the first action scene to play out. 

The thing that sticks for me is the well-conceived notion of love as containment. Everything here is about containment. We have the Russian dolls, the so-called grimhold, in which successive layers of sorcerers are locked, surrounding the innermost evil. We have that woman contained in another's body. The two warring men spend a decade locked in a vase. The ultimate battle is to be held against the dead released from their containment. Much is made of being IN the shoes, IN the Faraday cage and IN a magical circle. 

This may be too subliminal for most, but for me it really colored what it means when the characters say they are in love and that love drives them. This is the second touchpoint, the place where I entered this film in spite of its ugly self. 

And it allowed me to appreciated the rather remarkable set that was designed as Dave's lab. They could have used the camera in a more modern, spatial way, especially during the sparkmusic. But it was rewarding enough. Someone bright gave us two action sequences in subway stations so that we would register that lab to effect. 

Similarly, the self-referential nature of the thing as a film is helped by two rather cool joke references to other films: "Star Wars" and "Fantasia."

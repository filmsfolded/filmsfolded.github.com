This was the last of four, and by this time the producers knew they had a dead fish on their hands. They tried quite a few things. They turned Rigg's hair red. They increased the level of obnoxiousness in her character, including more time when she spoke directly to the audience. And more of that talk was "character foible" rather than plot comment.

And this time they worked in as many extreme plot devices as possible: the loyal chauffeur's daughter threatened; a twist in the identity of the hooded villain; stronger hints of romance for our detective and sexual swapping elsewhere; an impossibly cute little girl and ancient mysticism.

The plot is one of those that depends on a certain person ordering scrambled eggs in the middle of the day, then slipping on a lemonpeel as a motorcycle goes by and certain other accidents all aligning miraculously.

They really pulled out all the stops on this. I guess even with all they tried, the reports came back: we hate this, it is horrible, kill it.

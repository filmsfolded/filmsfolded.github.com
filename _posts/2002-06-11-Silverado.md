Kasden is an interesting writer. He is completely without imagination. No crime there. He is instead a craftsman, an engineer. If all you want to do is take up space pleasantly, that's good enough

This is fun, but the reason it is fun is because is because it is all borrowed from pictures we like: the 'High Noon's and 'Seven Samuri's of our collective film memories. 

The question is not whether this film entertains (it does), but whether it entertains in a way that reduces or enhances our ability to be entertained next time. It think, like most other formula projects, it reduces it. That's because the mind seems to have only two modes: recognition and learning.

In a formula picture, you see familiar icons behaving in expected ways. You are pleased because you are assured. The more assured and comfortable those images, the happier you are in your conceptual cocoon. So these film experiences actually suck the life out of our imagination. They are, in fact, the equivalent of the oppressors that figure in so many of them.

The only thing that saves these in the modern era are actors that overlay irony. Someone like Kline who looks at you as if to say: 'look, I'm playing this stupid, one-dimensional cartoon, but both you and I know what it is, wink wink nudge nudge.' Kasden provides this opening by allowing Kline to fall in love with a plain-looking dwarf. It is only slightly against the template: she is a saloon owner with a heart of gold, but enough to allow a silver, sliver of self deprecation.

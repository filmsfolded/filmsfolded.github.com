This is at least an interesting story, but everything about bringing it to the screen is incompetent, save Debbie Reynolds' voice.

The animation was crude even for its time, and the songs have no heft or hook.

But the story! 

If you don't know it, here it is:

A pig with no particular value is the focus. It is made clear that this is actually someone (yes, we are talking about people here) with fewer gifts than the average. He's a runt and would have been killed at birth. Throughout, he never grows into someone that can accomplish anything. This is a key element of the setup. In your normal children's story of the era, all beings are special, extraordinary: The ugly ducking becomes a swan. The chargirl becomes a wise queen. The younger brother solves the mystery.

But here, this pig has no special qualities at the beginning, nor at the end. It is important that he be completely worthless, a simpleton, throughout the story. Otherwise, the "nothing should be killed regardless how worthless" device to work.

The magic of the story is that he is saved by an effect that has nothing whatever with his doing. Something else creates a word not even of his choosing -- he doesn't even know what it means. People, instead of marveling over the spider who can read, write and speak, instead read the words and assign its meaning without question or examination of the "story channel" through which it came.

This is a very peculiar phenomenon, now much tested in a scientific way. We usually think of it in terms of "if its in paper (or on TeeVee) it must be true." But the perceptual flaw is deeper. If it is in words; if it is a story, we accept the reality of it.

That makes this is a tiny essay on the main tricks of misdirected value in storytelling and hence film-making. That people accept it as a children's story, sort of proves the point now doesn't it?

Gosh. I figured Spielberg could at least make another fun movie. To warm up, I rewatched Bladerunner in the new cut. Its the only time in my estimation where his weaknesses as an actor were right for the project. In that film, he was a manufactured person, and neither his character nor self knew. It makes his lack of inner integration with the narrative work.

Gosh again. I figured that with much of the money and power in Hollywood they could pull together something that works. Except for one instant, I never fell into the movie. I was always aware that I was watching a tired old man who wasn't having any fun... in a film made by another tired old man who insists on practical stunts but has no new ideas.

I found only three things interesting. One was that scene that captivated me and the accompanying effect. Its of a ground-level nuclear test in Nevada, based on Plumbbob. The tests from an earlier period really were set up as shown, with cities built only to see how they might be destroyed. We have films of that destruction. And we have films of real fireballs. But these are from a distance. Here we have the same scenes filmed as they likely were, but from perspectives that are humanly impossible. 

You know why this impressed? Because once someone makes an effect like this, of something we know but have never "seen" before... and if it is done well enough as this is here.. Then that becomes the basis for everything that follows. This is, in fact, our first real nuclear explosion. And I was there.

I was impressed by Spielberg's loyalty. Using Karen Allen gets a small smile from those of us who were thrilled with the first movie. But she's a drag. In a way you can appreciate that this was made primary by a rich guy to amuse himself. And that's interesting.

The third thing? The portals of the temple.

Cate was a disaster. Here's one of the best actresses in the world, coached to play a bad actress in a cartoon role with no introspection. Indy is supposed to do all the winking.

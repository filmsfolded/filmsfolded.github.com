Sometimes the way a film is structured, the story is so automatic, so determined that all you can do is watch the actors. The most interesting time for me is when the actors are doing something remarkable -- some representational, emotional gymnastics, or some collaborative kinematics.

But most times its just as it is here, you watch the actors not because they are doing anything interesting, but that they were in interesting projects. The nature of the enterprise here (vampires, kids) references stories outside the movie, so this character- by-reference idea is natural.

Pamela Gidley is the human mom. She was "the girl" in Figgis' ambitious project about space fugues: "Leibestraum."

Alice Krige is the vampire mom. Fantastically attractive, she has been in both a Maddin and Quay Brothers film, both in roles that you will never forget. Here she is made up as a vampire version of Queen Elizabeth, modeled more on Jenny Runacre's Elizabeth than the portraits or more conventional looks. Check the shape of the hairline to see that yes, this is Derek Jarman's Elizabeth turned from counterculture punk to vampire queen.

Richard Grant was (and will always be) Withnail, and is also burned in my mind as interloper of the most outrageous orrery in film in "Hudson Hawk."

And hey, here's Anna Popplewell as the preteen love interest. We just saw her in an equally vacuous movie ("Wardrobe2") now with breasts as the teen love interest. Her development and carriage seems worlds away.

How the mind wanders.

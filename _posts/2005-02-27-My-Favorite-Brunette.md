After Hope had established a franchise with the "road" pictures, studios scrambled to extend its reach. 

This may be the most interesting direction they took. I'm not a fan of Hope's faux zaniness. Its all too artificial: when we see the baby, we know we'll see some excess like a bitten finger. But this story is framed as a parody (not a spoof, something that has less respect for the template) of a particular type of noir film -- the hardboiled detective bit.

Except for the kiddie sequence (which is important to the story), it starts out rather well as a parody. But after twenty minutes or so, the routine TeeVee quality skit level kicks in. If you like the standard Hope routine, you'll like it from there on out. The only part I liked was Lorre trying to place a ring where Hope would find it and being foiled over and over.

But the beginning is fine and of interest in the history of noir. When the studios dictate a parody, the genre is mature.

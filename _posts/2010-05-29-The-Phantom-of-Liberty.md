I have little appreciation for Bunuel, I admit.

He is an amazing filmmaker, with a consistency and control that impresses. The integration of unexpected shifts -- sometimes cinematic, and self-described as "surreal" are the foundation for films that matter to me. It is just that I feel his concerns are trivial, that the focus on a critique of society with the critique being as flawed, as superficial.

There is one quality of this film in particular that I would like to recommend: the seamless continuity across many episodes and characters. I don't know if it originated with him, but it is now widely used to escape the constraints of a single character and give us larger long form.

It allows humor and puzzlement to be spread as comment.

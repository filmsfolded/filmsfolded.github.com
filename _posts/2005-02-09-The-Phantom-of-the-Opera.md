Orson Welles famously turned his version of Othello into a film about architecture -- the sets become characters. When Greenaway did The Tempest, he did the same, more lushly: the building as mind housing books, one of which is written as we watch.

Branaugh in his Hamlet attempted the same effect in Ophelia's madness scene, indeed even borrowing Welles' madhouse set from "Lady from Shanghai," and the rolling camera from "Marienbad" -- invented by Verny in that film and resurrected by Greenaway. 

Since then, the idea has become something of a trend in Hollywood, used even in one of the Harry Potters and the Depp Pirate movie.

Schumacher is something of a thug in how he makes movies, but someone got to him on this score of making the building the star. In this case, it is apt to the story and pulled off with near-Lurhman intensity.

The setup is this (at least in the book): we have a talented young girl who is cursed by twin demons: the devil of her art and the mundane attractions of "normal" sex. As with the projects noted, the building is her mind and soul with her lover controlling the roof and her devil the cellars. 

The first merger of self and building we see is her literally entering a mirror, Alice in Wonderland-wise. The production design was heavily influenced by Gilliam's "Munchausen," another play about a play that is really a voyage through a soul -- even copying a few of the statues. Gilliam's movie is in turn based on "Les Enfants du paradis," which has a similar structure. This is the origin of most of the shots or the stage machinery.

The building is not only featured in the story, but by the way the camera includes features. Many times the features are in the foreground (often out of focus) as well as the background, literally wrapping the action. 

All the bombastic rest of it, especially the music, would have been the empty excess most of the critics noted. But if you know the role of the building, just consider the rest of it the kind of gaudy decoration the French would have draped on a cursed soul of a building.

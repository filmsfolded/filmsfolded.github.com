Spoilers herein.

I liked this. It was intelligent. It was competent. It was cinematic. It was post post- feminist sex-as-joke smart. It was original in its perspective on the unoriginal nature of film.

There's a reason that this ended on a stage -- it is placed as a movie about movies. Of course most movies today are, but this one carves out a unique niche. "Hulk" was equally intelligent but it respects the cinematic mechanisms it exploits. "Moulin Rouge" was much more intelligent but added a vicious intent: to demolish the genre.

This one is in between: it doesn't demolish, it exploits so extremely yet subtly that we have the choice ourselves. But just along the way, the makers wanted us to know that they were aware: so we have the stage, the "observe" atory (used before, notably in the selfreferential "Bowfinger"), the goof on "Maximum Extreme 2," the reference to the TeeVee show by bringing Jaclyn back as Jaclyn. Within this, we have a constantly accelerating series of references to other films: when they got to "Black Narcissus" meets "Star Wars" I had to completely surrender and let the flow of cinematic microorgasms wash over me.

I love this stuff. Yes it is fluff, but it is fluff that intelligently walks the line between masterfully executed fluff and a parody of fluff. Bruce Willis invented this genre, at least in this Summer movie form, and it is extra cool to see him (and Demi!) dancing through it. I credit Drew Barrymore for this, and -- mark me -- when the long view is written, this film will be important and she will be remembered as our K Hepburn. She is the one who invents this film, who monitors its balance.

Here's a side issue: when the counterculture of the sixties was being forged, its key notion was that for the first time in celebrity we had not a single role model but a compound one. In the Beatles, we had four complementary beings melded into one. That quaternity fascinated because while everyone chose an individual among the four to emulate, they were inseparable. As the ambition of that era faded, we reverted back to single roles: the typical high-schooler had seven (or so) to chose from.

Drew is moving back into that mode, or at least referencing it. Here we have the cute one, Cameron, who out-Julias Julia Roberts in working that smile. She's supposed to be dumb, the sexy Ringo. We have Lucy (no diamonds here), who is a fascinating character. Ostensibly the genius, ostensibly the most graceful and beautiful one, she is presented as the one tied to the movie world (with her celebrity Dad and boyfriend). But as everyone knows, she's an intolerable bitch, nearly impossible to work with. In fact, the only reason we have the clueless Bernie Mac instead of the perfectly self-aware Bill Murray is because she drove him away. Just think about this: no amount of money could bring him back, and we're talking big bucks here.

And we have Drew, Drew the mastermind who is both IN this and creating it. Who has left the world of hedonistic drugs so although radiantly healthy is relatively chunky compared to her anorexic buddies. Who never had the camera-loving sweetness this movie celebrates but who shows up anyway as if to say so what? Who does a Willis tenfold in winking at us and saying: ain't it a gas and I can wiggle my butt too. (Though it got a little labored with the intelligently conceived but incessantly drummed "Hell on Ass" bit.)

These days, I try to watch films in pairs. My partner for "Angels2" was "Gremlins2." Check it out, seriously. Gremlins2 was a similar walk through other films, similarly balanced between nearly taking itself seriously and dumping on itself with religious fervor. Similar goof on pulchritude.

Opening sequences are promises. This one, with the extreme continuous pans (borrowed from the similarly situated "The Player") told me right away what a clever goof this would be.

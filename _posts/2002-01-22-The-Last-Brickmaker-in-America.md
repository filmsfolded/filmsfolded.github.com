Spoilers herein.

I have no idea who thinks people will be attracted to such things as this: US society has entered a phase of romanticizing Blacks like we did Native Americans. Dangerous business that. And there really is a sector of society that soaks up, even needs the thin platitudes one finds trotted out here. Everyone is noble -- everyone is finally correcting a prior error. The destiny of everyone in the world is optimistic.

That such a thing exists should give us concern about our own intrinsic hope as a people. Anyone who needs this treacle is seriously sick.

Spoilers herein.

Once again, we have a movie that is more exciting in its basic ideas than satisfying in its execution. But those ideas are worth exploring: telling a story through character-imagined flashbacks where all the major characters are creative artists. Each of the characters presents according to their narrative constraints. The guy is a photographer, so works with movie- based images. Indeed the whole thing could be seen as a movie fantasy played out in a glance at a video shop. The original love is a dancer, and is limited to a narrative bound by physical presence.

The alternative love is an actress playing an actress. More, just as Josh's film (and drug haze) is folded into this movie, so is Rose's play within the play - which happens to be Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' where lovers' identities are switched... and which contains its own internal folding. 

It is a sweet construction that is more of a complex idea and incomplete sketch than a mature narrative. But it has some strong moments when the Shakespeare play is happening (and unhappening as you see Rose remove her makeup in a backwards application). In comparison, the shoe thing is clumsy.

As it unravels, it becomes a mere con for love. The end is unsatisfactory, radically compromised to be 'happy.' But who loved the strongest? Not the dancer who gave up when she moved away. Not the (very much prettier) boss's daughter who seems resigned to marrying the firm's new blood. Instead, it is the one who commits everything.

Love is always having to say you're sorry, but never needing to.

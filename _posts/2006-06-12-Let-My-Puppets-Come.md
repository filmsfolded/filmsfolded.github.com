Pornography is a strange thing; I mean porn distinct from erotically tinged or even centered film.

Porn by its nature is otherworldly, something that isn't real. The world of most porn has nothing at all in common with the world we live in except for a few words and the common existence of genitals. (Fortunately, surgical modification of those isn't popular yet.) The whole value is in pretending, where erotic art is all about revealing.

So porn might as well be done by puppets, cartoons or computerized animation. The only reason that's not prevalent I suppose is because folks off the street are cheap and plentiful. Well, here's an early experiment, one that fails in all respects except for perhaps humor. At least it is intended to be funny.

The later to be great Peter Jackson did something like this, but with a grosser attitude. This is mostly childish and the emphasis is on jokes. When I enter something like this, my first reaction isn't based on whether the jokes are funny, but whether they are clever and cinematic.

Most aren't, they're at the fifth grade level, which means they are desperate for attention. Some are slightly better: dumb ideas that seem slightly novel with puppets. The first episode is dog-girl, but because they are both equally removed from humanness, the overall effect is worthy of Jack Smith.

Only once, maybe twice is there a truly cinematic effect that takes advantage of the fact these are puppets. Towards the end, a fish, a man, some sex, some eating.

The oddest piece is an appearance by a human girl, a topless dancer who spends ever so long doing what she and many others I guess think is sexy. She looked like a puppet.

I think someone, someday will do something deep in this area. But this, it ain't even fishfood.

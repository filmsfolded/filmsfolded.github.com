I've seen two of these this week, both from the same era and both assuming that some evil person can have hypnotic control over an innocent. Most of these are not worthy of comment, but in this case, the innocent is someone special.

She is the daughter of a famous pianist, someone with passion so intense, it leaves the body and creates an empty husk unable to cope with the world. I know who the pattern for this is. This is a pianist that settles my soul with his abandon. I actually had the opportunity to spend time with his daughter, and she is nothing like the lovely fiction here portrayed.

She is cursed with the soul of her father without his talent. A passion not allowed to disperse, someone who cooks. This is the woman that many of us may fall in love with. Because of this gift, she is suspected of being psychic, strange, vacantly alluring and (because of the era) hypnotically suggestible. 

There is a play within this that is the cause of a murder and which involves this girl. It is clumsily done, but the idea is so sweet that if you are susceptible, you could believe it.

Spoilers herein.

I was impressed by 'Crouching Tiger,' so sought this out. The similarities and differences between the two are striking.

Both have a quality of photography that is wonderful. Enough to justify the viewing by itself. Both have the fights much better integrated into the story than the typical 'action film' from the West. Both have a rather high quality of acting.

What I liked about the Woo film was its more intelligent, dynamic eye. The camera was choreographed as a character, giving a completely different cast to everything. It changes the nature of the narrative, and is much more cinematically sophisticated. The score adds.

But so far as the sophistication of the story is concerned, this is a much deeper and intelligent film. The story is framed in the context of the imposition of western technology into a mature civilization. Movies are a part of that intrusion, in fact arguably the most intrusive. So we already have a self-referential conundrum. It is handled here deftly. The main action is based on a literal stage. That stage, incidentally is on a boat, and boats figure in other elements of the story. The love interest (who really is lovely) in a Chinese woman who travels to the west and brings back -- guess what -- a camera!

So we have a play within a play, which is a rather well-known device. (I wish the play had been subtitled, because I am sure it would have meant something apt.) But we also have a much richer device: pictures about taking pictures. Our first exposure (sorry) is Aunt 13 taking a picture which could have killed the subject were it not for the alertness of the hero. I understand the old man who would have been killed would have been understood by a Hong Kong audience as someone who straddles the Chinese and film worlds.

Later, the central institution is burned, at least the building that houses it: a combination Confucian healing place and martial arts academy from longstanding tradition. While it burns, this woman takes a picture. It is an incredibly rich image: intelligent, rich, lovely, deeply bothersome. At another time, she arranges for her shadow to caress his.

Another element that makes this film rich: Jet Li is a real martial artist, not just a coached actor. The disciplines of martial art and acting overlap, with one amplifying the other.

If you've seen the 2001 remake of 'the Musketeer,' you should see this for the original of the ladder fight scene. This one is fresh and real.

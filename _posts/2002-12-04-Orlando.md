Spoilers herein.

The value in this film is in wondering after the fact where it went wrong. Reminds me of another 'artistic' woman filmmaker who thinks that decoration alone matters, Julie Taymor.

Woolf's work is notable in how she took the emerging notion of self-aware narration and elaborated it. Her stance is one where the narrator challenges the reader: she sets up phrases, small images and local metaphors in such a way that we complete them. using deep-seated assumptions about the ay the world works. And then she subtly shows that completion to have been based on assumptions that embarrass us, usually in ways related to gender. This results in a dual narrative: the story itself which superficially deals with many of these elements, and the shape of the narrative where the real challenge occurs.

This is tough stuff for a filmmaker, and the only transportable solution we have devised is to find an actress (almost always an actress) that can create that dual stance of being the character and also someone halfway between the film and our mind. Brando could do it. Streep sometimes. Today, we have Penn, Moore, Blanchett, and Winslet. (An alternative approach is to honk around with the eye, as with Kubrick, Tarkovsky or -- in places -- dePalma. But this cannot be borrowed by others.)

Sally Potter isn't up to this. She tries a little Greenaway to place a certain abstraction in the lush perspectives, but doesn't seem to know how he places the narrative in the environment. Along the way we get a few nice compositions, but they don't do the heavy lifting we need. Her main strategy is invested in her actress. Ms Swinton is completely outclassed by the nature of the problem: her solution to the dual narrative is to occasionally look at the camera. Those moments -- a long one at the end -- are supposed to substitute for the rich, engaging thrust and parry Woolf puts us through.

Well, they don't. What we end up with is a simple metaphor: 'Forrest Gump' meets 'Boys Don't Cry.' It did have the beneficial effect of sending me back to Woolf. Hope it does for you as well.

By now you know the obvious, that this is a failed remake of a remarkable film. 

You can read from others about the cinematic properties it lacks, the imprecision, the failed pace, lack of urgent focus... Its really bad. Films like this are their own sort of virus. 

What I'd like to remark on is the lack of subtext. I'm not sure one needs such a thing in horror films of this conspiracy-invasion kind. But the original had it and it gave it great power. The context was the cold war and the suspicion that there were silent, secret sleeper cells. That what this (the cold war) was all about was some grand battle between good and evil, but that evil often had persuasion on its side. The "convinced" were effectively brainwashed and thus behaved like zombies.

We use things like this today. I saw a zombie movie (the one with the shopping mall) that clearly conflated Muslim extremists with the zombies, and the recent "Cloverfield" deliberately evoked 9-11.

I'm not sure how one would convey that today with this film and stick close to the original idea. This business of "don't go to sleep." The notion that ADD kids are the salvation of society, somehow the root of what it means to be American. The subtext that psychiatrists matter. The idea that a lowly technician in a local hospital could mobilize and lead a worldwide response. The massive amount of explanation we suffer, particularly at the end.

Kidman has had better days. It has a troubled production history with rewrites and massive reshoots. It shows.

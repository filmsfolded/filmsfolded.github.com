Spoilers herein.

There are a few things I really enjoy in thinking about film. One is comparing remakes and sequels to their originals. Its odd how some work and some don't. And those that work often work for completely different reasons. The Alien series are four films as different from each other as any are from this.

Another joy is comparing projects that fail that have almost the same recipe as those that succeed, or are thought to succeed. This movie features William Powell in pretty much the same character he had in several projects at about the same time. Many, like this one, had A-list actresses. The writing isn't particularly different from one project to the next.

It seems almost that all the others were accidentally good. And this, accidentally good.

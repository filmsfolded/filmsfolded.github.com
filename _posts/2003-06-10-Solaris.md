Spoilers herein.

Tarkovsky is on my very short list of transcendental filmmakers. Some of his films have changed my life. Those masterpieces balance an overall structured ambiguity with complex visual meditations. One would think this film would similarly transform, but it doesn't. It is not as big a failure as 'Sacrifice' but it fails for the same reason.

That reason is because he travels from the worlds he creates and controls. Here it is science fiction in general and Lem's world in particular. With 'Sacrifice' it was to the west in general and Bergman's world in particular. In both cases, the alien world would seem a natural fit for TarkovskyÂ‘s underlying concerns of mind creating realities and yearning for greater perfection based on invented pasts (inexactly called nostalgia by some). Future invented image drawn from past invented image presented through a synthetically imaged present.

The problem is that science fiction (and Bergman for that matter) are too bound to narrative for Tarkovsky's imagination. He likes to capriciously weave huge strands while fraying small ones. He NEEDS to particularize in the instant at the same time he untethers physics. This the is exact opposite of how it works in the worlds he visits.

A relatively insignificant result is that the created future is not convincing as a different world where abstractions are skewed. A larger defect is the general problem of us as viewers working too hard to make sense where we think there might be some instead of just gliding emotionally as we can through 'Rublev' and 'Mirror' and 'Nostalgia.'

Yes this has some fine moments, but that's never been what he is about. I see this as proof that the man was an artist because he wasn't afraid to venture too far and try on unfamiliar environments.

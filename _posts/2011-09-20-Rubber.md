I have a hard time with films like this. On the one hand, it explicitly deals with concepts that attract me. It is very clever and well enough put together. 

But there is balance between art meant to affect you and essays about the process. Nearly all films are a mix if the two -- what I call 'folds.' I like these because I think many of them work to drive the film deeper into my mind. But what if they don't? What if all the elements are there, but they are not assembled for effect, but to attract rubberneckers to a prancing contest? It just seems like I am watching a precocious adolescent French student.

And gosh, this has the brave Roxane Mesquida in a role where clearly she is lost.

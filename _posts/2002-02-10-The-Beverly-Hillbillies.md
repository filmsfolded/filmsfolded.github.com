Spoilers herein.

The original TeeVee show was a goof on stupidity. It was one of the first self-referential comedies where audiences tuned in to poke fun at the stupid, and to do so with humor so lowclass that they ended up laughing at themselves for laughing at the screen. (Contrast that for instance from 'Hogan's Heros' where the stupid guys were somebody else, not even American.)

The TeeVee show was a milestone in American humor, a real advance toward the selfaware irony that is the bedrock of what is common today. This film completely looses the center of where this humor came from, except for a clever moment with Buddy Ebsen.

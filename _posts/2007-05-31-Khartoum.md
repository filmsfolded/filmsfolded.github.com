I really wanted to like this. That's in spite of Heston, a member of the Wayne/Gibson school of thuggery.

The reason I wanted to like it was the assumption that after "Lawrence of Arabia," which is much the same in spirit, we'd get a competent film cinematically. But unlike "Lawrence," this resonates more directly to events in the Middle East and the Horn: Muslim sects at war; racial and tribal revenge; false prophets; flummoxed Europeans in the midst; impending regional collapse.

But I have to say that it is something of a disaster, and probably for the reason of the disaster it depicts. There's a lack of understanding of the place, and an inability to see what we can. I suppose that's old news with the "west" and Islam, but seeing it in bogged down film from 40 years ago is something of an eyeopener.

And it isn't just because we have Heston (who has simple values of good and evil) playing Gordon (who had very much the same flaw). Nor that we have the depressing sight of Olivier in blackface playing Othello with a sort of fabricated tentative nobility. The real false messiah was probably someone with interesting characteristics, someone who would be worth the drama, and all the effort to get that screaming cloth on screen. But this whole film reduces to a few meetings between these two "great mean," their worlds and faiths.

I wish it had been done well. We could use it. It would work, and it could matter. I wonder. Will we ever get any indigenously made films of these events?

The space. The one thing that "Lawrence" did well was establish the relationship of man to desert. This was done cinematically in several ways and it seems to have been less Lean than Young and Coates. But it WAS done. There was a reason for the film. This, well this is just an illustrated Bible story.

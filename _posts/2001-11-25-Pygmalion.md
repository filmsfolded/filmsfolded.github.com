Spoilers herein.

Seeing this and My Fair Lady together was a real lesson for me, a lesson in how a seemingly small change in presentation can completely transform a production. The lines of MFL are precisely those of Pygmalion, plus the Ascot race and some foolery with Dad. The sets of the two are nearly identical. But the effect is radically different.

Shaw's play was about how people are actors, and the supposed class system, indeed all rank in society is a result of how skillfully you play the role. It is a socialist notion, highly intellectualized through the then promising science of linguistics. In other words, this play is a self-referential criticism of the notion of play.

Shaw would have been repelled by the transmogrification into MFL -- because the musical is an exploitation of the medium for sheer entertainment. In other words, MFL is a celebration of the notion of play.

Done with the very same words!

I believe that you need to put roughly the same amount of energy into watching a film as the filmmaker did in making it. Its a rough measure of investment I have. If its a fluffy nothing, then you can play with it as a disposable thing. If the filmmaker actually worked, invented, invested, you should too for better or worse.

This way, I go on many voyages not of my choosing and come out probably better. The rule applies to a different kind of cinematic intelligence than usually used. For instance, this movie.

Superficially it is a simple spoof, of no more importance that a hundred cheap teen movies, even though the better of them do something this one doesn't -- shift halfway from making fun of adolescent urges to exploiting them.

This is intelligent. Jackson hasn't yet learned to make movies that matter. But he sure as heck knows how to make movies that work, and that's something. Because we have to understand it from our side too.

This period had him exploring all sorts of genres, taking each one to excess, each excess in a different direction. Each one novel. Along the way, he delivers some humor from time to time, enough to make you laugh if you are not in on the greater program.

There is one thing he's done for us out of this adventure that matters. He has quite literally reinvented the camera, taking us one more hitchcock-step along.

It is his WETA special effects group who (along with Pixar) have allowed CGI to release us from the physical bounds of the camera, and the vocabulary we expect. You can see some of that here, even though all the cameras are physical film boxes and all the effects are practical or stopaction.

I saw this together with a film from a filmmaker that has mattered in the past. This one was slight in intent and adventurous in method, just opposite from the Herzog film. I liked this one better.

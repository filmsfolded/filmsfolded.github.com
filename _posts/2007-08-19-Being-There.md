Wow.

There are several reasons to watch this. One is to see Shirley's masturbation scene. It was shocking in its day I think. But what's interesting about it is how it was copied by Nichole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge."

Another good thing is the already quaint notions about TeeVee. These were days when there was absolutely no notion that TeeVee was anything but useless, and that watching even a little bit was a sort of trailer park activity. And these were the days before we had a president that if not stupid, speaks as if he is. Sorta takes the edge off this in present terms, but it provokes a kind of sad nostalgia that things would have changed in such a way that the satire here is completely gone. Its as if Lilliputians were my new neighbors.

There's also some very strong staging here, very strong indeed. One scene in particular has two men walking in this fine, rich house, framed in a very precisely architectural way. A long lens flattens the depth. Two servants slowly follow them with wheelchairs at the ready. Its a shot everyone should know.

I have a list of films that are so important or groundbreaking that you really must see them before you die. Everyone probably has a similar list. But no one I know has a list of scenes. Perhaps the movie as a whole isn't wholly transcendent, but some scene is, or some property like an extraordinary set or design.

I wonder why it is that we don't have someone like Peter Sellers today. No Robin Williams, Peter Carey or Steve Martin, none of our race comedians, are anything close. The particular quality I mean is the ability to have a conversation with the audience about the character without the overt winking and theatrics that others who can connect this way do.

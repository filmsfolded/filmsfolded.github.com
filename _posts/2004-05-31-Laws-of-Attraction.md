Spoilers herein.

Well I suppose even the very best actresses sometimes just take any old thing. This actress  really puzzles me. I assume that she doesn't like to be always challenged, and takes periods  of working vacations.

In this case, we have another of Brosnan's pet projects. Here, the game is one of creating  quaint enchantments within the wrapper of a date movie but on the sturdy armature of two  people who hate each other ending in love.

The enchantments are guaranteed with Julianne, Parker and Frances, each of whom are  masters of particular corners of comic charm. Throw in Ireland. Throw in some bizarre  characters - at least they are supposed to be bizarre.

Then build a story with two elements: the nature of the law (and how it 'decides the case)  and the sweet addiction to sweets. But these two elements are only touched upon and not  leveraged at all. These might as well have been politicians or doctors. The idea of the law  and the mirrored mechanics of divorce are mentioned as if the screenwriter knew they were  important. But nothing is done with them.

Perhaps it is just as well. Moore was pretending to be Susan Sarandon here and wasn't in the  mood to be awakened. So we just get a few winks and Irish cuteness from her.

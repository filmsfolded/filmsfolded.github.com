I'm sure you know the story: redheaded ing√©nue is sleeping with three men, each for a career-related purpose. Down and out Pettigrew stumbles on the scene and through natural goodness rights all. As a reward, she is granted her own true love. Along the way we get some wonderful period costumes and a soft antiwar message.

But the thing is put together in a way that you are never unaware that these are two actresses. One plays a character who is acting: we can see that on screen. It is deliberately written that way. The other (McDormand) is playing a character who is NOT acting, who in fact has no guile at all. 

For those who like my terminology, the context is folded, consisting of the multiple lies of Amy's character and the way she overtly plays it. McDormand's performance is folded, because she deliberately never lets us lose sight that she is an actress coming after the unlikely governess role. But the character is separate, unfolded. This is the opposite of the way it usually is, even though everything else (love is found, justice is played, the lead actress is selected) is strictly according to formula.

So its an adventure in subtle twists, and I think our Francis pulls it off. Its an Indian sort of thing, so they found one to direct. 

They cut the bit where the night club owner is revealed to be a German spy and toned down the lingerie voyeurism, Too many watchers.

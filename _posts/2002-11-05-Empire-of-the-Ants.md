Spoilers herein.

Gordon fans misinterpret this, I think. For them, it seems another of the Gordon stripe where something gets big and treatens the innocent.

And sure, cheezy effects, abysmal acting and rock bottom production values. That describes most movies.

But in this one, he stuck more to the Welles's story, at least towards the end after we've gotten most of the 'unlikely group of warriors challenged 20 times' stuff out of the way. What makes this is interesting (at least to me) is that behind the ecoterrorism moral there is a political point that's rather tasty:

Drugs, political fealty, brainwashing, co-opted law enforcement. All set in the form of a movie (the primary form of political shaping today) and set in the sugar plantations we drained from the Everglades to create highly subsidized sugar to freeze out Castro. Now that's rich.

All the Joan Collins radioactive stuff is background noise.

Obligatory helicopter shot at the end. No redheads this time.

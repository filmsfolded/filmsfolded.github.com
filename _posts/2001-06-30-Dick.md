Spoilers herein.

This film caught me just right. It uses the twee dumbness that kids use to make fun of themselves ('Clueless'), or that we use to make fun of them ('Romey and Michele'). That's the distance that is applied to the watergate events, in a very clever way.

I lived through those events as a young adult: they profoundly affected all of us  who thought of ourselves as politically astute. History is never reality, but always digested and shaped by the notions of the sender and receiver, and constrained by the medium used. Apart from point events (JFK assassination, moon landing) Watergate was the first long-term real political development that came to us by TeeVee, was shaped by TeeVee in what happened, and whose historical truth was set by TeeVee. Along the way, tape recordings -- another mundane technology -- played a role, and the whole history was wrapped up in 'final form' in several highly celebrated films.

But no film can be 'true,' no history disentangled from its context. And the context in this case included the shattering of our childish trust and soulful acceptance of platitudes. So instead of getting another Oliver Stone essay which exploits that link between film characterization and the history we want to see, here we have a film that turns it on its head.

The protagonists are trusting children, as dumb as we were and in much the same way. The characters and events are deliberately comic, and likely no further from 'real' than Stone's. But here the distance between what we see and what happened is made explicit -- we know it is not real. This remarkably intellectual cleverness produces a film more true than the others, and of course while watching this one, we see two or more as we replay the others (and our notion of history) in our mind. 

The effect is that this film has the effect of being about how films shape history and our world, in a small way shattering our trust in them.

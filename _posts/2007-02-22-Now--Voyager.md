This is an ordinary drama; lots of heartwrenching situations involving love, children and overbearing mothers, two of them. It was made from a well-selling book of the period. Sometimes movies are merely made from books and that's that. In this case, we are reminded it is a book because we actually see the book's pages turn! Its pretty weird. I know of no other movie from a book that so overtly says "now this next part is a bit boring but it comes from the book, you see, right here in the next chapter."

Bette Davis stars, if that is of interest. She is not believable in the modern sense. But it hardly matters because the character she plays is rich.

Why do we want movies and books about rich people? I believe the reason is something more than the character shorthand we use. Oh we have a doctor here and an architect, each assignment carrying context that we add to the story without having to be shown. But wealth is used as a different sort of shorthand.

Wealthy people can can just do things without refactoring their lives. Want to spend six months at a sanatorium? Want to take a cruise to South America next week? Want to leave the cruise without worry because you know you can take a flight?

Want to adopt a child? Want to defy social conventions with impunity? Just do it, you're rich.

Storytelling is about weaving with ribbons, and it the great challenge of the storyteller to draw these ribbons from reality for us. Its the first thing. Its the most interesting thing. Simply using devices like this seems like a cheat. The story has no value because we know it begins with cartoon conventions.

Edith Wharton is valuable because she stepped into this shorthand and made having a wealthy life as complicated as any life. The ribbons she teased out were newly born. These here are used.

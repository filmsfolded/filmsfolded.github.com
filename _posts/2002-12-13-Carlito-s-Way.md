Spoilers herein.

This is a story of a natural talent, who is punished for being who he is and is enticed to play a game he doesn't want to. That's dePalma.

DePalma's films divide into those he directs 'for hire' and those that spring from his own mind. This is a 'for hire' project.

It still has dePalma's energetic eye: in the framing shots at the beginning and end; in some exhilarating floating sequences at the club; and at the chase up and down the escalators toward the end. This latter would be developed in 'Snake Eyes,' a 'pure' dePalma project. When we are in the opportunistic eye, this is magic.

The problem is in the acting. No, I'm not saying the acting is bad. But when studio bosses assemble these things, often they don't understand the chemistry involved among the various beings certain actors carry with them.

Pacino is a sledgehammer. He's not clever, just loud. Among actors, he is a gangster so it is apt that he plays them. But Sean Penn is a Brando-type being: he projects several personalities at once: always including at least one shadow of the character and himself as actor. It is a whole different way of constructing a story. The story might have been able to accommodate both styles: actually some good films do exploit these differences, but always to the advantage of the clever actor. 'Untouchables' had a writer that knew how to negotiate these risks.

DePalma was constrained, and couldn't synthesize the parts. So he parses the film into three bits: his own art of perception; Penn's creation of projection, and Pacino's noise. By turns, he allows each one some attention as if we were at a three-ring circus. The result is incoherent.

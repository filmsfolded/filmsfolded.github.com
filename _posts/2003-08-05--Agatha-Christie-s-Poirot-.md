Spoilers herein.

The special conventions of the literary mystery evolved in the context of engaging  readers in a context. That notion of engagement must be radically different in TeeVee  and film. The engagement in those media is often in the observation of how things have  changed in the mapping, especially when classic books are adapted.

In this case we have an essentially literary character, one that can only exist in the mind  because he only exists as a figment of effete logic beyond what CAN exist. Never mind,  say film adapters: caricatures are caricatures and we can do that too. There can be some  charm, but there is no bow to the abstract reality of the books.

Oh well. There is one remarkable feature in at least one segment, the otherwise  charmless "ABC Murders." The climax is set in a movie theater that is showing  Hitchcock's "Seventeen." Pretty subtle and effective mapping, that.

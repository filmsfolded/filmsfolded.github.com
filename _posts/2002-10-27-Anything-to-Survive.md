Spoilers herein.

The film business is a strange phenomenon. One can only guess what the economics are behind a project like this. I suppose it has a lot to do with being incredibly cheap to make.

They could have sprung for a better writer though. There are lots of things that could have been woven into this. But what we get: a stubborn divorced Dad; an earnest, questioning jock son, two sisters -- one a crybaby and the other 'at risk.' A few predictable confrontations and trials. Colossal mewing and wondering. A rescue. Ho hum. Guess it would matter if we cared about any of these people.

'You bet, Dad'

Spoilers herein.

This is advertised as intelligent, but that is a ruse. Intelligent films require a narrative dialog with the viewer. This has a few twists, but they come as planned surprises. And nothing here requires much intelligence or insight to suss out precisely as required. No, this is simple amusement.

The play is amusing because it takes good advantage of acting excess, which is what this is all about. Films demand more, and master stager Mankiewicz does his best to add depth to the space, and character to the environment. There's lots of back and forth movement, in and out. There're lots of shots (too many) that try to give roles to the animated toys in the set. But there just isn't enough to work with. It is shame how Hollywood treated Mankiewicz after 'Cleopatra.'

So we are stuck with this as a way for actors to parody outrageous acting while pretending to criticize outrageous writing. One wonders if Olivier knew what he was doing or if he thought he was playing it straight.

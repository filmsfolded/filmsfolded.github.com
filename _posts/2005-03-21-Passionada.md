You may be interested in this merely because Emmy Rossum is so appealing. She has one of those accidental faces that's somewhat over-sized featurewise. But like others (Kyra, Julia) she can light up the area with her smile. But she has more natural range and appeal than they do. And she's helped by another natural, Theresa Russell.

But this story is a disaster. You can see how the writer worked: to the ordinary story of single mother seeking love from a pretender while daughter watches they add stuff. And what stuff: threads about gambling, fishing, cooking, singing and "Latin" love. But none of these threads go anywhere, none of them connect with each other or the main story. The result is a mess. The DVD has an original ending that is entirely apt in its discontinuity, and an accompanying commentary that expresses disgust over that same disconnectedness. Amazing.

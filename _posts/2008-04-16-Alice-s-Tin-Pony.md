Before Micky, even before we worked out what realities we wanted in animation, Disney made this. With his own hand.

The Alice supposed to be Alice from Wonderland. She is a live character superimposed on the cartoon, interacting with drawn objects.

The "tin pony" is a locomotive, and there are lots of sight gags having to do with plastic physics. Walt was responsible for several serious problems in the film world. But this really shows a lot of cleverness and promise.

I don't know my cartoon history, so I do not know how Felix the Cat features so prominently in this.

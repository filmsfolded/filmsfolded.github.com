Poor Jody. I think she is an intelligent woman if not particularly a powerful actress. But she got herself not a bind here.

I think his project started out with more ambition, more ambiguity between the realities in Jody's written stories and her lived stories. I think the original idea was simple, to fold these together, to merge her identity with that of the little girl and that of her ghostly adviser with her father.

It still works if you allow this. But the script as if becomes, Jody herself and the realistic tone of the thing fight you all the way.

The tragedy is not ours as much as it is Jody's. I think she wants desperately to be in intelligent movies. And mostly, she fails as projects change after she has committed. I can think of a few where this is true. That horrible Sagan thing, "Contact." The one where Fincher started with a previsualized architectural movie "Panic Room" and had to change for budgetary reasons to a villain's vehicle. Only "Lambs" and "Driver"worked the way they were supposed to, with meaningful narrative experiment.

The story here has little magic: there are two distinct females: a plucky girl and an obsessive, reclusive woman. One is writer, the other a reader, it hardly matters which. One gets in a fix and the other helps. The order of that also matters little.

It could have been wonderful, worthy of Medem, worthy of our time, worthy of hers. But somewhere along the line the antenna blew down.

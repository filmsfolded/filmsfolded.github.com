Spoilers herein.

I play with movies about movies: representations about representations. And this is just  about the coolest one I've seen in a long time. I really recommend it to thinking  cinephiles.

The original cartoon was simple: some guy in spooky disguise. That's established in the  first sequence here. But then we move into uncharted territory, where we have not  another chapter but a whole different film disguised as a Scooby movie.

In this adventure, there are instead spooks in people, in fact other people in people,  dogs in robots in people, basically every combination possible. At the same time, they  play with the intent: there's a sequence similar to one in 'The Princess Bride' (which is  template for this) where Daphne figures that someone said not to do something, unless  they meant we should, unless you know that we would think so in case.. and on and on  just like Wallace Shawn in his best 'My Dinner with Andre' meets 'Wayne's World'  reversals.

Everything is about goofing on representations -- ironic irony. This literally turns the  Agatha Christie model of mystery story on its head. Every element is subverted in what  may be the most sophisticated film of the year. Shaggy is farting and Daphne petulentaly   interrupts: 'we're here to solve a mystery!'

Incidentally, the cartoon was influenced by graduates of the Disney character lab, so the  five personalities are modeled after the five roles kids could choose to play in junior  high, based on . And the girls are both redheads: one dark, the other light.

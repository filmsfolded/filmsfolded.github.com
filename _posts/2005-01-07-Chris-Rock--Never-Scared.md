Everyone lives in their own movie. We make up that movie from those we see, and many of us don't know it. Some movies are made purely to help us define ourselves and these are necessarily targeted to certain demographics. Nowhere is this more true than in the gay, teen and black worlds.

Chris Rock now sits on the throne between where there used to be two seats, the Bill Cosby and Richard Prior seats. That means he has to alternate between helping Blacks laugh at themselves and animating conspiracies. He must have found a sweet spot: hard for me to judge, I'm sort of a George Carlin kind of guy.

Spoilers herein.

This collection has provided some of the deepest cinematic journeys I have had. And to  think: these are over a century old, are less than a minute each and had almost no prior films  to borrow from. I contend that films these days draw their matter much more from other  films than 'real' life. That certainly cannot be said of this crew, who invent more than just  the machinery.

These very first films were also the very first selfreferential films. They depict the boss. They  depict crowds watching. They depict films being made and shown. 'Depict' is a carefully  chosen word here.

If I saw these when new, I believe I may have dropped everything and joined the community.  This must have been lifealtering for many. It is also one of the last times that a French artist  (excluding Grillet) had anything interesting to say. Absinthe burnout, y'know.

I had to keep playing the painted dancer over and over again. This is one of the most  mindblowing experiences I have ever had.

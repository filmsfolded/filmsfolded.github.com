Spoilers herein.

These two people ceased being actors long ago. Now they are cuteness franchises in by-the-numbers projects. The franchise idea is supposed to be that we know what to expect and consistent quality will be maintained from happymeal to happymeal.

But that's not the case here. The Hugh Grant persona was best exploited in 'About a Boy,' which really was a fine film in several ways. Bullock's best product was 'Miss Congeniality' written by the guy that directs her here in his first outing. Knowing those projects ruins this. Cookie cutter projects are fine unless you know that you are getting inferior.

Bullock commissioned both this and Congeniality from Lawrence, specifically to tailor a vehicle for her cuteness. Her insistence on having him direct kills the project -- he has no sense of visual timing. Jokes on the page are different than on the eye. 

Bullock is now fat, so much so that her character has to be a compulsive eater and wear deliberately non-flattering clothes in a self-aware mockery. She stoops as low as a tasteless diarrhea joke.

But this film is interesting in one respect -- its use of the redhead. Every other female is red, from the RV wife, to the women in streets and restaurants, even to those placed strategically in the baseball stadium. (That stadium scene, by the way, makes no sense after all the emergency cuts made to salvage the movie.)

Bullock's best friend (Heather Burns) is red and of course so is Alicia Witt, who I think was the cause of all the red casting choices. We've been waiting for her to break out for some time now, but this project dims those prospects. That's because she shows the one-sided acting.

For those who don't know, good actors slide their whole bodies into a role. Less good actors control only certain parts of their bodies, for example see how Julia Roberts acts with her mouth and waist and never the much more expressive eyes and shoulders. 

And the really bad actors are constantly thinking about acting, so half of them is the actor and the other half the character. It is a left-brain, right-brain thing and you can literally see that only one half of the mouth is moving. It is a true undeniable test of acting. When you see it, you know the person can't act. Watch Harrison Ford to see the same: one half of the face is watching and moving the other half.

Alas, poor Alicia! We had such hopes for you.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

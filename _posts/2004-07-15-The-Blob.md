Spoilers herein.

I'm not particularly fond of cheesy old horror or petticoats, and I've never thought Steve  McQueen was worth watching. But this small film has a special place in my memory. Like the  superior 'Tingler' of the following year (which I experienced in 'percepto') it is a horror  movie which features a climax at a horror movie. This idea would evolve into many folds  until it hit the complexities of 'Blair Witch 2' or 'Ringu.'

It didn't start here - the notion traces back to Keaton's 'Sherlock Jr.' But as a horror device,  it is in its purest form here, almost as pure as janeygirl.

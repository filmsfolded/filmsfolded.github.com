Spoilers herein.

A truth about horror films is that you don't really visit the world of the story as much as  the mind of the filmmaker(s). If there is a strange and scary mind there, you get creeped  out. If it is skewed in some way, you can pick it up if there is any competence at all.

In this case, we have a story about a haunting, and the camera is placed so that we do  that haunting. The story is irrelevant. Everything is focused on the apartment and the  sailing ghostly eye that observes. We become the ghost.

I saw this when it was new. At the time I was exposed to a project that of all in the world then and since would be closest to this. Not very, not very at all but as close as reality ever got.

We all laughed at the improbabilities. The first of course was that the Soviets could ever have built something as sophisticated as the Americans. Among Soviet deficiencies was the abject impossibility for clever hardware guys to exist, and fundamental software to be created. We were so worried about Soviet bad computers the US arranged for the Soviets to "steal" enough modern computers and decision support software to ensure that their missiles weren't launched by buggy machines.

And then there's the display. Perhaps lights might be used, but that accompanying teletype sound? Oddly, this became so entrenched in Hollywood's mind that you still have it today. And that voice? A machine with such transcendent insight into the laws of nature sounds like Robbie the Robot? Another movie convention.

The original short story if I recall was that some of Forbin's psyche was imparted to the machine and formed the basis for all its creative speculation. That's they way it usually is in these things. That's why the machine allowed sex, because it got a visceral pleasure. And its why they needed each other, even while hating the fact. This is not played up well enough in the film version.

What was novel was that the movie ends with the machines in control, and their mastery inevitable. It makes for a good short story to set this up this way. It makes for a poor long form movie.

Note here that the scientist is carefully cast as a rugged guy with a cleft chin and forward manner, precisely like the President. In fact it was hard for me to distinguish between these two actors.

Forbin spelled backwards is Nibrof.

Spoilers herein.

If you want to understand how you joke with yourself (which is the centerpiece of being) you  need to understand how film comedy works. And for that you have to experience the  inventors: Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle. And deeper yet, the inventor of the inventors, Sennett.  He is that ghost behind the babbling ghosts in your soul.

This is one of Sennett's apprentice films from the period where he was directing... one every  week. They aren't remembered fondly. This is the first I've seen from this period as they are  hard to find, and he didn't write it.

Nonetheless, there are several comic twists in this seven minute story, twisted cleanly. No  sign yet of the frantic.

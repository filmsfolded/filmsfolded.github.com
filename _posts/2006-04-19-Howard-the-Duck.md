Sometimes a film is bad in uninteresting ways, so you are doubly cheated. Truly bad films are a special pleasure for me because they allow you to examine your limits in ways that the cozy ones don't. And when they relax in competence, sometimes you can fill the voids and create your own success outside the lines.

Even when things get the bleakest, you can fall back on wondering how you could fix the thing. What is the shortest path from this failure to a film that works. Usually in this game, there's the task of removing what offends and then exploiting the one, usually one device that could reward.

The reward here is the one that "Napoleon Dynamite" "Igby Goes Down" and a host of John Hughes movies exploited, the notion of a familiarity with unfamiliarity. Something deeper than different. Its the one thing that Marvel comics understood and they hammered at it from all sides. If they were a political party, they'd be in and dealing with human needs instead of finding war.

So the potential reward is uninteresting, as uninteresting as political dialog. 

Where does this thing go wrong? The answer is uninteresting in the extreme, I fear. In matters like this, you count on the filmmaker or writer to have a sense of place in the humor. Sometimes it doesn't have to actually be funny, but if that place is well founded and presented with confidence, then you go along for the ride.

In fact it may even be better that way: that's why people like Ed Wood so much. Corman. The thing knows what it is and lives. This is a collection of glancing hits. None of the arrows stick. No one found a groove.

There is one interesting scene. We know that our savior is a girl so the salvation will be through sex. And we also know that she is a performer so that the construction of the thing will have her "show" Howard how to perform in the play that is his little life.

So we have a sequence where she discovers a condom in his wallet. Then she teases him with her dancer's body and he responds. They commit to sex, at which point the story turns, the inner stage substituted for the outer.

If this film worked, if it had been presented with confidence even, that one scene could be on my list of the great ones. Its a great, deep idea, worthy of the guy who wrote "American Graffiti" and the best Indiana Jones movie.

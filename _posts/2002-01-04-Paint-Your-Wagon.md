Spoilers herein.

This is very strange. It clearly was the inspiration for the recent 'Bandits,' but the dating makes this seem like science fiction: Eastwood's hairdo, the now uncompelling beauty of Seberg, Eastwood's awkwardness... Marvin has a few good physical comedy routines, but Walston steals every scene he's in.

More science fiction: polygamy both ways; a purchased wife is a 'stake;' kidnapped whores spawn a boom; extreme piousness as the marker of 'civilization.' A tremendous (for the time) effect in a series of building collapses. That's on top of the basic strangeness of people punctuating life with demonstrations in song, as if they were preaching. (But preaching is the sole thing pilloried here.)

The first half has some rather clever, then expensive slow fade transitions, starting with the titles. And Josh Logan spends as much time on the dirt as a unifying 'ground' as his handlers would allow.

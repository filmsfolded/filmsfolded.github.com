Spoilers herein.

Kurosawa's genius was in envisioning a story in visual terms, then translating that through masterful framing, and direction of actors. Along the way, he became an absolute master of editing -- editing each day's shoot that night. And he invented a vocabulary of multiplanar storytelling with often three planes of action flattened by his telephoto lens.

Then, success crept in, and his studio forced him to make more and more samurai pictures with plots not conceived in his mind. These are still wonderfully photographed, but you can see that the narrative itself wasn't fertilized in his visual imagination. That integration of visual narrative and the various production skills was broken, most clearly with 'Red Beard,' and the realization led to collapse, a suicide attempt, and a long, long crawl back to 'Ran,' possibly the most narratively integrated film in existence.

Along the way, he went through a new apprenticeship and this film is one of the tests he endured. It has one of the Kurosawa master touches: it has an abstract, intelligent, sometimes beautiful camera. But it lacks nearly all of the other elements that add to the hypnotizing mastery of his earlier, integrated efforts:

--he had no control over the story, which is quite second-rate and ordinarily conceived (meaning it is literary like Tolstoy and not visual like Tarkovsky)

--he could not edit at night because of the cumbersomeness of the 70mm process and the insistence on using remote, Soviet processing labs

--he had to work in a language that is not only different, it is profoundly so: Japanese phrases have a staccato rhythm that builds with an emphasis on the end. This is something Kurosawa uses to project to the next scene, or cut within the scene. Russian is a matter of lingual brushes that peak in midphrase and tail off. Each phrase has its own arc, its own closure that one cannot use to sew continuity between utterances. (There is the whole matter of noh gestures as well, but the structure of phrase is more basic and leverageable.) 

--he was forced to live in an 'open' environment.

This last is the primary test of this film (which incidentally bears fruit in 'Ran'). Hitherto, all of his visual compositions were a matter of manipulating physical constraints to 'contain' the frame. He would use buildings to frame village scenes and valley tree and rock elements to frame wilderness (the best of which are 'Hidden Fortress'). 'High and Low' is an exercise in inside/outside constraints, but always constraints. Here he is faced with an openness, where the openness is the unescapable soul of the environment. 

How to frame and focus when all his framing and compositional tools are unavailable? You shoot from the inside out, rather than the outside in as is traditional in all Japanese art.

Lots of this film is unsure experiments in managing this new visual cosmology. The running along the bank of the rapids and the waking up in the emergency grass yurt were irresistably with the old eye for instance. But the lost wandering on the lake bed is an example of him struggling for a coherent frame. There is not a tree, nothing at all. So see how he uses nothing as a constraint, and he shifts that nothing of the open air to the surrounding grass sometimes when they frantically cut it. Framing with open space. See how he plays with this space constraining the fabric constraining the men in the opening of 'Ran.'

Its a painful journey, this film, not a joy, often tearful for us as we participate.

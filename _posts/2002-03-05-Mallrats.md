Spoilers herein.  Another show about a show as a poor substitute for the scaffolding of the Divine Comedy used for 'Clerks.'  What is interesting is the DVD commentary which tells us a lot about Ben Affleck. Some bad actors don't annoy me, but Ben and Matt really do. That's because of the damage they did to the mind behind the art in 'Good Will.'  Here, you get a feel for where Ben comes from, and Kevin bears some of the blame. The idea is: 'Hey! let's get a buncho friends together and make a movie. It will be about superficialities, but that's the point.' But Kevin knows who he is goofing on and it is all in good fun. Ben doesn't, and it isn't. Kevin is smarter than his subject, Ben very much dumber.  He convinced Smith and Mosier to help him out, so they produced 'Will,' leveraging their own goodwill. With 'Will' the vision was less tight than with a Smith-written bit so the studio was able to gloss it up.  But you can see Ben in his real persona here. As his career grows (as it surely will) this film will become more and more a goof on him than a goof on Jay. You can see the influence of Bob and Jay in Will's characters.

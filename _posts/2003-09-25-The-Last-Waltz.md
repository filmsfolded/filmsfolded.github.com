Spoilers herein

 Rock and Roll, despite its self-described rebellion, is about order. Blues is also about  order, slightly but emotionally and predictably outside of order. They are both like a bad  marriage -- charming at first but tedious in the long run.

 Country music and its incarnation in folk was then about storytelling. Some time around  '66 Bob and Paul and John (and Brian and some others) started writing music cinematically. Some of the Beatles songs come from directly movies: 'All you Need is  Love" is from South Pacific, for instance. But all of the later Beatles songs and Dylan  songs from this period (beginning with "Tambourine Man") started life as cinematic  visions, stories in pictures translated into lyrics and energy.

 For a good while there, cinematic music was a strong contender for our imagination in  the music marketplace, with The Band as the lead vehicle. That's in part because of the  mix of Garth Hudson and Levon Helm. Garth is all about discovered disorder. He calls it  jazz because something similar often happens there, but disorder in the popular media  is something else: Garth's vocabulary is all about lyrics with unexpected emphasis of the ordinary. It is blues outside the lines allowed by the tradition and jazz within street  signs. It is beat made pretty. His inspiration is John Ford's innovation: Ford took a dull,  bad cowboy actor and taught him how (in "Stagecoach") to utter his lines with an  unexpected cadence. Thus began a tradition of performance "jazz" in film acting which  Garth adapts and exploits.

 Helm is a storyteller, from a family of storytellers. The two, Helm and Hudson, together  have crafted a novel and lasting entry in the art of cinematic music: stories whose  rhythms in telling are different enough that they establish a sort of aural camera. The  other members of the band are talented enough, but act primarily as transferral agents  from other innovators and traditions rather than innovating themselves.

 Dylan was the primary experimenter in our age of language, mostly in sounds rather  than cadence, until he met The Band while recuperating from a near-death experience.  When he tied in with them, magic happened: stories, cadence, poetry, merged, all  cinematically rooted -- and it transformed us all. Every one of us of a certain age passed  through the portal of this music, following the progress through underground copies of  the basement tapes and nearly unreadable late generation xeroxes of stolen galleys of "Tarantula."

 (This tradition of cinematic music with disordered cadence has been abandoned by the  later Dylan, even in singing older songs. It is continued and extended in its pure form by  Joni and Van, and was picked up as goofy irony by The Police, Talking Heads and some  Genesis. But it is now all but dead and has been appropriated as soap opera by today's  so-called country music. This concert was the end and we all knew it, even then.  Compare the novel, odd phrasing of the recording of "Forever Young" to his earnest but flat phrasing here. Is it his conscious surrender, or something else?)

 As with music, so always with cinema: there was a similar battle in the world of film for  control over our imagination. The notion of character-informed rhythmic storytelling was  led by Scorsese (and Coppola). It is a deeply Italian tradition, as compared to more  layered and experimental narrative traditions. That's why Scorsese wanted to do this and  why he succeeds so admirably: it is cinematic music finally expressed in cinema, his  variety of cinema. It is his only successful story.

 Is this the best concert film? Yes, in fact it may be the only honest film of a concert  possible because the songs come to the film as the film comes to them. They probably  never will again.

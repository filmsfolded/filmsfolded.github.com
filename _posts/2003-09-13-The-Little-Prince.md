Spoilers herein.

Children's books are a literature like no other. In 'regular' books, you nominally have the  world of the reader, the writer/narrator and the characters. In the children's case, you  add the extra dimension that the reader is not the person whose imagination is targeted.

The 'Little Prince' follows the lead of 'Alice in Wonderland' in exploiting the  relationships among these four worlds: and it does so by creating a fifth within the story.  Its a sort of double story about a boy and a man who remembers himself as a boy: about  each layer drawing the other: about surveying the forces that build the world, the two  worlds.

I'm an 'Alice' guy myself and don't particularly like the 'Prince' book. It's too patronizing  and shallow for my tastes, but the FORM of the book is very sophisticated.

Now along come thugs from the musical theater tradition. In trying to turn a flower into a  gem they produce a turnip. That's because they completely misunderstand the necessary  narrative layering that makes the book work.

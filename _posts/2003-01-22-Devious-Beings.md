Spoilers herein.

These sorts of films appear rough, but in fact are pretty delicate in their construction. They are hard to pull off, with the mechanic of thuggish energetic randomness on the surface and a constructed order underneath (usually by a conspiring character). In keeping with this genre, Devious advertises itself as a cross between 'Go' and 'Snatch.'

'Snatch' solved the formula by focusing on the snappy energy of the confounding front-story. 'Go' (and 'Salton Sea') took the complementary route, focusing on the geometric perfection of the understory. This project fails to do either. As the supposedly rough and random front-story we have actors as dumb as their characters. As the supposedly clever understory, we have the most manipulated character as the manipulator, shades of 'Nine Queens.' But none of this is prepared in the story. Despite the fact that it is unclever, the writer doesn't play fair.

The only convincing element here is that the fat actor convincingly plays a fat character.

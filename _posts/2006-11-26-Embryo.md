Perhaps this affected a few folks when it was new. We accepted all sorts of hokey things then and at least this had name actors and relatively slick production. In cinematic terms, its unremarkable. The filmmaker had to resort to devices where the hero is "explaining" things to us in words, so in the film he speaks into a tape recorder.

The story is pretty cool though and probably could be good reading with a competent writer. A scientist develops a drug that can accelerate the development of a fetus. Before he knows it in a short time he has a sexy 21 year old. Two side effects: incredible intelligence (here stupidly related to memory) and some sort of drug addiction that if not satisfied would continue the accelerated aging.

As with Eliza Doolittle, our doctor falls in love with his innocent protégé, and (we find at the end) impregnates her. Meanwhile she believes that she needs the juice of a new baby to survive so destroys the fetus of the doctor's grandchild (and her mother). 

This leads to a chase at the end where the doctor tries to kill her as she becomes an old woman, but pregnant. As he goes for a final blow, she tells him it is his child. 30 years ago in a dark theater and lower expectations of pacing, this would have chilled. Its still a creepy idea.

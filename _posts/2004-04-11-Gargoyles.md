Spoilers herein.

Naturally you already know that this is basically 50's drivein fare; even the Goon rubber  suits are copied from 'Creature from the Black LaGoon.' Not much to add to that.

What's interesting here is the nearly thirty year old, chunky Jennifer Salt playing the  teenage daughter. She's from an actually intelligent family who created some important  films. Why oh why didn't any of it rub off?

Spoilers herein.

'Eat Drink Man Woman' works because the chief chef is wholly dedicated to living his life through his food. That food has purpose: it expresses his love for his daughters. He doesn't make food for the food, but for the consumers of the food. The food is a direct link between souls. Ang Lee directs his film the same way: he is dedicated to the art as a matter of pleasing us. It is a gift from him to us.

This film, 'Big Night,' is different. Not a matter of dedication but of obsession. Not a matter of pleasing us, but pleasing the chef and directors/actors. As with the food and film, we are taken on a fun ride as everything Scott and Tucci can do is done. The camera swoops as if dePalma wrote the recipe; pairs banter as if Mamet was writing; props are used as if Ridley were in charge. 

But nothing here is inspired, it is all by the recipe.

It is because of this obsession that I re-watched this. In the last two days, I've seen Shalhoub in 'Thirteen Ghosts' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There.' in all three of these cases, the filmmakers depended on his excess. But I think this case is different, because actors are in charge, and they appreciate this sort of obsession: just like we are supposed to admire Primo.

Spoilers herein.

Family dramas are a special problem in film. That's because the core of what we know and have come to expect was developed in the theater (and now on TeeVee). Family interactions are something invented by society -- usually film merely reinforces the major, theatrical form merely adding in the perspective of the day. Right now that is narcissistic pseudoirony ('Meet the Parents,' 'You Can Depend On Me') which is rather boring.

Lee is a serious student of cinema, and when he does something it is with the intent of advancing his ability to convey through images. That's why he chose the simple family drama, so that he could explore breaking the theatrical conventions. The theatrical way, for instance would have lots of talk, lots of emotional texture and some shouting. Think of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?' Think of any number of dying lover movies.

The problem is not simply one of being cinematic because one has to overcome such deepseated expectations of who carries what ball and when. This experiment could not have been possible without Kline, just as 'Sense' couldn't have been attempted without Thompson.

So we have as much of an imagebased little drama as possible. Watch this once with no sound to see how carefully it is constructed. Everything is so quiet and still. All the theatrical dynamics we know that are there are kept under the surface. The brilliance of the approach is that rather than fight those dynamics, he references them. So we know what the bicycle/shoplifting deal is all about without having it marched out as would normally be the case.

To my mind, Ms Ricci today is an uninteresting artist. But here, she is used effectively as the visual anchor for everything. In fact, one can almost tease out the narrative with her voice over 'It was the winter of...' This would be the case in normal dramas, like 'Virgin Suicides,' but thankfully is indirectly referenced here with her masked as a liar. Very clever.

His technique is to establish our world not in the family but in a recent past, one which is entirely defined by visual metaphors. This man knows what he is doing. My objection is that Lee tries for too little. What he does is done well, but I would rather he took bigger risks and transported me further and tinkered with my mind and soul and possibly damaged some actors and property. This is too great a talent to be gentle with.

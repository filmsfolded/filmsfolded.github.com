I saw this with "Lower Detphs," a good match in some ways. Like that film, this is profoundly cinematic. All the narrative is in the images. It isn't framed as perfectly as Renoir's work. In fact it lacks temporal economy, as if the filmmaker was so in love with his images that he wants you to take twice as long with them as you normally would. Not all of them deserve this.

But all the scenes with the daughter surely do. She is the subject: a beautiful young woman with an accidentally disfigured face. Her experiment surgeon father just happens (!) to be experimenting with face transplants. The story itself is too ordinary to mention.

What's remarkable is the way this woman's face is used. She usually is wearing a mask that looks eerily real. Then we see her "reconstructed" face, and then the mask again. First, the woman without the mask. She is an Audrey Hepburn type, actually to my mind, very much more graceful and poised. She must be a dancer, something you can see in her work with Orson earlier. Viewers at the time would have been familiar with her beauty and her off- screen scandal involving the murder of her husband's lover. She would have come to this, in other words, with one of the most famous and storied faces in the world.

She has possibly the loveliest neck I have seen an actress use as part of her character. Its often all we see of the real her other than her eyes.

And the mask! It is her face and fits so closely and naturally that when you first see it, you believe is must be just paint. But it does seem expressionless, at least in a given scene. Later, we can see the lips move. And if you look closely, you will see that different masks are used when the drama heightens. We've had masks in films recently. "Open your eyes" and "V," the former clearly inspired by this. The mix of realism and lack of emotion in the "skin" focuses attention on the eyes and neck, and the carriage of this woman. Its remarkable. She knew what she had, and so does the filmmaker, and we could go for hours with her like this, in those designer gowns.

Spoilers herein.

Yes, the production values stink... and the acting and the monsters. Yes the dialog is goofy. But it is not so far from more than half of the horror films I have seen.

The thing that really makes this seem bad is the dubbing. I imagine that the project was done so cheaply that the sound was unacceptable, a common syndrome. So the distributor did all the dubbing and added the background sounds and stock music.

But don't dismiss this too lightly. It is a combination of 'Rashomon' (aka 'In the Woods') and 'Blair Witch.'

Blair's genius is in having all the story outside the movie. Brilliant.

Rashomon's genius is in having the story in the movie shifting according to each participant. Both concern the creation of truth by a character in the action. Did anyone get the trick ending here? Wayne (the fire chief) is the inventor of the vision which comes on him in a drunken stupor. He is the second monster.

That bit about the hamsters eating each other was there for a reason. Possibly, that underlying intelligence was created by the second monster without the knowledge of the filmmaker.

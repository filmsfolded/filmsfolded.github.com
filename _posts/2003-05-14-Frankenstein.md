Spoilers herein.

Actors see the world of films in a much narrower way than educated viewers. Among them, Shakespearean actors - especially British-trained ones - have a particularly discernible perspective. The story doesn't really exist except as a scaffold from which to shine multiple beams of light on perplexities, and their metaperplexing behavior. Actors are the controllers of those illuminating beams, meant to inhabit some of the multiple, theatrical platforms the writer has provided. The basic impetus for such an actor is to inhabit as many of these roles as fully as possible.

Branagh has done so admirably for a few plays. But what to do about the fact that he is too young to play Prospero? Why adapt the Frankenstein story - which can accommodate a younger man - into a Tempest of course. What do you do with the talented actress you have fallen love with, and who would be a natural for Ophelia in your long-planned Hamlet, but who cannot be such because she's already been there with Zeffirelli? Why you make her your Miranda of course.

One can have an amazing experience with this project with those two insights. As with 'The Tempest,' this starts with a seatempest, actually using Shakespearean lines. Shipwrecked, the hapless crew discovers our man and his Caliban. In this version however, the Caliban is not cowed but has (literally) taken the girl's heart. The powers of creation and magic from the magician's 'strange books' (which are duly noted) have gone awry. This version ends in tragedy.

This is very clever idea, impossibly ambitious. We need the best actor in the world to be Caliban, but he has to be the type of actor that isn't intelligently self-aware (like Penn or Nicholson or Brando); instead we need someone who acts the way Caliban would if he were an actor, with full passion and commitment but shocking lack of sophistication. Robert Deniro of course.

More and more, one can see how Branagh plays the role of Prospero even in creating the film, and with equal tragedy - and for the same reason: the unleashing of grand forces beyond his control. He gets Roger Pratt as the cinematographer, the world's most architectural photographer. We last saw him do his stuff in the second Harry Potter film, and he has also done some remarkable architectural work for Gilliam. He's a tough customer.

Now design the laboratory: it is a very deliberate meld of the throne room of 'Camelot' and the lair of Eisenstein's 'Ivan the Terrible.'

And we're off! Watch how the order of the film disintegrates as the order of the world depicted does. Watch as Branagh the director fails to understand and control the monster of Deniro. Watch as the god of the environment (Pratt) conspires against the director just as fate toys with Victor. Coppola tried this very same tactic with 'Apacolypse:' a film about risk in disorder created by risk in disorder. Worked there but not here to judge from looking in from the outside.

But along the way, there are some remarkable moments. One in particular: the 30 seconds or so of realization on the proto-Elizabeth's face. The entire effort on his part and ours is worth it for that one glimpse into the magic of oblivion - more horrifying than almost any film except possibly the similar ending scene in the the next year's 'Safe.'

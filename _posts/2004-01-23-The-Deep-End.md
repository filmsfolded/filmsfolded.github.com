Spoilers herein.

I'm becoming interested in Tilda Swinton, now that I have seen her in several  experimental roles. She has a focus that charms. It is not the kind of acting that I value  most - what I look for is folded acting where several layers are simultaneously  presented: Brando, Sean Penn, PS Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Kate Winslet, Cate

Blanchette.

Tilda is of a different class, Nicholson, Streep... Those who project less by annotation  than projection. An ordinary actor works with just a few tricks and parts of their body.  Tilda's approach is to inhabit a smaller self inside and project onto the back of her face.  The concentration must be extraordinary - in some of her projects ('Orlando,' 'Ada')  she stares right at the camera and clearly right at us.

A noir film could only be made in a small period which is now long gone, so when one is  remade, it needs to have some distance - just the sort of thing Tilda can do. The  original was smack in the middle of noir notions: a grinding, capricious fate that bobbles  characters about. This one needed to have a different center, one where a character can  create her own fate to some extent.

Its a risk and even in the best case bears little reward. But it is interesting to see that the  people behind this project understood what Tilda could do, and supported her in doing  it.

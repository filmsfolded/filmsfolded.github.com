Spoilers herein.

You can read elsewhere about the tone: somewhere among 'Ghost World,' 'Tenenbaums,' 'Harold and Maude,' 'Terms of Endearment,' and 'American Beauty.' Read elsewhere also about the comic neoirony. And about the framing death.

What you'll get here is my notion of how the director asked the actors to focus their irony. Usually, the director has a vision to which he attunes everyone, then gives that cinematic expression. What this kid did, I think, is to reference each character in a cinematic actor. That way, his own lack of cinematic sculpting would be overcome by the presumed work we would do in making the connections. And that's what we do because irony is about reference and making films is all about reference to other films.

So we have Culkin doing Robert Downey Junior's version of Ferris Caulfield. We have Claire Danes doing something interesting here: Cate Blanchett is her own enveloped universe. Danes attempts to envelope her in doing a Cate Blanchett version of Ophelia. This film deliberately uses the 'shifted focus' to share the narrative with her.

What distinguishes this film from all those listed above is the wonderful use of language. This has real dialog. That snappy, metaphoric dialog comes from studiously unreal people, so is delicious. It is commented on with Claire's fake laugh in the first  visit to the ice cream parlor -- I'd class this as black screwball. That dialog is full of image, but not delivered to emphasize the punchlines. In a regular film, we expect them to set up every gag, emphasize it and tell us its time for a response. But they don't. That they fold this rich language into their everyday world makes that world ever so much richer. So when Anderson gives us a world of faces, Steers gives us aural imagination that the faces support.

I could not recognize Amanda Peet's reference (Hepburn does Holly Golightly?), but she has the best scene in the film: She preps for a lunch date with DH, shows up, tries an ingenue act and is dropped because she can't reproduce DH's fantasy. This is all done without a single word. It is the scene which drives the unraveling of lives we have come to watch. As the fulcrum of the film, they decided to do it with a 'white space' of no words. The whole project is about acting roles, both in form and in the story.

Goldblum incidentally acts with his posture. Very nice.

Elsewhere, there's a small moment with Cynthia Nixon as a former teacher with a crib in her bedsit to whom Igby is now delivering drugs. She does a lot with her few moments. Watch her. This is a special kind of acting.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

Spoilers herein.

Sometimes a movie is bad, a real stinker. But you can have great fun with it by watching how it annotates its own weaknesses. The movie is about a winning formula that because of command inflexibilities produces no reward. That describes this movie. It contains a story about an inept signalman who botches the message-sending machine. Same here.

There are some who celebrate Steve McQueen. He shows here that whatever he brought to the business was a matter of personality and not skill in the art. Comedy is hard. He doesn't have it, doesn't deserve to be an officer in this Navy.

Spoilers herein.

I love self-referential stuff, especially when it is self-aware self criticism. But that's because it is usually clever. It usually speaks to some interesting question. But this is sophomoric. Just because it knows and says it it is dumb is not enough.

This is anti auteur auteur; ironic non-irony; bad film about bad film; a simpleminded, superficial commentary on simpleminded superficiality. Melanie Griffith as an over the hill second rate actress. Ho Hum.

Anal sex with gerbils? Well, that could have been interesting. In fact, I waded into this John Waters experience knowing what to expect because I was curious about Alicia Witt. She has become an icon of sorts and so used as Libby in 'Vanilla Sky.' That's because of her roles in 'Dune' and 'Leibestraum,' the latter of which is the source for the Libby name.

I watched her in 'Urban Legend' and here. I don't think I will pursue it further. She was once something and now is not.

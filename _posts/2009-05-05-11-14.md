There are only a number of ways to be successfully cinematic, and this kid has discovered a rarely used one.

What we have here is a world with only a few humans, all of whom are tied to vehicles. No one is ever shown on screen, nor any car that is not a significant plot element. All of these people and cars are afforded the same level of importance. There is no story, no long form development at all. The story exists only as a means to weave these people together in a very tight and sometimes unexpectedly clever fabric. Each actor has a very narrow job, so they do well enough.

So far so good. What makes this movie special for me is the cinematic business -- how the cars give this energy. And it does have energy; it snaps. The size of the bricks is exactly right for this effect: the size of the physical chucks (the scenes and cuts), the size of the narrative elements and the size of the conceptual ones, all three weaving in the same manner as the cars.

Each fact ends up reinterpreted as a result.

I was thrilled. It is a precision hurdy gurdy, something simple done exceedingly well. It will be interesting to see what this fellow's intuition will give us in a real movie, with long form and scope.

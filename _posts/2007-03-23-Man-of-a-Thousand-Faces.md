A film legend played by an even bigger film legend. Two stories about shifting from a silent world to a speaking one. This is interesting.

Families: an honest son (himself a film celebrity, but of lower order). Two wives, one flawed. A grudge. This is not interesting, even in the slightest.

A walk through the confusion of silent filming. The most interesting of all.

The "point" of the movie is that this man of many faces created one for the family he wished, and another for the wife he blamed for not trying, even though he got her pregnant without revealing a significant genetic flaw. This is done poorly.

All in all, this barely rises to a 2.

Science fiction has a curse. To work in a movie, it has to be cinematic, which narrows the possibilities. So we usually get monsters, threats, explosions, Movies limit the best ideas just by forcing them into the form.

So it is something to celebrate when a clever science fiction movie appears, one that doesn't depend of radiated monsters, indeed monsters of any sort. Now this one does have some reference to malignity from space, but otherwise the "monsters" here are pretty amazing. Not pods or creatures but rocks.

The story arc is ordinary: small town scientists single handedly find the weakness and battle to save the earth.

Usually in these things, we'll have a movie in a movie in some way. Here it is a newspaperman. No cameras at all.

There's a nice joke. The geologist has been spewing a bunch of scientific jargon all jumbled up with no real sense. If you know even a bit about science, its frustrating as all getout. So the geologist takes a break from his pontificating to call a meteorologist to find out when the rains will stop. The weatherman goes on for a few minutes with an equal verbal mess, disgusting the geologist who demands that he just answer directly.

For the era, the effects are pretty effective. Its a good idea, and pulled off fairly well.

Oddly, there is drama in the end that is not well exploited. The final defense concerns blowing up a dam, having the water flow through some salt piles, reach the desired amount of salinity and then cover precisely the right area to stop the progress of the monoliths. The drama in the movie is our hero's decision to blow up the dam without the governor's permission.

The actual risk is that if the required salinity level wasn't reached, the water would work against humanity and I wouldn't be here to type this. It was a risky call for ad hoc calculations.

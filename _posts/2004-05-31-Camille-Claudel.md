Spoilers herein.

Like the life it depicts, this has flashes of brilliance but is overall a failure. On the plus side,  we have an appealing enough actress who has what it takes to convince her she would be  desirable to Rodin. But there is no conveyance of the realities and burdens of talent, no  glimpses into the mind of madness and creative genius.

There is a nice, somewhat sculptural framing, beginning with the 'stealing' clay from a  workmens' ditch (and hen going to incestual, erotic visual poetry. This is recalled near the  end with her similarly burying her work.

But in between is rather dull, predictable march through some events. What a great film this  could have been.

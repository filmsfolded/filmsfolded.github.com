Spoilers herein.

I wish I had seen this before "Twelve Monkeys." Except for "Fear and Loathing," Gilliam is  artless (but reflexive). This is much more clever in how its manner (single images) reflects  its story (how registration of images in the memory can fold time).

Its a master stroke in storytelling. Haunting, something close to radio. The characters  become internalized in our own imagination as if we were traveling in time for a visit.

This is one of the roots of the family tree of science fiction films, especially those derived  from Phil Dick stories. Good science fiction is about observation and who is the observer.  The cleverness in this project is that the 'viewer' invents most of the reality: the viewer  makes a story about a viewer who views himself.

Ted's evaluation: 4 of 4 -- every cineliterate person should experience this.

Spoilers herein.

Frears is one of the interesting ones, at least to judge from his best: 'High Fidelity.'

Making a film is a matter of finding an accessible, downhill pathway among conflicting forces, some of whom are necessarily demons. Frears makes good decisions generally, but perhaps a little too friendly to the audience. But in this case, he chose the wrong compromises: there's no ambiguity with the good guys, who happen to all be lovely.

What he slights is the potentially rich notion of selling yourself to become yourself. Too doggone bad, because that could have made this a great picture.

What he doesn't slight is the engineering of layered observing narrative. That's where you have your actors fill the space between the viewer as observer and the play by forming a chain from here to there.

In this strategy, the watched person is the focus. He is watched and similarly discovered by another character, here TauTou, who is something of an icon already for this technique. They are watched by others, in turn a hooker and a cremator, forming an evenly spaced chain of observation from us to Okwe.

That gives Frears the skeleton upon which to build the mood on which this project relies.

Jane Fonda used to be a major media personality, one who hobnobbed with major political leaders. She had talent because she was hungry for success. Now, after mental problems and losing another husband she rejoins the world of film and plays....

Well, she plays the same thing. The character she plays is in the Shirley McLain mold, and amazingly, she does a terrible job. It is almost too literally a case of art mimicking life.

The setup here is simple, three women, a white, a Latino and a black. The white (Fonda) is supposedly offended that her boy (a surgeon) is marrying an uneducated, non-professional, and incidentally a Latino. the third character is a black servant who comes dangerously close to the Mantan routine. She cluck-clucks wisely rather than rolls her eyes as if it were less racist.

Three women. Tepid script. No humor. But this time the fault is not with Lopez. She actually does a good job playing, well, playing something like she probably is in real life (when she tries): a plucky object.

Sometimes a movie just gets off on the wrong foot. Sometimes it is clear that the filmmaker is reaching beyond his grasp. 

Then everything that follows seems dead, even though in another context it might work well enough.

The problem here is that we have a minor talent interested in small, human things. So far, so good; that's what constitutes the army we rely upon to keep the art viable. But he believes he has scope of Tarkovsky and frames what he does in those terms, literally. In fact, his character is a photographer who wants to make films like Tarkvosky.

Tarkovksy's gift was the relocated the center of emotion. He moved the creation of the world from something that a camera sees to something a camera creates. This gives him to power to recreate it and explore false memory. It also begins a game with the viewer about how engaged they are in what is happening. When the eye moves closer to our mind, it has a strange, unsettling effect -- the threat of intimacy with the stuff of the world.

Ceylan understands none of this. He thinks that long, moody shots are the stuff of engagement. He believes that by showing distance in many shots (and all the beginning ones) he somehow captures human disconnection.

The result is disastrous, a skyscraper made of jello, a pronouncement of love made while drunk.

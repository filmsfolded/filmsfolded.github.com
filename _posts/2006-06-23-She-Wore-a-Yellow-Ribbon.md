I spend much of my imagination in film. I use it in my life, fabricating worlds and cosmologies, so I'm a prime target for manipulative elements in film. And possibly nothing can be more manipulative than a Ford film intended to define and milk the American hero.

But even though I'm a prime candidate (I even cry at Sandra Bullock movies), I see Ford and his puppet Wayne as clunky, thin, ineffective.

Yes, the scenery is grand, and I know that it was rare in those days. But jees, having a majestic rock spire as the central element in every single exterior shot? Every one, from cemetery speeches to preventing the war and saving the nation (to the huzzahs of the President)? So, I'm sorry. Every element of this is blunt cinematically. The lines are simply dumb and overly theatrical, alternating between an emotional prancing and cheap comedy. Yes, we have Ford's necessary barfight as an ode to honorable masculinity. Yes, we have the selfish, shallow pretty girl who by the end sees what life and honor are all about. And yes, we even have the soft, pretty intellectual boy who discovers that a real life, the only the real life is army life.

The acting is that sort of theatrical posturing that we don't tolerate any more. There isn't anything at all about this movie that recommends it as a movie.

Ah, but as a touchstone in the American psyche! Few people appreciate how films define the patriotic impulse. Ford and Wayne were every bit as responsible for Vietnam as McNamara. Indeed, a core symbol of support for the troops (conscripted kids, not professionals in those days) was the display of a yellow ribbon.

That's been inherited today. If you don't live in the US this will sound bizarre. Almost exactly half the cars on the road have magnets in the form of yellow ribbons. They denote allegiance less to any political selection than to the values this movie and others like it manufacture.

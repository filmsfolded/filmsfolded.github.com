Spoilers herein.

I collect self-referential films. This are films that -- in the simple case -- are about themselves. Here we have a soft porn movie about a soft porn movie. That by itself isn't so interesting. The overlay is that we have a mystery. A somewhat traditional mystery where the detective and suspects are introduced. The 'clue' is in an early scene. It all plays fair by the standards of detective fiction.

The redhead is the murderer, she who we see at the beginning with the detective! She is murdering her fellow cows because of their knowledge of her birth. Here's where the self reference gets interesting: she is in effect a child of the movie business, daughter of an actress and a producer, just as this film is such a child. She 'plays a role' in the murders by pretending to be her mother, a real actress, just as these puffedup mannikins pretend to be actresses. During the murders, she 'removes her face' (her tart makeup) to be her 'real self,' just as this film reveals its real self to us by murderously trampling through our minds.

Herzog is a miracle. Somehow he himself dives deep enough into wildness to bring it back to us. Every affair is a voyage on the fringes of madness. He uses Kinski to help us focus, but the thing starts with a doomed or perverted struggle to which he attaches extraordinary images with saturated engagement.

To those images he attaches deep, deep sound, both indigenous sounds and hypnotic voices. Within this fabric, we have 1000 wild Amazons and wild Kinski.

The transcendence of the thing depends on the transcendence of the original struggle. In his river projects, that vision is life-altering. Here it is stilted. Colonial madness he handles well, but here the scope is too broad; there's too much story for the thing to cut you deep.

The stolen mistress, sugar, skulls, angry women, crazy kings, a line of flags, 62 children, and before the whole thing falls apart, a choir of young non-slave girls. That near-last image is the hopeful part, and it sticks. But its apart from the dark voyage.

Watch "Hearts of Glass" first, I think.

This comment is based on watching three episodes from the third season.

You will want to color them by knowing that I do not own a TeeVee, am generally offput by the cinematic compromises TeeVee makes, and am discouraged by what people will accept in TeeVee shows as filler for their lives.

But I had some positive expectations from this having heard Larry David interviewed by Terry Gross. It sounded like a worthy experiment:

-- Lines discovered by the cast at the last moment

-- Significant self-reference in the setup: a comedian playing a comedian's life

-- Extreme self-mocking

-- All the primary jokes have at least two layers. For instance if there was a joke about racial boundaries, it would be accompanied by a joke about bald brotherhood.

I have to admit that before I watched the show, I admired it. A month after the experience, I recall the idea fondly. But actually watching the thing... I hated it. It was clumsy, not in a homemade and accessible human Ernie Kovaks way, but just awkward. It was too abstract in presentation for the material it was using. The actors seemed external to their own stories, all of them. You can easily imagine them snickering in the sidelines but you never have access to this -- which would have helped.

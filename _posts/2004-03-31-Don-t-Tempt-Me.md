Spoilers herein.

I give Spanish films (minus Bunuel) lots of extra points; I just like the way they generally  handle fantasy and how they entangle it with notions of observer-created reality. So this  modest effort gets raised to tolerable. 

But it does have three interesting actresses. I finally can say I've seen Ms Penelope do real  acting. Here, she is a sexy Spanish actress playing a (presumably Italian-American)  gangster in the body of an English angel from Hell posing as a lost cousin who takes a  role as a manager of cashiers who then puts on a final disguise to rob the place. This last  frames the picture and is the root of the identity chain. Cruz reflects some presence at  every level. 

And Abril and Ardant, though not heaviweights, are particularly interesting in how they  sculpt poise.

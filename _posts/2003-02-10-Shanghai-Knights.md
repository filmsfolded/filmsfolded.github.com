Spoilers herein.

I was really surprised by how rich this film was as a sheer cinematic adventure. It may well be one of the best films you'll see all year, and might be remembered as Chan's 'City Lights.'

That's no thanks to the buddy comedy and the story. And the fight scenes pale compared to hundreds better, it seems hundreds even by Chan. But this is pretty mature and coherent mastery.

Most movies focus on people, and use the environment more or less as moodsetting filler for the frame. Sometimes, the camera has a particularly acute understanding of a place. Or less often, as in the second 'Harry Potter' the eye is purely architecture. I love it when that happens, but even in that case, the characters and the environment are separate. Not so here.

Here, they let the movie flow as a collaboration between Chan and primary cinematographer Biddle (and his art direction crew). Biddle introduces us to a space with lots of elements, then he manages the 'ubiquitous eye' to help us see Chan USE that environment, choreographically merging with it.

Plus the self-referential touches that I like: there is specific mention of that ubiquitous eye in the story. In fact, there are lots of self-referential bits: the two as ersatz Butch and Sundance but written by Butch, in fact Butch and Sundance as ersatz Beatles who are also referenced here. There's stuff about wax characters and moviemaking and writing again. There's a terrific 'Singing in the Rain' number, and two homages to Charlie Chaplin, one as they are off to Hollywood.

This isn't all that funny, nor exciting. But it was rewarding for this man with cinematic tastes.

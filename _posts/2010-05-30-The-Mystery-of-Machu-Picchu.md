This suffers from TeeVee-itis, the pandering to an audience by creating needless drama. In this case, you take the puzzles and investigations and color them as luridly as you can without outright lying. This happens on the Murdock news channels, and I believe this is related. So you will have to put up with the fake drama, the manufactured cliffhangers.

But this surely is worth it. In terms of the animations describing the architecture and the construction, I cannot imagine it being done better.

The Incas were more spatial and less object-focused than the Maya, and the surroundings more viscerally communicative.

Of particular interest are careful animations that show how the amazing, complex fitting of the irregularly-faceted stones was accomplished. This is another case where the film is better in many respects than any static book could be. The spatial iconography may be interesting to spatial cinematographers, though the makers of this film did not exploit that.

Spoilers herein.

Once again we have a film about writing. That's the first recourse for writers, and since Devito is a film writer, the book derives from a Hitchcock film. The mix is rather clever, but the humor is ordinary. What's different here is the mix. As with many book-films, the story on the screen becomes the story in the book, but here we have two books of the same events. One book is serious, the other -- Devito's -- simply comic. The serious book matches up with the Hitchcock film.

This film is Devito's book. A simple popup -- how better to describe the humor of Crystal and Ramsey -- with a happy ending.

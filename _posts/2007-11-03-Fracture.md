Its amazing how you can dress something up. This is an attractive package, for sure. The framing and lighting, the set design and some props -- which I will mention in a moment -- make this tolerable. Its main matter is an ordinary form: two battling "minds" each trying to outwit the other: each betting something essential. They're played by two ineffective actors: a young man who just doesn't have the stuff and an older one who absolutely does, but who is too lazy to use it.

The incidental device that's used is of complex machines that work by large, clear marbles following gravity. Swirling and interacting by inevitably pulled down by gravity. Its used too much, because of the thinness of everything else. But its a great metaphor. I think I would rather have watched an hour of that, especially if surrounded by the house in which most of them are placed. The designers clearly designed the house to match the machines.

The idea here is that fate has the shape of justice. Well, a mundane idea, but in these machines a clever embodiment.

Spoilers herein.

What a great idea: a combination of magical war and detection! But there isn't any supernatural warfare, just regular old levitation, pushing around and stuff. The crucial magical showdown in the beginning relies on guess what -- guns! Then the bad guy is 'bound' with iron fixtures bolted to his face, despite the fact that no magical tradition supposes magic comes from the face.

Real evil, real magic would be quite a different thing. Don't any of these guys study Crowley -- especially with so many scientologists in Hollywood? And even worse, there is no use, none whatsoever of intellect driving will. What a waste of a good idea. What vapid imagery.

Some of these Holmes films are rather interesting. This one is not. 

It is adapted from an actual Conan Doyle story, not a good one. I recall two later versions that were better, one which turned the plaster busts into music boxes.

What's interesting about this are three things. The first is that this Watson gets a huge amount of screen time to be funny in his bumbling way.

The second is that to spice up the dreary thing, a monster is introduced. Its straight out of the Universal Studios pattern of Frankenstein, heavily padded body, lumbering walk, facial prosthetics, stunted brain. This character and his amoral brutality is only mentioned until the end where we finally see him, first as a shadow, then in shadow, then full on in terror. He's a marvelous invention but wholly out of place in a Holmes.

And then there's the third notable thing. That end. Usually a Holmes story ends with Holmes not only successful, but successful on his own terms. He doesn't cheat, he uses his mind. The world is not emotional but logical, it is revealed. Always. But not here. He is confronted by two villains. He defeats one by lying. Holmes lying? Yes, friends, it is true. No guile, no intelligence, no supergenius, just a simple, uncreative lie. And the other villain, the one that is a real challenge?

Remember that Indiana Jones movie where Indy is paired against a giant with a deadly sword. The joke is Indy just shoots him. The joke is because we expect something true to character, something dynamic and brutal and honorably victorious. That joke was the best part of the movie because it stood outside the genre. It literally did: that day Ford was too tired and sick to do the fight that was arranged. So he became an actor commenting on the character. It worked there.

Here, it is just a blot. A huge blot on Holmes. By now, Holmes' usefulness to the war effort was even worn out.

Avoid this.

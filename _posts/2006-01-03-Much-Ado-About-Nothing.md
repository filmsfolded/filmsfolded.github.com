Societies exist in large part so that ordinary folks like me can sponsor warriors to go and do marvelous things on our behalf. In this process, we pick and choose our heroes. We trust in them and sometimes jeer when they disappoint.

Branaugh is one I follow, because I think the world needs a talented Shakespearean actor who plainly wants to take that training into film-making. We've never had such a thing, though from time to time actors try to direct a Shakespeare play.

The thing about Branaugh is how bright he is, how quickly he learns how to adapt things to exploit what cinema has to offer.

But this is an early project in his journey. I liked it a lot when I saw it 12 years ago. It at least captured the play reliably. It took some chances with Keaton that I thought were interesting. But in effect it is a filmed play except for the management of horses at the beginning and the "hey nonny" dance at the end.

If for some reason you need a filmed version of this play, I suppose this is the one. But if you are interested in how film can capture the power of Shakespeare, I think you'll need to look at Branaugh's later attempts.

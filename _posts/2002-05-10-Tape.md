Spoilers herein.

Here's a strange combination: a filmed play, and a self-referential video. Each works well enough in its own way, but it completely eludes me what the two have to do with each other. Or even if they touch. It is as if the director wanted to do something serious cheaply. The serious part is his approach to the material. The cheap part is the material.

'Blair Witch 2' explored this area with more cleverness I think. (I'm not kidding!)

So far, I know only one other Linklater project: 'Dazed and Confused' which seems like a poor copy of prior material. Looks to me that he isn't worth following. But Ethan Hawke might be. What impresses me is how an actor fills the space the director doesn't know about. His 'Hamlet' was quite intelligent. He actually understood the play, unlike Mel Gibson. Here, he tries to be the bridge between the two halves I mentioned by playing a character who is playing a character that is dimly resolved, rather as if he had defined himself through tape.

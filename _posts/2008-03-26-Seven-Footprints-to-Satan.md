This starts with a clumsy introduction where we are introduced to our couple and discover that our hero is desperate for adventure.

Then we are moved into the large center section which is two films superimposed. One is a haunted house deal, the house to which he and girlfriend are kidnapped. Its a prototype for much that followed: all sorts of assorted beasts and persons according to what makeup could then do. Sliding panels -- all sorts of seriously elaborate stage effects of coming and going, about half of which are comedic.

It seems that this same crowd is in white slaving, and hosts orgies for wealthy acolytes of Satan. This part of the film is set in a huge room with surfaces and stairs, including one set leading to Satan that constitutes a sort of high tech test for our hero. (He passes.)

There's no nudity in this but the women are there for sex as objects for the rich and evilly powerful. The girlfriend is next, presumably to be used by the whole crowd. There's no mistaking that some of this notion and staging was used by Kubrick, but more important was the notion of a dream, a false play based on available shared exploitation.

Then finally we have the end where it is all revealed to have been an elaborate show. An amazingly expensive show, put on so that our hero could have some adventure in his life. Sort of underscores the life as a movie business, and the actress as whore, huh?

Its actually pretty imaginative. I'm not indicating the things normally celebrated. Its the idea of the thing, the show within the show that strikes me as novel.

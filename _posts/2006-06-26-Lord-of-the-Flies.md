This is yet another of those films that like its literary source started life honestly as art and then became a staple in industrialized education. Another book with the type of "message" earnest teachers can extract and teach, "explaining:" life. Another thin process that fools young minds into pretending they understand. But set all that aside; it is a life this film was shuttled into apart from its original intent.

And that intent is noble for sure. Brook was a stage director. His intent is not to moralize or tell a story. Like most stage dramatists, he doesn't mind those when they suit his purposes. But his main mission is to be affecting, to make an impression. And there's no compromise on that, constrained only by the sensibilities of British audiences of the time.

So we have episodes only. And because these are inexperienced actors the episodes are shaped by three elements: innocent faces, some fairly effective camera blocking, and one or two dramatic effects that have little to do with the source material. An example of the latter is the much quoted approach of a gang of robed boys across the beach to chants.

If this has any magic at all, it is in the stagecraft, and that's what makes it somewhat interesting.

Golding's original target was in the Austin tradition, to take a critical stance at society by merely describing it crisply. The message, a real one, is about the use of abstraction in understanding how we use abstraction to aggregate civilly. Austen-type introspectives, Golding and Brook all do this in different ways so the joy in this project is in seeing how they overlay.

Pay attention to the way we are implied. Everything that is there is obviously arranged so that our eye can catch all the important elements. Its along the same lines of narrative purification as the book but visual: the boys clump just so, not because of any social or physical law, but because our eyemind needs it so to see.

My mind gets offended at all this cleanliness, all this order intended to explain disorder. Part of the offense is the way things have changed in the world of drama: today we demand ever more simplicity and clarity, even more than Golding and Orwell and probably in part because we are taught them in school.

And we also demand it with less subtlety, at least outside the art-house.

Spoilers herein.

I'm looking at a lot of vampire movies these days. I'm discovering an amazing number of the better ones feature redheads.

One has to trudge through junk by hacks like Carpenter, but we do have some high spots. I like Tony Scott's approach to film: lots of flash, lush sets, energetic camera, lack of concern for character depth. This is his first real film and he shows real passion; it as if he were possessed by the blood himself. I am not a fan of either Sarandon, Deneuve or Bowie and think their handling here -- as props -- is about right. None of them understand how to place themselves in several perspectives at once.

The thing I like about this, despite all its immaturity, and the annoying directness of the actors is the direct relationship among the vampirism, the lust, the sex, and the lush eye.

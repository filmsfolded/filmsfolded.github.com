Spoilers herein.

I maintain that actors and filmmakers are often at odds. They simply have different concerns. The actor is usually interested in the immediacy of the moment, in pumping life into the project. The director is interested in moving that life with purpose using mechanisms outside the real of the actor: the eye, the flow, the memory. Usually, when you put an actor in charge, all you get is energy spurting all over the place; no form, no way into your soul; no life-altering opportunity, no art.

A few of the good actors have crossed that line. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins have impressed me in both roles. Brando and Depp did some really quirky, risky stuff as directors. But Deniro and Redford are worse than bad, they take away from the film life, they cheapen the masters by copying without understanding, they dull our imagination.

This film has lots of enveloping music; lots of cloying narrativeover -- both tricks of a poor director. It is excessively simple, and simply presented. Oddly, the only actor who transcends the limits of the gangster film is Pesci in the last few seconds with a pause.

The episodes do not connect. They begin and end as if the writer wanted to close the thought by the end of his writing day,

Deniro isn't stupid; he knows he messed up. You won't see him direct again.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Its petty to dump on the simplicity of this. After all, we readily accept equally offensive manipulations in modern movies. And this one at least has high production values overall compared contemporary films. Its just a matter of style. What we considered values back then simply don't resonate today except as a yearned for ideal in some sectors. (I refer to when the film was made, not the period in which it is set.)

So a comment on this film is essentially a comment on the values therein and how artfully they are conveyed. They are conveyed pretty well, I'd say, excepting for Peck. This was before he decided to simply be one character because his range is poor. Here he tries an accent and a being so foreign to him and unrealistic, he can't make it. Later, with "Mockingbird," he solved that problem, but here he's high school. Its so distracting that -- knowing his later history, and the irrelevance of the kid -- one could easily thing that the yearling is Peck.

There's an artificiality to the story that rankles. Would a couple in stress, who are near starvation, who have lost at least four children, some presumably from malnutrition... who are desperate. Would they allow a pet to repeatedly threaten their lives? This is a man in the story who is facing almost certain death if he goes to retrieve stolen pigs, but must. Its not a matter of honor, but of survival. If he is even slightly wounded, his family dies.

The real actor here is Jane Wyman. Wow she does a good job, except for the fantastic scenes of manual labor, which seem fake all around.

Essentially no one in the US is starving today, so this doesn't register. Its original audience would have known what it means, so the tale would have worked, even with the clumsy bits about earnest fathering spread on top.

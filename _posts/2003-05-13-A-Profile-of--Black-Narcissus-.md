I always indulge in the DVD extras, regardless of the project. Usually, they unsatisfy: the tone being either too trivial for the effort or thuggishly interpretive. "Black Narcissus" is blessedly uncomplicated -- its single reason for existence is the images -- so a film about it can be more comfortable.

After all, if you are talking about images it is natural to do it in a visual way. The producers of this small gem understood that and had fun with it. And lots of different kinds of fun. You will too.

The book is a strange construction. Its all about yearning in impossible circumstances. Rochester and Jane, with barrier after barrier faced.

To set things up, there's a long introduction to Jane's character. With modern methods, this bit would probably be unnecessary. Bronte gets away with it by adding in some small side stories and holding the promise of something meaty to come. Its an interesting problem, considering how to wrestle this unwieldy structure into a film that works for a modern viewer. Usually, a filmmaker is constrained by such legacies; he or she has to put every event, every word or enthusiasts of the story who believe themselves to be enthusiasts of the book complain.

Zefferelli might be the most interesting adapter because he actually thinks about films and has made some amazing ones both successes and amazing failures. What we have here is some balance. Lots of stuff is jettisoned. Its hard to see (with one exception) what should have been tossed and kept in a different balance. Zefferelli believes that the place has drama, that establishing and dramatizing the place first will provide situational context for the relatively small people that rattle around in it. Its an interesting world, that, and one that rewards because Zefferelli is at root an optimist. So the sets and particularly the exteriors he shows are glorious, even here where he often uses muted colors.

You might even like this if you come at the world that way. Its as if the world is so obviously and visually full of structured and deliberate promise that in time it must suffuse even the most vexing structural problem between humans. Its why Zefferelli (a gay agnostic) can make a compelling Jesus movie.

But for me there is only one value in this Bronte, and that's in the cutting dialogue between the two almost-lovers. Each superintelligent, each deliberating, and emoting words before the thought -- the strategy is complete and thus revealing their inner selves more deeply than if they had encountered a lesser soul.

That dialogue is all cut here, a victim of embodying the space.

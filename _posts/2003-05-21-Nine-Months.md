Spoilers herein.

I believe there are three strong film actresses today that can do 'folded' acting: acting which conveys both the character and some annotation on the character. Moore is one of them. I first realized this in her 'Vanya.' And so did many in the industry, with the result that the following year she was in many films. Some were a real challenge, and it seems that she accepted the others with the understanding that they would be simple walks. This is a walk.

It is by the successful Columbus, who has made few films but all of them are based on situations driving characters. And those situations always involve kids. Until recently, Columbus had no intelligent or even interesting element of any kind in his projects. The 'Chamber of Secrets' was so financially important, he was forced to accommodate an architectural eye and cinematographer.

Why do I mention this? Because an actress of Moore's caliber needs something to hook into, and the nature of the project was to avoid such things at all cost. What to do?

Watch. Julianne acts as Susan Sarandon acting the part. Watch how she eliminates all acting with her body at all (except for the general portrayal of the pregnant posture). Watch how she acts almost exclusively with the sides of her mouth and her eyebrows. Watch as she adopts an accommodating but distant sexiness. Watch as the shape of her face is changed by clever hairstyling. All of this to emulate Susan, and in particular Susan's Louise as if she were doing 'Blue Velvet' but for the other side.

Stay with me a minute. 'Blue Velvet' took the intelligent acting community by storm. It was a film where the 'characters' were two film genres, one of them the happy vehicle that Columbus does. The characters move through these two worlds, so that their context shifts and is never secure. Actors like Moore study this stuff. See how she shaped her movements of the dancing teacher around Rosselini's child dancing teacher of the previous year in 'Fearless' which dealt with the same material?

What she's doing is a little bit of subversion: Louise against the machine.

Artists like this are always doing something, even when they are at rest - even when the vehicle is as trivial as 'Smoochy.'

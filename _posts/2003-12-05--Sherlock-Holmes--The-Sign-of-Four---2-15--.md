Spoilers herein.

All films are either detective stories or they aren't. Better said: either a film's narrative is  designed to include the viewer as a part of itself or it is old-style, detached.

This most frequently happens in film, but it was invented in literature right here. Exactly  right here. This is Conan Doyle's second Holmes story. He was still feeling his way  around how exotic he needed to be, and how much of what is now called 'action' was  required.

But the basic framework is here. This is the first story that began as a game between  writer and reader to invent a world that made sense.

Unfortunately, this adaptation de-emphasizes all that and falls back on the TeeVee  model: all characters, and sets, what I call faces and spaces.

But it does have Jenny Seagrove, possibly one of the finest film faces ever. All she is  asked to do here is sit with poise, but just that is worth watching while the director  bumps around with the rest.

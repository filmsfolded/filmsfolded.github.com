There's no doubt that the state of genre is in flux. 

I don't mean that the definitions are evolving. I mean that the very nature of genre is changing. There used to be "simple" films that followed identifiable formulas, each formula pretty discrete. Each formula depended on the effectiveness of some straightforward market force. Stories do depend on market conventions when they are presented as a manufactured item.

All the purveyors needed to do was understand their niche and hit the target. We still have movies that are simple, take themselves seriously and which fall in those niches. But they work less because the genre is strong, than because there is a yearning for simple things. Romance is the area most obviously hit. But what used to be called "horror" is perhaps the most interesting.

I think it is because the audience is so young. They are clever and impatient. They need some sort of complexity mixed in with the adrenaline. One way to add complexity is by narrative folds. It has the usual effect: having an on screen audience, a watcher we watch, puts us in the story. This is unique to film and has all but become necessary these days. It is just a matter of how it is introduced and managed.

I have maintained for some time that we are shifting our notion of genre from the things the movies "are about," to metagenres I guess we could call them about how the story is being told and how the audience is folded in.

If you have not seen this, it is in the "Saw" tradition. You have your noir foundation: ordinary person caught up in forces for no reason other than the needs of an audience. The audience is on-screen and has supernatural control over the world of the watched, as if the watcher had written a script. The victim is tortured in cinematically extreme ways with the intent of capturing the moviegoers mind and equating it with the on screen watcher.

Devices are used: cameras are essential. Scripts in the form of literal books and storyboards appear. It is no accident that the prototype's name, "Saw," references sight.

The success of these things seems to depend on the balance of identifying the viewer with the torturer, but not too closely and at the end allowing the viewers to purge their own guilt by punishing the by now clear villain.

Here, the victim is a pretty model and the torture explicitly involves sexual betrayal. I have no doubt that this was designed to pitch to girls who know something about this. The victimized woman turns the tables (literally, as in all things here) at the end, Sigourney Weaver-like.

Once you start the imposition of layers, it is hard to stop the viewer for adding his own. I enjoyed this not because I watched the torture of the on screen victim, but because I watched the identical torture of the intended viewer, and the negotiation underway between her and the maker of this sort of thing, negotiating what happens next.

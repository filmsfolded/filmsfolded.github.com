You know, if something makes you laugh as intended it succeeds. It is a great thing, especially if it avoids making you feel dirty afterwards.

The basic story is only a device: wimpy guy pretends to be gay to save his job. This makes him fascinating to others including his estranged son.

The framework provides opportunity for jokes and endearments -- even a kitten. Even, my gosh, the visiting Japanese delegation bit. It is pleasant enough. But woven around that framework is a metastory about the wonder of the power of story. 

Here we have a complete loser, not merely ignored but belittled. A tiny story fragment is planted and around it grows all sorts of power fed by the situations brought by the people surrounding him. He is baffled, but like the rest of us has to go along. When he finally gets back to truth, he gets extra points because of the THAT story.

Dancing around in the background is the ever trustworthy Depardieu who has his own story- trick played on him.

This is delicate and deep, worthy of laughing at, a tiny story fragment planted in us around which we will build with what we bring.

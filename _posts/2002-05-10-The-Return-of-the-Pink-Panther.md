Spoilers herein.

How dreadful this is. Dreadful writing. Dreadful acting and production values. Even racist comments. The only reason one might watch this is because it has Peter Sellers in it. His comic awareness greatly exceeds that of the director. And although most jokes are repeated, often many times, he is joy to watch. 

His timing is perfect, and that is because he invented large parts of the film comedy vocabulary -- that part where the actor is performing the joke but is not wholly in it, yet also not part of the community of viewers.

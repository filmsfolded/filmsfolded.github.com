Spoilers herein.

This could have been a good movie. I'm particularly sensitive to the cinematic power of sexual exploitation -- after all, that's pretty close to much of the cinematic experience. And child molesting adds great power to the experience.

Also, I like Manga's sometimes honest approach to sexuality. Yes, its mostly prurient but its probably better to have sexual exploitation than the often humorous current repression. And anime sometimes goes where film has never gone before (graphic layout metaphors and object boundaries).

This film has all that, and still sucks. It has no soul, no graphic identity, no intrinsic pathos. Are we supposed to simply feel abused?

(it is a small thing compared to the general complaint about artlessness. But it completely destroys the child molestation bit to draw such huge breasts.)

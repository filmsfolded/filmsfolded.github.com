Spoilers herein.

Some minor chances taken here. It's a new fashion to make actors' pictures. Altman's been doing it for some time, but now we have guys like Anderson and Grey who bank everything on commitment. And these are committed actors -- they obviously are working hard, and it shows. It may work better in a theatrical setting, but this stuff only connects when you engage the viewer visually. (Or in some other metaphysical wrapper.)

And that's where this falls down. It's not the script as you would think, because in films like this, the story is the merest excuse for powerful images of some kind. You can flash like PT. You can build a wrapped environment for the actors to populate like Ridley. You can play games with the narrative like Kubric. But you've got to do something with that character called the eye other than rehash Godfather lighting.

Interesting to see what this guy does next.

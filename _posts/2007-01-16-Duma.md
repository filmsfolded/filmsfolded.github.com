Sometimes you just have to watch a bad movie to get a good movie experience.

The bad movie piece of this should be obvious: its values are those of TeeVee afterschool "entertainment," that product that we think is suitable for kids: moralistic, simple and touching on how a child should value its parent.

The speech at the end is particularly offensive; "I showed him the way home, but he showed me the same thing...." It was clearly written by someone otherwise not involved in the project and even sounds like another child's voice. And along the way in the movie we have to suffer all sorts of clich√©d situations, including one improbable escape after another. Par for the course.

But I'll ask you to sit through it because the fellow putting things on the shelf is Carroll Ballard. Filmmakers with open reach and cinematic skills are pretty rare. Since a life in film is a matter of trust in people, artists, I'll recommend Ballard to you.

He's always gets wrapped in syrupy junk, more recently now. He made "Wind," which really was a gas visually, elements of which have been copied in "big" movies. He copies a sequence from that here where a motorcycle is rigged with a sail to blow across the desert. Even now, there are elements that are fresh, even with the actors we have to work with.

He also made "Fly Away Home" which will be forgotten as a real advance in introducing three dimensional sweep to the camera vocabulary. We don't notice it now because animated films adopted and extended the idea so quickly. But in "Fly" it was done with a real kid, a real lightweight plane and real geese.

I have no idea how he gets these animals to do what he wants, but I assume it is difficult. The cat here has an engaging face which he exploits, but even though the sponsors probably wanted more humanization of the animal -- like in the execrable "March of the Penguins," he never allows the camera to cross that line.

Yes, you have to put up with a fake sentimentality, something that has come to stand for religion even. But the vision here is worth the annoyance. I wish this were cast more in the clothing of "Walkabout," something with grander aspirations.

Spoilers herein.

What is it about films set in Australia that allows even good filmmakers to think that they can  get away with tripe? Here we have at root the familiar story, usually of a wily pet who evades  huge odds, great distance and evil captors to return home. In this case we get some pleasant  enough children, a slight brush of mysticism in the air and wrapped in a morality play about  blind racism.

What an interesting film this could have been. Even the juvenile 'Walkabout' was better./

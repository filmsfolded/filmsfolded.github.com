Some movies are conceived as Valentine cards, sweet stories with clear morals set in a world designed to reward purity of heart.

Usually these are revolting. In this case that is mitigated by two factors.

One. If you are a western viewer, Buddhist notions of integrity are exotic enough to engage by themselves. To judge from the critical acclaim from critics in the west, that's true and I found it true myself, even though I know something about it.

But what I would like to recommend to you is not that you accept this at face value. Its as mawkishly sentimental as any Robert Redford bit. And you can't quite take it as a film made in the Buddhist manner. It isn't at all, not even close.

But the manner in which it IS made is wonderful. Its spatial cinema, that rare thing that I comment on from time to time. This has a wonderful setting absolutely wonderful. The entire film is in a temple that floats in a placid lake, sometimes moving. The surrounds are lovely mountains, but that by itself is not enough.

And its not just that the place and space is photographed in a rich, lovely manner. Its how the camera seats itself in the temple, so that even when you are in the forest nearby the cliffs and trees form temple walls. Its all about the temple, not the two men portrayed (and circularly merged into one man).

Watch how the camera establishes itself first on one of the architectural features as an edge or frame, then moves to an individual. Watch how the filmmaker moves your familiarity with the space into a central feature of the story towards the end. As it happens, the "script" of the story is written on the stage of the space (in ink dipped in a cat's tail), and then carved with a knife, then again painted and finally aged into the place itself. Its a masterful cinematic effect. Just masterful and trumps the moral and all else.

Watch it for that. It ain't Buddist, but it is transcendent. The parts of the space weigh on you like the stones attached on the outside at the beginning and the inside at the end.

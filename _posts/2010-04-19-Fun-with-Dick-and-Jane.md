Sometimes a movie starts with one idea and goes nowhere other trying to exploit it several ways.

Jane Fonda was the rare thing: a so-called sex kitten ing√©nue turned serious actress, additionally capable of comedy. 

Here, they build a comedy around her sexual allure. Every gag depends on it. They all fall pretty flat these days because the sexual banter seems tame, and the memory of her sexual intensity has been lost. But should you take the time to watch this, there is a signature scene that shook the world of Hollywood filmdom. Tame today but a big deal in its time.

Jane (the character has this name, and he husband is the dick) comes home with a great, exciting idea. It is sexually arousing we see. She wants to tell her husband and does so while taking a pee, starting the story before and going on well after repantying and flushing. It is a strange association that Americans (and Brits) have mixing toilet privacies with sexual openness, but there it is, used for effect, around which a whole movie of seduction is based.

She is alluring, but we now know she was drugged and unhappy.

I usually fall all over myself for films with this structure. Its such a cool idea to enter a dream world, or a haunted one. The folds are shuffled so we have the familiar unreliable narrator. And we have the device of the building. Its so, so very effective to use a set of rooms for the mind, at least it has been elsewhere.

And so cinematic (but unoriginal) to have rape be violent and dementing.

So whoever conceived this thing knew what he was doing. And it could have worked. In fact it should have and I'm really unhappy that it didn't. The actors do seem up to it. There seems to be no fear about showing disturbing violence, but amazing avoidance of anything prurient. Why? The entry, the containment.. The obsession with being within at any cost... his profession as an architect creating spaces that contain... The girls involved next door, the ones that talk about plumbing...

So many parts, enough to make a rocket. And so much fear on the part of the filmmaker. Think what Cronenberg would have done with this notion. What he has.

Spoilers herein.

Projects like this do not derive from their source as much as reference them. Therefore,  you really have to know the source in order to appreciate what has been done. A fast  food idea (one which actually spawned a trillion dollar industry) instead of a monarchy? A  grease burn for a bloody hand? An accidental death (after ineptly planning murder) in  place of a careful plot? It all depends on what you see in the source.

I don't consider 'MacBeth' one of Shakespeare's better tragedies. The man had a  particular ax to grind: a rude Scot had just become king, one with an unnatural fear of  the supernatural and a non-northern Catholic notion of fate. The play works at several  simultaneous levels, most barely subliminal.

Yes, the trailer trash thing works. And the fast food thing works, at least for me. And they  can have their tone which mocks the original; this _is_ the age of irony after all and it  makes sense to side with the trash.

But the dissonance is in the handling of the witches. MacBeth's witches were real, deeply  sexual, penetrating the blood of all the characters. They cause, not just see. The witches  in 'Scotland' are something the credits call 'hippies,' which I suppose is the gen-X  writerÂ‘s term for stoners. These guys are comic, possessed, ordinary people. That takes  all the gas out of this for me.

Want to see cool adaptations of Shakespeare? See the Ethan Hawke 'Hamlet.' Absolutely  right on translation: Hammy and his buddies as film students. Or Godard's 'King Lear'  with Woody Allen as the Fool.

A year after Jack Kennedy proposed going to the moon, this little thing appeared, presumably in the few city theaters that skirted pornography laws by showing fake documentaries of nudist camps. Some camps encouraged filming in a combination of exhibitionism, funding of their camp and (for some) promoting the paradigm.

Porn crusader Doris Wishman's first films slid into this genre, stretching it by adding a story. The story in this case is in the class of several others that are designed to be acceptably cheesy. In this case, two clearly inept scientists doze off while in their "ship." We see things from the younger scientist's mind, where he imagines just what you'd expect: a destination with simple, lovely topless women.

Like "Robot Monster" and a dozen others I've seen this year, most recently "Harriet the Spy" which shares other characteristics with this.

The oddest thing is how unattractive (and old) are the women, though the men are thoroughly buff.

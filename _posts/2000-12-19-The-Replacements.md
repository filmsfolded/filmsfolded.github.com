How horrible when you see good talent wasted. But I suppose the percentages are against always doing well.

Here's the 4th most common hackneyed plot: ragtag sports team makes good. But why Hackman and Reeves?

My theory: there really aren't that many good projects for actors like this: they are good working actors, who can deliver the goods, but they are not box office openers. So they can stay busy, but none of the choices are driven by their preferences. They do some serious projects, some that promise better pay, and some like this that just look like fun.

Reeves and Hackman walk through this, I hope having their fun. Perhaps only three weeks' commitment was needed. I hope it was worth it for them. It wasn't for me.

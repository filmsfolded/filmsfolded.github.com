I guess my memory colored this. I remembered it fondly, and pulled it recently as something to watch to warm the heart here.

I wanted a movie that wasn't much work, that would come to me, sugared and served. That's what I got, but I recall some nourishment from the past that seems to have seeped out of it. The anti-war message seemed strong enough at the time, but that was before the bloody lies of Vietnam, and the thing just doesn't register now. The edge is so soft it becomes a pretty protest, a decoration on history.

Another French notion that fades.

But there is one lovely and powerful cinematic technique here. It begins with the notion that humans create their environment. Here, it is a matter of the key people in this literally coloring the surface behind them. The last time I saw this as effectively was Emma Thompson's "Nanny McPhee."

TeeVee has had a few profound and probably bad effects on film. One of them is the notion of the filmed clever short story. 

We'd see it in spades in the following year in "Twilight Zone," as promoted by the first TeeVee celebrity writer, Rod Serling.

The idea is to literally write a short story that works on paper. Then film it with cheap cameras but "intense" actors. Richard Boone was already established as good talent along these lines and in fact established an acting school to teach just this skill.

The story in this case sets up a spooky situation, precisely so it can twist the end. It does, first one big way, and then a subtle teaser that undoes the twist afterward. Its probably a good short story. It seems so to me. Boone does his intense bit. Gravity.

There's a map that the simple cinematographer tried his best to make foreboding. Its no match for Boone.

This really is quite a travesty because it isn't cinematic in any way, anticinematic in fact and would make a far more effective radio drama. The writer of this would become known for developing the first computerized plot generator. Now that should tell you something.

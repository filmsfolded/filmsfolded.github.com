Spoilers herein.

This comment is for the episode: 'Dead on Time,' which I believe to be typical of the  'original' screenplays. Original in this context means not written by Dexter.

This is a pretty formulaic mystery, with the focus intended not to be on the mystery but  on the relationships of the people involved. Its not quite as heavy as the books, which is a  real shame. Gone is the boozy, depressed man of refined haunted hunches. Also missing  is the thick sergeant, both replaced by more likable characters.

They plod through the soap.

However, if you have the chance, see this episode for Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond)  before she took over that role. Here, she also plays the secretary to the mastermind, and  shares a secret love with a client.

She made a loving with Branaugh on stage. Then went through a long period with this  thin British TeeVee mysteries before entering the James Bond franchise. She's actually  worth watching despite the obnoxious TeeVee framing of her scenes.

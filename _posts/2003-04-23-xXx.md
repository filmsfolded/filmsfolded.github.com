Spoilers herein.

I know why kids pollute their minds with this ADD tripe. i know why there is a Hollywood machine eager to make small lives out of feeding their puppy lust. But Samuel Jackson has a lot of explaining to do. More rides on his success than just his kids.

Look, I love excess: 'Face/Off,' even 'Fast and Furious' were worthwhile. The latter was cool because of the way it made fun of dolts who value cars. It even played with some dangerous racial film notions of Asians. But this isn't Bond, because it takes itself seriously. It reminded me of "Runaway Train," even though it had a brief musical reference to "the Third man."

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Spoilers herein.

This film works for me.

Part of the reason is because I lived through this era and enjoy the validation of certain passionate commitments, albeit made accidentally.

Part of the reason is a perhaps unbalanced fascination with Garofalo. She has the subtle ability to diffuse herself into her immediate environment. Check out 'Mystery Men.' That's interesting enough, but here she plays a role which demands a more discreet charm, and she works it out.

Tripplehorn plays Michelle Pfeiffer and sad to say that even though she is no great talent, her Michelle is better than Michelle's own.

But the real reason this film works is that despite the cheesy crowd scenes and very bad script, the actors match the characters. The characters are one-dimensional people, who charm because of their focus. They have depth in being shallow so passionately. The actors are very similar. D'Onofrio is an ordinary actor who substitutes commitment for skill, hard work for insight, simplicity for dimensionality and thus rises to a perfectly appropriate token for Hoffman.

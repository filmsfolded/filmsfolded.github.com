Spoilers herein.

Once again, we have a film about a cartoonist (or writer or filmmaker) who is drawn into his own work. Conceptually, the notion is rich: one gets to support two simultaneous levels and play with the notion of self-created narrative. We've seen a few experiments along these lines that are intelligent. This one is along the lines of 'Misadventures of Margeret,' 'Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' and 'Monkeybone' which fail because they take the cartoon end too seriously.

The most interesting element is what drove Disney to explore such an approach. The second most interesting feature is the casting of Barbara Carrera. She is a fine example of what defines spy movies: exotic appearance, damsel in distress, obvious acting deficiency deliberately engineered to produce a characterless sex object. She is perfect, in fact, I'll see if I can find her anywhere else after this.

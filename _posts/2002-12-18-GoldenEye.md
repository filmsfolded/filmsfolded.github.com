Spoilers herein.

The formula is simple: girls, stunts, sets, wrapped in a comically absurd, self-aware notion of style.

The girls are a hard part, and except for the template: Ursala Andress, they've had troubles with this. Usually, it is glossed under the formula of the wicked and good girls fighting it out.

The stunts are also hard, in that mere money doesn't cut it already by the time of this film. Real imagination and skill is required.

This edition of the franchise may be the best so far as these two criteria. I haven't reseen all of them (17?) but Isabella Scorupco seems to have been born just for this (and little else to judge from the rest of her career). Here, she is made into a brainy dark redhead: actually believable -- can you imagine Denise Richards as the world's top nuclear physicist? She moves in a way that seems more natural (and east European) than most Bond pinups, and so endears.

I remember the stunts of this film and cannot remember much of any of the others: the bungee jump followed by the dive after a crashing plane, and the quite ordinary fight on the extraordinary antenna at the end. The only other stunt that registers is the balloonist assassin in London that opened was it 'The World is not Enough'?

Where the post-Connery Bonds seem to have trouble is in the sets. It was the problems with the ice palace in 'Never Say Die' that got me looking back. It lacked imagination. In the early days, all you had to do was skip from one interesting place to another, but that's been thoroughly worn out. Now, you need exciting constructed sets. The tower at the end impresses, but because it is unusual rather than exciting. The rest is ordinary, worthy of say Chuck Norris.

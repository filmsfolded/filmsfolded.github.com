Spoilers herein.

This is an absolutely dreadful film in every way except for the appearance of the remarkable Dunst.

She has turned out to be an ordinary adult actress, but as a child she was spellbinding. Here, the role is undemanding, but see the mark of a good actress in that she gives more than the pedestrian director demands.

Part of that young talent was in understanding how to create and use the 'Lolita mouth,' that reverse smile that can persist through the whole character. It is derived from a pout but turned into a token of engaged personality. We lost something when she grew up.

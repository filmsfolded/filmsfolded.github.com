This seems to be a practice project, one in which our hero goes through many tiny, subdued dramatic situations. You can almost see the assignment, the list of distractions, of indirect effect that need to be presented. It is done well, but its merely done. There's no effect.

I think this will be worth while simply as an example of someone working with intelligent notions in animation. Surely there is a lack of this. But its more of a workbook, a practice project. See "The Big Snit" instead, by the same guy.

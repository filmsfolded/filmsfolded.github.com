Spoilers herein.

Master Beatty has four interests, and one way of dealing with them all. The interests are politics, sex, movies (not 'cinema'!), and football. Here, he succeeds in combining all four, though all the casual sex is among the players not the characters.

His one way is to charm by patter while moving. It is a technical matter of timing that has its origin in athletics, quite different than a similar timing acquired by a dancer like Shirley. But he is good at it, here and in all of his projects.

Here, his friends Buck and Elaine keep him out of trouble. But what they bring is competence in designing skits. So that's what we have: a few skits strung together. This is TeeVee, not film.

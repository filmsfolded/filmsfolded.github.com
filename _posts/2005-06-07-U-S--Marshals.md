The worst thing about this, even worse than Jones, even worse than the cobbled together story, is the score. That music, the short little phrases, are indicative of how this is put together: lots and lots of small components, each one thought to have value, all paraded according to strict regularity.

The story is about two super special forces guys who graduated into spyland. One good, the other bad, naturally. Also naturally, they are introduced in reverse roles. This game of hiding and disguising is fairly trite.

What makes it marginally interesting is the appearance of two of our very best actors: Downey and Irene Jacob. Downey of course is best known for his ability to "fold" acting, play a role and a guy playing a role. This is something Jones will never even understand.

The surprise for me was seeing Jacob. Quality work must be really hard to find. She starred in Kieslowski's last and best film: "Red." There, she also managed the task of folding but on an much grander scale than Downey usually gets.

She has a tiny role, though notable in a perverse way because she is the pretty girlfriend of an ugly black guy, a milestone in American films. Yay. Now if we can do something about the portrayal of dumb women.

The disguise bit comes in also at what this movie is: a disguised "Fugitive."

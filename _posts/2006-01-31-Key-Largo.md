I saw this together with the TeeVee version of "Petrified Forest" and I was mortified.

That's because this is pretty bad.

Yes, I know it has some popular people involved in it. And I presume it was effective in its day.

We probably didn't notice that the actors (especially a young Bacall) are what Brando called lazy personality actors. Or that the characters and dialog are cartoonish, and not in the way we allow, but in a stagy artificial way. Or that the effect of the storm (created on a sound stage) really doesn't threaten, with shaking light fixtures and all.

It is to drama in today's context what Mystery Science Theater is to science fiction. We've moved so much in what we expect that this has become self-parody.

But it is illustrative of the battle that was going on at the time for the form cinema would take. It wasn't until 1941 that the matter was mostly settled. For the ten years before, all sorts of contenders were trotted out, one of them being this form: a stage play with some wild nature or scope that couldn't be conveyed on stage.

Fortunately for us, it is all but dead now. So when we view this, we somehow have to appropriate a different world. Its not simpler, what's happened is that the things we simplify have moved.

This is a good lesson in noir, which is the form that flowed into the hole left when the simple stage play was blown away by the storms of an evolving audience. Compare this to "African Queen" which has many of the same sensibilities, personalities and weaknesses. But it has fully abandoned both the reliance on theater conventions and the reliance on a stage.

The emotional pull is on the US appreciation for the silent war hero who helped rid the world of large evils through merely their natural (American) goodnesses.

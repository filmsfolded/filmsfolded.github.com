Once a genre takes hold it "comes alive" and does what it needs to do to adapt and selfishly survive. It happens in horror, especially in the vampire film. And it is happening in the high school film.

High school movies have the unique quality of recalling an experience nearly all of us have had. Plus, you have the simple fact that all teenagers are actors because they simply don't know who they are yet -- the brain just doesn't have the equipment. So they adopt one of the available roles; I believe there to be seven but some sociologists peg it at 5 for boys and 6 for girls.

In any case, its perfect fodder for films of the type I call folded: we watch actors playing characters who are actors. Since the roles they are acting are ones we know extremely well, we get drawn in. And that's the game, to make movies that engage us.

But at the same time we need enough novelty in what we see to keep us interested. We need both and excuse to _be_ in the movie and something (presumably something simple in general audience movies) to see when we are there.

So we get this adaptation of the genre. "Dazed and Confused" focused on second generation immigrants, incidentally immigrants from countries together almost an order of magnitude larger than the US. On a standard substrate we have superficially non-standard players. The entire movie consists of encounters with stereotypes and stereotyping. 

Now, the game is to guess what twist the genre will take next.

"Hero" was an amazing achievement in my mind: a multidimensional meditation on space. It had cinematic space, in fact every episode was designed to exploit some new way of depicting space. And it had space embedded in the story, the space of narrative options. These interacted as if a magical battle was underway for navigation in that space, and the conceptual interaction was after the manner of the fights depicted on screen.

It followed from the similarly ambitious "Ashes of Time," that merged and forked identities and overlapped stories.

But both of those projects had the amazing Christopher Doyle behind the camera. He seems to have a knack for depth and placement in place.

Now comes this. The story is a simple, familiar arc -- a tragic triangular love story. It has nothing whatever to do with the staging. That staging is impressive and lovely in spots just as it was in "Crouching Tiger." But even when dealing with a thicket of bamboo which we interpenetrate, it seems painted, flat.

Even when the final fight begins and snow magically appears, the snow isn't in space, but on the surface of a painting.

Even, even my friends when the signature knife throwing occurs, space is not visually exploited. Those daggers swoop and curve to come at the victim from unexpected angles. But we don't get the sense of space. Even "van Helsing" did it better.

Oh well, it does have one of the most appealing and graceful women in film. And some of the paintings are pretty. It is just a disappointment in comparison. Why make an ordinary movie after doing something important?

After this, I'll bet Doyle can name his price.

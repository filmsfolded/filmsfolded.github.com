I usually don't watch TeeVee mysteries, especially those created wholly for TeeVee. The restrictions of the medium are just too confining; its like having a friendship through cardboard. 

But this one was recommended to me for the way Shakespeare and mystery are folded together.

The Shakespeare bit comes from Hamlet. It comes in because the first victim supports the founding of a community theater. His son insisted that Hamlet be the first play, and after his father's murder and his uncle quickly marrying his mother. We see the scene in the play where Hamlet talks about performing a play within the play to "catch" his murdering uncle. At this point, the detective, whose daughter is playing Ophelia, figures out the murder. The brothers are called "King."

Some less specific elements are used: an Ophelia, a Horatio. 

There's also a second theme that is inartfully folded in. Its some business about masons: some of the suspects are masons, and the murder weapons were masonic items. This part is a mess.

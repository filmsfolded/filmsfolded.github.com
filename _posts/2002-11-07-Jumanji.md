Spoilers herein.

The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements:

--Kirstin Dunst at her peak.

--Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic.

--A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory.

--Some clever time folding.

--A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea. Not exploited.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

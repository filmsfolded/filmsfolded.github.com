What we have here is possibly the highest achievement of the studio system. Perhaps "Casablanca" as well, but there the idea was control. Here it is excess. Today, in order to make a successful film you have to depend on one person's vision to make sure that all the various effects are orchestrated. You can see that today, the more complex the movie is, the more skills involved and particularly is mixed artificial images, the tradeoff is either less of a single vision, or less adventure in what is attempted.

The studio system mitigated this. A studio had a shorthand for creative collaboration that seeped into the corporate culture, and it was never so effective as when the corporation is stretching outside of what it normally does. This was Warner's first elaborate big picture. There's magic in "Gone With the Wind," but that's all story. There's a different magic in "Wizard of Oz," but that's imagination and movement. And Judy.

But here what we have is the sort of magic where all the parts of the created world sort of settle into a comfortable alternative existence. This sort of movie-making is about creating a world that is enough like ours that we can see how the mechanics make sense, and not just so far as love and honor. Its all about the tiny things having to do with motion and color and causality. This world is simply coherent. There are edges, but the edges all form hidden story bits that we implicitly acknowledge.

Notable are two of the many textures that collaborate and meld on the way to our eye. One is the use of color. Its used architecturally, not attached to things but always as part of a composition, a harmonious composition that conveys sense. Brilliant sense, exaggerated sense, but coherent sense.

The second element, no small thing, is the assembly of Olivia's body. She brings parts of this assembly: more articulated thinner hips than popular for the time. The costumer has draped her like fashion designers only leaned to do in the late eighties, when superthin, superhipswinger models were used with rich flowing, rippling cloth so that you got a subtle scintillating movement. Its all part of the world dynamic as presented here. This is a world with eyebrows from the late 30's, womanly subservience from an imagined history but a lower body overt regality that seems to anchor the cosmology we imagined with Warner.

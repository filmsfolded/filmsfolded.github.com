Spoilers herein.

Stuff like this is loved by deconstructionists. The motives of HBO are crystal clear, built around a simple, vapid morality play.

The only reason to watch this is as an introduction to Jolie. Some actors understand the space between them and us and how the camera creates a channel. Others just grit their teeth and emote with commitment -- the Nick Cage type.

The better of these have some range, like Ben Kingsley. The worst can only play one character, essentially themselves. And so we have here, sad to say.

Jolie was part of one good project: 'Pushing Tin.' But even there we see that the casting community understands her 'box' is very small, so puts her in a very narrow range of roles. Even here where her commitment and energy are fresh, she comes dangerously close to a Zoolander self-parody. In fact, this film has merit as a sort of self-reference in that regard.

Spoilers herein.

This is a collection of TeeVee skits with no cinematic aspiration, which is about the lowest category one could possibly find. Sometimes such things can hit a sweet spot. South Park did for me. This did not -- you can tell a lot about yourself by paying attention to what you think is funny.

I found the main stuff unfunny. IO believe that is because film depends on other films, and film humor depends on other film humor. But there are no film references in the main material.

But I chuckled a little at a few subliminal cone jokes. For instance, there's a segment where Beldar is a driving instructor and the student gets a cone stuck in the wheel well. Everything is telegraphed here, and this can be the only reason for going to the trouble of inventing the profession. But that one visual gag was pretty clever.

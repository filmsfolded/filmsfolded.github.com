Spoilers herein.

The Marx brothers have three screen personages: the one we see here which is theatrical humor, the one which followed in which their mastered cinema, and one which we invented as we followed the maturing Groucho through his life. Of them, the first is the least funny, if the most accomplished.

These young men were still mining their stage routines here and most of the good stuff went into their previous project. It is just a bunch of incoherent bits bridged with random movement. Works on a stage, where we don't worry so much about the visual, nor a coherent fabric - and where the immediacy of their presence is more visceral. These limitations make this the least worth watching of their major projects.

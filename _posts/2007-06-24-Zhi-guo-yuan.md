I saw this with a film about immigrants in New York. The value in that film was to show me a culture I wouldn't otherwise see. This is much more powerful.

Its the oldest known Chinese film you can see. Its obviously staged on sets for easy drama, but I imagine the street activity (100% of the film) is close to genuine. I imagine the characters, though drawn dramatically, are based on those that would be common to citydwellers. 

So even though the story is daft, modeled after Mack Sennett, you can get a glimpse into a world that is completely gone today. And that's good enough for me to recommend this silly story.

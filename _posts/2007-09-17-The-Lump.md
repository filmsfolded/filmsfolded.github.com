At least it has a story, a sort of fable: a loser is employed as a gargoyle model. He grows a lump on the top of his ugly head that has a handsome face. He hides his real face and his life turns around, even Chauncey Gardener-wise becomes president. And not just president, but one that people admire, listen to and follow. (You might say: here's a drunk and crack addict who finds God.)

But because he still is a dummy, his vice president and advisers talk him into all sorts of crazy things that get him and them in trouble. Its a fable for our time.

Its animated using paper cutouts, similar to South Park, but with more detail. It doesn't quite work for me. I think its because the drawings (and photos) on the cutouts have to have some relevance to how they are used. The medium has to have some harmony among its components; if it doesn't, the tension carries meaning and the meaning has to be something we can reach somehow. This is disintegrated with no purpose, except that it can be done.

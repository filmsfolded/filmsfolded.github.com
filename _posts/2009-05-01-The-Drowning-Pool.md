What a lesson this is in how slight humor moves out of its zone in time! 

When this was new, Paul Newman delivered a perfect character, one with smart, funny lines, an attitude and a sexual presence. 

We saw New Orleans, which then by definition was something of a fun joke. We had sexual encounters with four sexy women. And we had one impressive stunt. Newman's character is trapped in an abandoned mental hospital. He and the villain's sexy wife have as few clothes as the raters will allow, and fill the room with water with the plan of floating to a skylight to escape.

When we saw this new, somehow we didn't care that Newman's 50 year old body was not attractive. The sexy women -- who include a seventeen year old Melanie Griffith, are by today's standards as outside the profile of humorous sex and the other humor is. Nothing works here, including the 70's shirts and hair styles.

When Newman finally thought he achieved a level of competence in acting -- decades later -- this would be one of the main films he would mention as horrible.

Except for Newman, Woodward and Lolita Griffith, all the actors were pulled from the TeeVee pool, and look like it.

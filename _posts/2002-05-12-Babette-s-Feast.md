Spoilers herein.

A huge disappointment. Food is inherently cinematic, and I was expecting some film magic (like Ang Lee's) combined with Karen Blixen's storytelling. Like Austen, Blixen deals with social drift causing individual discomfort. But Blixen focuses on ironic consequences. This is the stuff that produces powerful films.

But the filmmaking is the tritest type: the narrator says there were two sisters and we see them. She says they lived in a village and we see it. The pictures are just illustration for the text. The food appears not as a rich element, but as a mere prop. The preparation is only slightly touched upon.

Disappointment.

But what is worse is how the elements of Blixen's story are transformed for the screen. They are not transformed at all, but just marched through. So we get no screen incarnation of the infatuations and stilted futures of the two sisters. We hear about Calvinistic vision, but we dont SEE it.

Bilxen's art is to build many symmetries: the two unrequited loves, the two gifts unfulfilled (cooking and singing), the Preacher's words used for advancement (by the General) and stasis, the unrecognized grace of the Frenchwoman contrasted with the petty stabs of the congregation. Blixen's weaving is mechanical, but it is elaborate and all that is lost here.

Alas, another missed opportunity. As the film progresses, one gets the impression that Gabrial Axel is hiding his talent as part of a grand self-referential device, and will jump out at the end with his feast. No.

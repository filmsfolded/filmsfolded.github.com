Movie makers have always wanted to foist second rate goods on the public by placing a celebrity in them. It is costly to manufacture celebrities, so much better it is to find one from another field. Houdini -- already in his forties -- was about the most famous nonpolitician in the land.

This was deserved: while many of his tricks were straightforward trickery, some involved real risk and demanded incredible body control. For example, his escape tools were secreted in body cavities and recovered by what could only be described as yogic control. He painfully toured the country and exploited every opportunity available to such a showman. This project directly followed a famous trip to England where he challenged Conan Doyle to a showdown over spiritualism.

Hollywood was inevitable. But he hated it, and so did the public. They expected the same level of drama as in the celebrated stage shows and public escapes. He expected something similar.

While some of this seems lost forever, one can see why everyone involved considered it a loser, quite apart from the corny production values. He is transformed here into an inventor, a man of reason. This is almost completely opposite Houdini's stage persona, which inferred the occult while denying it. There could be no connection by the audience to the great magician.

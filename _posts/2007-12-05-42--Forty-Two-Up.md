Three things to say about this, which I consider the strongest entry in the series so far.

1) The point of these things has always seemed slippery to me. Ostensibly it is a study of the British class system. In reality, they've relied on simple voyeurism, cheap familiarity. But over time Apted's personal agenda has become clear. As a Xerox of a Xerox many times over displays the structure of the imaging system, over iterations we see what the filmmaker wants us to. And its all about mothers. With the exception of the final character, the somewhat pitiful Neil, every stroke, every arc, every dive is based on the notion of motherhood. Its cheap, but at least we now know.

2) There is a surprise in this one that was wholly unexpected by me. Until the last few minutes of this, we follow the model of 35 years. They exist, we see. The machinery of the film exists in our world, not theirs. Its obvious that they watch the results, but if they remark on it, it is about their participation, not the watching or making. But at the end, that takes an orthogonal shift and we see that the one soul at risk has been saved by the one soul that seems worthy, and this because of the intercession of the filming process. All of a sudden the project has become an agent in itself. Its a wonderful beam.

And that is quickly followed by a series of short comments about how participation has changed their lives.

3) Some of these people have grown not at all from when we saw them at 7. It isn't merely that they have not escaped their class constraints, they have literally been stillborn. Others -- a few -- have blossomed and matured, or changed. They still aren't interesting people in the slightest, but we do have evolution of spirit. I note this because it seems that Apted hasn't evolved at all in 35 years. The form of the thing is precisely the same. The intent, the style, the method. All as they were. There's a sameness of spirit that clouds this, as if no matter who gets married, divorced or born, life really does go on in the same way. Nothing real ever changes. Its particularly upsetting because he is us, in the bargain we make.

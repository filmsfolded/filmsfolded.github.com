This is a dreadful experience all around; a simple morality play suitable for afterschool audiences if you don't care about thinking children.

What makes it mildly interesting is the early appearance of Tom Hanks, who would become one of the select few to sell over a billion dollars worth of tickets.

Can one really look at the flock of youngsters today and predict their future? Did you expect Molly Ringwald to be big? My own view is that Hanks was a bad actor at the time of this film, and somewhere (probably 'Big'), he was given some coaching that opened his ability to play while controlling and control one's play. At that point, some good material overlapped his abilities. Since then, he has lost that spark and has been cruising (pardon the pun) on celebrity.

But here, he is completely indistinguishable from the gaggle of other young, unremarkable actors of this time.

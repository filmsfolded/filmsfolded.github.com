Spoilers herein.

There aren't many movies that try to work with architecture, so we need to celebrate them when they do.

Some have been hugely successful, like the second Harry Potter, and some largely incompetent like 'Life as a House.' A few rather effective for what they are: 'Camelot' and 'Thirteen Ghosts' for instance.All are based on principles developed by Welles and Tarkovsky.

What we have here is pretty competent so far as the use of the house, both as a metaphor and a device. It works well to add texture to the photography (with the water) and framing. All else (story, acting, editing) is too ordinary to spend time with.

Spoilers herein.

I watch film seriously, in part for introduction to new worlds. Sometimes that comes from personal contact through the lens.

Having said that, porn is never personal, by definition, it seems. But there is a scene in this that does contact, all the more shocking since even competent film-making in porn is rare.

The setup here, if you don't already know, is that our heroine has a stump for one leg. That stump is about the size and shape of a large dildo, and is employed as such while the film works its way down the list of must-have scenes.

All rather ho hum, if a little peculiar. Except this actress is a truly appealing personality, apparently in real life. Something of the Terry Garr phenomenon, where appeal is honest _and_ translates through the lens.

The interesting scene comes before the requisite lesbian rollaround. Jean is telling her friends what happened to her, with a hint of how she fell into porn. Its a longish scene and she cries. It's also a real and surprising film moment that transmutes this into something it does not intend. It may have originated in a prior film and been edited into this. I cannot know.

It seems a sort of parlor game to find and watch movies that are bad.

Well, we don't play that game here; we watch movies for their good qualities and seldom let bad -- even horrible -- production values get in the way of a good movie. By this measure, Ed Wood made some very fine movies. But this isn't one of them.

Some of his earlier ones have a purity of concept under the bad production. The world of those things is quite real, a world composed not of fragments from life but forces drawn from films. And not just films themselves but film archetypes.

But this one has an incoherent world under all the bad acting and story and such. I'll argue for the value of the others, but not this one.

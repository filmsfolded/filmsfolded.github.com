Spoilers herein.

These films drive me crazy. When I saw them when new, they seemed like avatars of a new future, one with an informed melancholy, a deliberate constructive ignorance. But all that has proved bankrupt. Watching these now is a matter of peering into another culture, except it isn't interesting. The point is nausea. There is no point.

What drives me crazy with this film is that it is number three on Greenaway's list of most admired films. There is circumspect composition here. And though the matter is vacuous, the narrative cleverly supports it. However, so many films are so much more powerful in all the dimensions of this one.

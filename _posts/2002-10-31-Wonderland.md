Spoilers herein

I do not know how I have gotten this far without knowing Winterbottom. I stumbled upon him in 'The Claim.' That film had a few powerful visions that accompanied well integrated narrative power. Some extremely deft camera notions. Exquisite enfolding of the music, which in that case was Nyman's as well.

Now here is something even better in its own way. It just blows me away because it is so intimate. I remarked on another little film about this same intimacy in looking at her in : 'Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her.' But here, there is a weaving and bobbing of the story, a similar weaving with the camera's eye, and an intense musical experience. The music, and camera is extraordinary alone. The acting seems special too, but I suspect it is ordinarily fine. The merger is the thing.

I'm usually satisfied with just a remarkable camera. DePalma for instance has a magical camera, but he keeps a sterile distance from his actors. Greenaway as well, and he used Nyman in exceptional ways. Not so here. This is what Aranofsky attempts: having the camera inhabit the personal space created among actors. The space is a little wider here because of the 'Short Cuts' platespinning. But the camera and music are much, much closer to the bone than in anything I have seen since 'Vanya on 42nd Street.'

I see a huge number of films, but with this one, I was transported to the drift of their lives. Oh, you absolutely must see this in its original ratio, not on some chopped up cable station. The peripherals are what matters. Visually of course, But if you know 'Alice in Wonderland' well, one question you ask is what do the characters in Wonderland do when they do not have an Alice to animate and motivate them? Its this.

Side issues: this has one of the best uses of fireworks I have ever seen in film. These three actresses are so open, their skin seems translucent.

Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching

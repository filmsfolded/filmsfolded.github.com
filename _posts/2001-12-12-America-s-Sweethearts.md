Spoilers herein.

Cat's Eye comments follow:*

This is a story about Hispanics in the American context of love. Film defines what love is to a profound degree. Forces are at work to overly simplify and idealize movie love, and that simplification and idealization is purely whitebread.

Here we have a film about a Hispanic guy who is in love with a film star, played by Zeta-Jones. He is faced with the age-old struggle between a love that is fed by passion, and a competing love fueled by film idealization. The story is self-referential: the dynamics of love are defined by film generally and specifically the film we are watching.

Wheels grind as Zeta-Jones straddles the border between Latin sex and that snappy hypnotism of film love (something she does in real life). Fortunately for our hapless hero, things turn out right for him but not because of anything he does. Instead, the 'perfect' film man accidentally falls in film love with Zeta-Jones' sister. Since she is played by Julia Roberts, we felt this would happen (or rather if we hadn't been told the story in the trailer, we would have felt it). In fact, the world will only be right when she is matched.

So we have the standard progression of film love: a directed glance, a kiss, a night in bed, and certain happiness forever. (The announcement is a copy of the 'Notting Hill' public confession during a press interview.)

The dissonance is that things are not clean. The two film stars don't end up living in a film world. What we have is two pairings each with one leg in the real world and one in the film world. But not really, Julia is hardly real world, the Latin lover has a minor film role. We are left with a strange sense of unsettlement about love. Guess that's the point: this would in effect be an anti-date movie.

*Cat's Eye comments result when nothing intelligent can be conventionally said of a film.

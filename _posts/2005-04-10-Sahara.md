A sad fact of big budget movies is that film-making is so cheap in Morocco. So for the foreseeable future, we're going to be struck with stories that end up in the desert. Helicopters will feature both in the story and the filming. And though labor is cheap, it isn't so cheap that the crowd scenes won't be mostly cardboard standups as the end has here.

You can have it one of two ways: you can have exceedingly little in the way of story so that the action can be the focus -- like the Bond, Indy and Rocky ilk. Or you can have a complex story that unfolds with surprises that the action amplifies, like the recent Bourne and Oceans examples. You can't have it both ways like this misbegotten artifact attempts. Let's see: world doom, local poisoning, a dictator, an evil businessman, a renegade crewman, an equally renegade doctor, a "National Treasure."

Satellite surveillance that can detect moving tanks but not a massive factory fed by constant rail traffic. Helicoptors, boats and jeeps that magically place themselves in the worst possible position. A hero inexplicably painted with orange suntan goop, someone who thinks charm and grimace are related. The Cooler as the hard-as-nails cigar-chomping Special Ops Admiral. (Such a beast does not exist by the way.)

Steve Zahn less manic than he can be. Miss Penelope less charming than she is. A complete lack of coherent style. 

Wow, and they still decided to promote it.

There was only one scene that wasn't painful to me, a wrecked airplane converted to a desert boat. But I liked it better in the movie they copied, the under-appreciated "Wind ."

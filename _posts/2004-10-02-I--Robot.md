Spoilers herein.

Some day, probably soon, we'll become overtly offended - revolt - when special effects are used to paper over multidimensional weaknesses. Some day, probably far off, we'll refuse to watch mugging celebrities in the place of actors. 

Some day there'll be more to stories than this. With due respect, though this movie has little to do with Asimov, Asimov's stories weren't all that well crafted or even intelligent. And this movie does have the double fakeouts, first Sonny then Robertson. But it is still mechanical.

And can we ever escape the notion of the rogue Hal? (And the girl scientist?) Philip K Dick had the very best one of these, I think, in VALIS. 

The idea could be clever, like in 'Forbidden Planet,' where the 'electronic brain' literally creates memories and reality.

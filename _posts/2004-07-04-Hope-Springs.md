Spoilers herein.

I predict this will become popular in film schools all over the world and with film-minded  students with Macs. That's because though this is a horribly dull film, it provides an almost  unique opportunity for fixing by someone wholly unrelated to the project.

Two ideas make this possible. The first is the fact that Firth's character is a sketch artist,  which for all intents makes him a cartoonist. That means that annotative content can be  created as animated cartoons without re-assembling actors. This is precisely the idea that  was behind 'Secondhand Lions,' but which was omitted because of meek studio bosses.

The second idea is that of making a film genre a character: of literally having two film genres  in the same film interact as characters do. Lynch did this in 'Blue Velvet' (and Mamet to  some extent in 'State and Main' - and also Kubric with three in '2001.'). What we have in  'Hope' so far is a complete 'character:' the insipid small town-centric romantic comedy.

Here's the hook: two genres struggle for our attention, represented by sweet Mandy (whose  film we have) and big-city magazine lady Vera, whose film we have yet to provide. Worldly,  intelligent and literate Vera really IS related to the founders of Hope, and it was her forgotten  comment that got Colin interested in the place. (The bit about Colin faking the relationship  thus becomes a joke.)

The picture will end with the cartoons of the townspeople debating the sides of truth  represented by Mandy (sense)  and Vera (sensibility). The cartoon stuff we'll add (after  editing the live-action stuff to 54 minutes) will be heavy material about the nature of  representation, from Colin's and VeraÂ‘s 'lies' to what it means to put something on paper -  from the Mayor's fakes and portrait to Colin's 'true' drawings to Vera's invitation.

I can see a great film emerging from this, one whose unnoticed fulcrum might be the born- again doof in the swimming pool. 

Class, start your Macs.

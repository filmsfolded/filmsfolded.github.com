Spoilers herein.

I appreciate this film for the effective way it has dealt with the vexing problems of how to accelerate effect through unfolding narrative (and by implication, action).

In conventional theater, the viewer encounters the action and imputes a narrative. Here the action is completely 'off-stage' and we encounter the narrator directly.

The normal way to register the narration is by default (as a disembodied observer) or by one of a few camera-specific effects devised by the filmmaker. Here, the narrator tells you directly what it means. Moreover he doesn't at all hesitate to pile layer on layer: not just what the story is, and what your relationship is to it; but further into what the choices are, what the penalties, what theater means to being human and why the challenges are at once more diffuse and pointed.

The aspirations of this are so grand and so completely satisfied that one both marvels at Shawn and laughs at the outrageous role he's put himself in here. Andre's experiences are so much in a hallucinagenic/mythical nature that no image one could put on screen could match that created in our head. It's as close to reading as you can get on screen 

This isn't quite as rich as Hamlet or Finnegans Wake concerning these matters, but it is a whole lot more accessible to the general public. I guarantee that if you view this a couple times before seeing 'Vanya on 42nd,' you'll have an enriched appreciation of what is attempted there: the same, but more subtly and indirectly, and collaboratively.

Spoilers herein.

I am writing this at a time when George Bush is still president, Michael Moore's film has just  appeared and the American people are beginning to understand what has happened.

We all grasp at the movie we live in. At the moment, the 'Republican' movie is in competition  more with alternative comfortable movies instead of real life.

'Red, White and Blond' is the standard of the conservatives: well-meaning (and white and  privileged) beats dumb. Stuff like the recent 'SeaBiscuit' is usually the matter of the 'other'  side: small guy against established, moneyed interests. But things are getting worse on the  message movie side as preachers of both stripes make movies about their respective  fantasies.

That's why I retreated to this wonderful film. It wasn't so wonderful when it was made. But  now the world has changed around this little thing and made it rich. I prefer to break it into  pieces on my computer and mix up the pieces 'Pulp Fiction'-like.

We have three pretty interesting actors, and arguably one of the best writers in the business.  They obviously were ahead of their time in finding humor in the bungling of CIA and  siblings, Shiite mob violence, 'Berber' factions, and bazaar chases. The humor is rooted in  the notion that all these goobs want to do is perform. The Army is rousted out to applaud by  command. Many of us can see the "Catch 22" inspired humor in this now.

Check it out and see if it doesn't better Michael Moore's effort. He needn't have tried so  hard.

That third interesting actor I mentioned above was the actress Isabelle Adjani. She would  segue perfectly from the last scene in this to the obsession of sculptress 'Camille Claudel,'  and she had previously been Herzog's Lucy in his vampire film which bears many  resemblances to this.

This film was a major disappointment for me, and is yet another example why you don't put actors in charge. Harris is an earnest enough actor, but a film project in general needs to understand the broader nature of the art of film. When it is a film of another art (dance, music, painting, even film-making itself) it requires an even broader stance. Else what you have is a story about just another schmuck with a messed up life.

There are so many elements of this story that Harris misses, but two particularly annoy.

First: Art, and painting in particular, consists of producing the actual artifact and simultaneously presenting a narrative about the artist and artifact to the consuming public. Van Gogh was a great painter because of both his work and his brother's publicizing of the artist's views. A trend in art history focuses more on the accident of the narrative than the talent of the artist, and Pollock is the key example. 

That's because what really made Pollock was the contemporary film of him painting. His energy. The notion of brushwork so abstract that the brush never even touches the canvas. The notion of isolation from the urban dialog. That film is misplaced in this story as coming late. I recall it came earlier, and was a key in presenting the art. 

So what's missed is the opportunity to focus on Lee as the real artist. Rather than being a sacrificing second-rate painter, she was the real abstract painter: brushwork so abstract she never even touches the brush. And the fact that the seminal film (of the real Pollock) is not exploited in this context is a tragically missed opportunity. Here, it is merely an excuse to fall off the wagon. A simple actor's device rather than a fulcrum for exploring cultural memes.

Second: Quite apart from the missed leverage of the historic film noted above, the medium of cinema as painting is completely ignored. Why shouldn't the nature of the film convey, at least in some small measure, the same ideas the paintings have?

Compare this to 'Vincent and Theo,' where the pictures on the screen mirror those on the easel. Also 'The Draghtsman's Contract?' It would have been so easy for us to get a feel of what Pollock intended if the approach to the camera had some of Pollock's feel. Instead we get Aaron Copland? Instead we get a literal, completely composed linear camera perspective? Instead we get something we can understand? Instead we get no management of color and rhythm? Jackson would have vomited.

Note the logical place for at least a titular statement of style, the sixty seconds or so right before the crash. No luck.

How great a film could have been woven around the notion of itself being art and also about art; of being a narrative of art and also a narrative about the narrative of art. Damn, we'll never know now.

This film is not bad because it is bad (like most films), rather it is bad because it is not good.

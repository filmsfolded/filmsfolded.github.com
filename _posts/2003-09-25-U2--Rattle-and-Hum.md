Spoilers herein.

It is almost impossible to make a successful movie of a concert these days, because the  choices are so few and most have all been done superbly the first time around.

This one is hampered by a decidedly unimaginative filmmaker who apparently used  pickup talent as he went from town to town.

Too bad too, because there is a story here that would have provided good, healthy  filmmaking grain. Before the period of this film, these guys had one good idea and were  able to leverage it to success in standard pop fashion. That idea was to shift the  continuity of the line in their music from the usual to a slightly unusual.

The usual had been a matter of riffs or drum/bass line or both. What they did was  substitute closed short phases there and move the continuity to either the lead guitar or  the vocal, depending on who wrote what. You can even see it in their costumes: the two  rhythm guys look like stevedores and just plink out standard phrases. The other two  affect "musician hair" and madeup one word names.

So far, not very interesting except in the history of pop. But by the time of this film, they  were tired of this simpleminded shift and began experimenting with all sorts of different  permutations on the same theme. This film is the record of their experiments.

They announce at the beginning what they are up to. When the Beatles created "Helter  Skelter" is was devised as a way to exploit the fact that each of them could pass off any  thread to any other Beatle and have it seamlessly continue. The title is literally from a  board game (in the US called "Chutes and Ladders") where rises and falls are passed from  one player to the next. It -- as performed by The Beatles -- is a masterpiece of woven  handoffs. There are five threads being passed around.

Now listen to the version that starts this film. Everything about it is choppy. They  deliberately throw away every element of continuity. Every phrase by every player comes  to a dead stop before the next one begins.

Now step through each chapter in the story and you encounter different, sometimes very  novel and appealing ways of tying the local continuity together, They do it the old way.  They do it with blues echos. They do it with overwhelming choir. They do it with a  haunting, balledic chant. They try everything they can think of and all the existing tricks.  Clearly, the music is much more articulate than they are about their music.

Folks, this sort of thing is the bread and butter of filmmaking. In fact, architecting a film  is a matter of selecting just this placement of narrative continuity and what relationship  that narrative has to who owns the tone.

But this filmmaker was either blind to the possibilities presented, or incapable of using  them. A shame. A real shame.

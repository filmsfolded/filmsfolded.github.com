Spoilers herein.

From the amazing talent of the writer behind Bullwinkle, we have a personal exploration of sibling roles/rivalry. It fails because he attempts something requiring skills he doesn't have: a sensitive reshuffling of expectations which simultaneously tugs at common strings. Naturally, a kid is exploited. We wonder where is the dog?

But there is one surprising thing: the writer appears in a small but pivotal role. He's pretty darn good -- in fact most of the players are. But they can seldom control the threads the writer hopes to weave.

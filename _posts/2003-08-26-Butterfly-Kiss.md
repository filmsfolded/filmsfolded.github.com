Spoilers herein.

I think a lot of Winterbottom, though he makes me work hard at it.

Superficially, his films are simple arcs inhabited by his tone and the actors' spontaneity.  In this case, we have what is almost a genre. Whenever I see "character study" I cringe.  And this has that veneer: something between "Fun" and "Invisible Man."

But just a simple scratch deeper gives something more worthwhile. "You" (Eunice) and  "Mi" (Miriam) are the same person, recounted by "healed" Miriam, who takes a completely  different actor's stance in the narration sections.

Eunice: promiscuous, chained, selfabusive, mercurial. Miriam: deaf, virginal, meek. 

The situations are dreamlike: lots of repetition with the entry into the petrol store.  Always the same first lines. Dreamlike consequences: no matter where they go or what  they do, the world swirls around them like a disengaged movie.

The butterfly is two wings on a single body.

I sought this out because I'm on a quest to understand the influence of Spanish-speaking filmmakers. I'm really impressed with the current crop wherever they live. Surely there's a literary tradition of folding behind this: Cervantes, Borges, Cortazar...

Now this isn't quite a Spanish film, it is by gringos and only references Spanish idioms. But it is interesting nonetheless.

It is the first film made with the three strip Technicolor process, so it is an audition of sorts. And the audition is for color and spice, if you will.

So the story centers on an audition and on spice, both wrapped in Spanish trappings. That allows our performers in the show within the show to be colorful, especially with greens and blues. Very nice.

The fellow that has to be pleased has an encounter with the girl who we are to receive as sexy. He blushes and a subtle red light is used on his face. Pretty good. The folding here is that the judge in the on screen audience likes the "color." And we are meant to as well.

Then there's a bit with two warring numbers, one the title song that mentions marijuana.

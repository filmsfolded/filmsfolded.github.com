Spoilers herein.

Pity poor Sean. He never really was a first rate actor -- more a speech technician --  but here he steeps in cheese. The plot: a showdown. The science fiction part: well, there's a spaceship I guess, but it looks a lot like any factory and no detail differs from 'real' life (including gravity!). This is every bit as bad as 'Battlefield Earth.'

Cat's eye comments follow:

This is a film about mice used in the manufacture of polydichloric euthynol. These mice are telepathic and can manipulate situations to ensure that they get the precursers, which incidentally is the source of their omniscience. For amusement, they decide to introduce risk into their own situation by motivating a loser 'sheriff' at one base to disrupt consumption of the drug. We enter the story with his unexpected motivation and follow the mousey episode that threatens the trade.

Because the mice are always in command, there is no real threat. Every move is predictable and each player acts just as the puppets they are. After this episode, consumption of the drug returns to normal.

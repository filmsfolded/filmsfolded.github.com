You can see the pitch: real life, dying children, desperate father, two bankable actors who have made money in action movies but who sputter otherwise.

In other words, there is no intent to put anything of value into this: it intends to milk us based on stuff banked by others. Unfortunately, everything -- other than cute kids -- that could make this work is flubbed. So you won't even cry and cheer like you might in spite of yourself. 

The funny thing is that Ford isn't bad. He usually is a black hole in terms of the craft. But the role is appropriately thin and he doesn't seem to be trying hard and therefore screwing up. It is the first I remember when my first reaction was to dump him.

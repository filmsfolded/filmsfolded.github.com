I think I'm going to watch Drew Barrymore more closely in the future. She seems to have a real sense about how to pull something off and have it work. She made that nice little period cinderella movie (Ever After), then the contemporary get a date movie (Never Been Kissed). Both showed a canny sense of cultural positioning, a deft recipe of corn, narrative flow and production values.

So she now wants to be an action hero. Who doesn't? Never mind that her instrument (face, voice and body) are ill-suited. She puts together a mix of Matrix, music video, and cheesecake that does what it is supposed to do, though probably for a different demographic than mine. There's no cinematic art here, just by now stock techniques. But what's impressive is her ability to do it at all. She could become a real moviemaker in the future. Winona has already fallen into the hopper -- maybe Drew will fly. I see she is producing and starring in a new Barbarella. Let's see.

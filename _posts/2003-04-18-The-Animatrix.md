Spoilers herein.

I'm not sure I understand why this is being made. Presumably, the goal is to advertise the upcoming matrix sequel in such a way that sets the stage for game and doll marketing. Industry studies show that the type of fantasy that drives the commerce targeting teens and younger does best when 'real' images are not used. So I suppose this animated project has the same relationship to the already mature Wachowski corporation as 'Yellow Submarine' did to that of the Beatles. It may be the one remembered as well, just as the Disney 'Alice' is.

I saw this in New York attached to the dreary 'Dreamcatcher,' and was really impressed. The snippet I saw was 'Flight of the Osirus.' It consists of three segments: a distinctly video-game-like martial arts encounter between two sexual stereotypes, a chase of a 'space' vehicle by a multitude of mechanized deathbugs, and the 'fall' of that same girl from the vehicle as she goes to send a warning to others. The last two are shown simultaneously.

Of these, the first and last are trivial, simple titillation. The chase scene was remarkable though. The 'camera' didn't do things that a physical camera would not (contrary to 'Treasure Planet') which I assume was an effort to make this more real and accessible to TeeVee-bred young minds. But the action was truly well choreographed so far as the colors and motion. There was a deliberate attempt to make some elements 'Akira' - like in having few facets and bold outlines, so that other elements could seem more dynamic and chaotic by heavy blurring.

A pretty good few seconds.

Spoilers herein.

This is not the Faye Dunaway of 'Chinatown' or 'Bonnie and Clyde,' or even 'Network' who understood how to layer herself under another actor.

This is not the Matt Dillon of 'Mary' or even 'McCools,' whose timing was inspired.

This not the Sinise of 'Snake Eyes,' who understood self-reference of the Reservoir' kind.

This is not the Spacey of 'Kahuna,' who instinctively knew how to weave a high energy ensemble.

This isn't the Fichtner of 'Go' who was able to fabricate his own world within that of the film.

This is a dream that mistakes their identities while they sleep, just as the plot indicates.

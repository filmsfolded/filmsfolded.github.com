Spoilers herein.

I must confess, I do not like Renny, or Sly or racing at all. But Stallone's last outing 'Get Carter,' surprised me in being visually intelligent. Harlin did well I think with the humorous 'Pirate's Cove,' with his wife. He seemed centered, sure. And though racing is rather like 'professional' wrestling (but with more stickers and girls), I think it has great cinematic possibilities.

Alas, the breakthrough racing film has yet to be made. What we have here is the same editing and camera placement we have seen in many, many films. What this genre needs is to be shaken up, like a 'Moulin Rouge' or a 'Blair Witch.'

I suppose if you are a young filmmaker filled with a desire to explore theory. And you studied in a particularly heavy school, you'll want to make at least one Kubrick-inspired project where you have three competing narrators, like his "2001." So you might start with an ice skater on drugs in a hallucination. People somewhere on the other side of the planet would start to float into space. Because you had lived on the ice, it would rise up and take over the world. The husband who left you would come back and comfort you until you die in a blizzard. Your slacker brother who supplies you with the drugs would get his due.

The entourage that supports you are conspiring leeches who have lookalikes in the wings ready to replace you. They would all be shot on the ice while imitating you.

The filmmaker would choose another narrator, the husband. He'd be a typical noir narrator, starting with a voice-over announcing that he is already dead, would die in a few days. As with a typical noir, odd things would happen according to no logic. He would be swept up in an inexplicable fate while he as detective tries to discover what's happening. Matters of the heart are to some extent adjudged by him, and he as a sort of noir jinx kills those who happen near him.

And then there'd be a third narrator, the viewer. The viewer not only of the film but of the ice skating, and the several celebrity TeeVee shows here.

This all has the basic material to be an extraordinary movie. Absolutely extraordinary. But as with so many other good thinkers in this community, he just isn't a very good filmmaker. There's no cinematic sense.

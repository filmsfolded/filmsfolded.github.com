Spoilers herein.

The picture that started Jackie's career. I found it fairly boring except for a few moves  and the amazing dexterity of the old man (at 66). He does a bit with a rice bowl that has  to be a classic. His son directs, and would in fact be directing him at 70. Imagine dying at  70 doing a martial arts movie directed by your son. That's the way to go.

This has humor (even the subliminal madness of the names of the techniques) and fights  but not yet humorous fights. So it is really only of passing interest as a film, But that old  man!

Spoilers herein.

Possibly nothing is more fun than filmed Shakespeare, because few things offer as many paths for reflection. Shakespeare himself invented the reflective human in the first place, and the play itself has power. But anyone looking for this power doesn't go to the movies, they read the play. There's just too much engagement and too many levels to appreciate without the magical space that reading creates.

No, we go to the movies to see what people have done with these opportunities. Its a metatext of sorts. Engineering a film like this is a matter of tradeoffs and (in the best case) commitments to a world view that because of the richness of the plays can be as rich themselves. Olivier did not understand this because he never understood film. But Branagh does. In his films, he does not make the choices one would expect: centering on the actor and emphasizing the language. Instead, he focuses on the space between the film and our minds and engages in an internal dialog about being and representation. He's chosen the few plays that work well with this.

But Branagh is only a player here, and the decisions have been made by Parker. Parker is a smart artist who takes a wholly different approach; he's done it here and with the Wilde projects afterwards. In this world, the language is the center: not the metaphoric abstractions, embellishments and introspections but the language as a dramatic citizen. That language is imbued with force. Around this force, everything moves.

Fishburne is a good choice for this strategy. I know of no other black actor who works with the language this way. Its a particular challenge for african-americans because the use of language takes on a personal identity in that 'culture' and most black actors leverage their identity as a tool in addressing a role. Not Fishburne, he's a real actor in the sense that he understands the difference between who he his and what his instrument is.

Branagh is given a strange task to do here. His special strength is the ability to create that abstract metalayer, put it between us and keep it alive. But Parker will have none of that. Instead, all the metastuff is pushed into the more direct method of Iago's looking at and speaking to the camera. Its not very satisfying, but one can see why it is done.

Similarly, Desdemona and all the other woman are treated by Parker the same way he did with his Wilde adaptations: they are secondclass beings, existing only as marks for the movement. Demoting her thus was necessary for the strategy I suppose. But it is a major loss, transforming the play into being about Othello alone, instead of the rich confabulation of conflicting forces of life in the 'real' play. She has her erotic moments instead, but this is like the Branagh camera-glances -- a pale substitute for her richer life of sense and passion.

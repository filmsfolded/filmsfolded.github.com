Spoilers herein.

I'd say Green had the first Muppet Movie in mind when he made this. That film was about an Odysseian voyage to be in film, and the film the frog was in was the film of the voyage.

That film was about people in animal skins (and half and half) and this one is too. That one was supposedly for kids but really targeted adults. This is the exact reverse.

How a muppet is operated is by, well, sticking a finger up its butt. Girlfriend Drew got her big start costarring with a muppet, E. T., whose major scene involved his finger!

Both Green and Kermit the frog are green.

Just an idea.

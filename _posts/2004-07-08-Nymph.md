Spoilers herein.

I search out architectural films. One of the most interesting is 'Liebestraum,' which conflates  sex and space. Here is another that is a little heavier on the sex but still has a clever idea  about space.

The space this time is an apartment building. There's some soft business about Indians  resulting in a timeless 'nymph' being tied to the building. She can be in many places at once  in different persona. She is a slave to mist, needs it to inhabit. She can manipulate memory.  She is sexually needy, hungry. She is completely pliable. These are great metaphors for  sensuous architecture. 

As porn, I guess it suffices.

Spoilers herein.

Consider this the evil twin to 'Takedown.'

In true hacker tradition, you start with the files, in this case something that really happened.  Then you have two parties breaking into the sanctity of journalistic truth and hacking them  for their own purposes.

First we have the shameless version by Shimomura. I know scores of people who really work  for the good guys - many brilliant minds. We are all ashamed of his version, which has been  cracked and shredded from truth. And Miramax should today be castigated for trumpeting  itself as the good guys (because of its distributing Micheal Moore's entertainments).

But that doesn't justify this similar hatchet job. It does feature an embarrassing interview  with a dumb journalist - as if we were supposed to be surprised. And it raises clear gaps  between what Kevin might have done and what some wildeyed prosecutors claimed. (Kevin  was more a talented con man than cracker.) But none of this was harmless prankstering, and  this hacking of the truth is as sullied as ShimomuraÂ‘s.

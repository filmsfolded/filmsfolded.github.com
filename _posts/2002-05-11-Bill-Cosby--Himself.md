Spoilers herein.

You are what you laugh at. And what you choose to think funny invents you. When enough people find a humorist and laugh, a society is changed.

Consider: here is a man whose jokes are not blue (sex jokes are always class jokes). Here is a black comedian whose routine is not based on some corporately-defined cultural difference ('white folks are prim, we is cool'). 

Think about it. Cosby saved the situation comedy and incidentally NBC. He may have saved the US from a real race war by his simple humanity -- by employing avuncular timing and describing simple family characteristics.

How many recorded concerts can you watch that are both historically important and damned funny?

Spoilers herein.

There exists a certain class of men who can perform magic, who affect souls across  distance. Some of these 'go bad' and strike at will, committing evil. This is a story of one  such who captures women, both literally and photographically and sells them.

Yes, the story is about this, but more important the film itself is a case of this. Brian  Grazer is a man to avoid. He is worse even than Spielberg in sucking the life out of  something for cinematic effect.

See, that's the problem: drama is magic. One has to do things unnaturally in order for us  to perceive them as natural. There's the art of this unnaturalness that can become an  obsession in itself. Glazer and Howard are getting very good at it in the sense of finding  things elsewhere that work and then using them without any alteration, without any  originality. Worse, they apply them in ways that are close to what the real drama requires  - but not close enough.

The effect is of something that is competent, glossy, ostensibly powerful but when you  go to tap it, it evaporates.

Here in Cate we have one of the few substantive actors alive, someone who knows how  to tie truth and effect, how to be falsely true. And she has been captured by this band of  filmmakers who dress her in cheap 'finery' and try to sell her to us.

This is rattlesnake dust tossed in our eyes; it really will do damage unless you already  have the antidote.

Tommy Lee does his standard bit, Scarlett McAlister looks scared and the rest are mere  plants in the environment.

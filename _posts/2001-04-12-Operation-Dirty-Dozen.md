What a film is and how it is marketed are usually different. The film itself is a comparatively raw take on war. A central element is the contrast between the British and German whores, and the burning alive of the latter with their masters in a makeshift furnace. The film also has some quaint cultural elements, especially the handling of race, but for Hollywood, it was quite a statement.

But you can't sell statements. So we have this advertisement which emphasizes the mod scene of London. Both films have lost their punch as the culture has shifted. But this is most strange: essentially the Beatles and the new drug culture (strictly anti-war) are being used to promote a pro-war film!

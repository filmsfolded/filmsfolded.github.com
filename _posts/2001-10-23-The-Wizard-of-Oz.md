Spoilers herein.

As a film, this ranks pretty low on my charts. But as a stage talent, Judy Garland is one of the best and this is quite a performance. She really does work hard to make us fall in love with her, which of course we cannot resist. Here she is quite fat, which reminds us that by now she was already heavy into speed and sex.

I met Noel Langley in the 60s and he insisted that he wrote the screenplay to emphasize certain spiritual symbology. 

The contrast between these two facts fascinates. Why are gays so attracted to Judy? Why do Christian fundamentalists see this as the Devil's work? Is this the eighth gate?

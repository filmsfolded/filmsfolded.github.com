Now it is acceptable to make films where the hero is just plain stupid. It is set up for us to like the guy, even celebrate him. Quite probably, this is a result of political advertisements that convince that intelligence is somehow a reason for mistrust. It is not new, I know, but the widespread acceptance of it is true. The dumber, the better. 

Before that, we have movies with less severity where the hero was just plain naive. He would be an intelligent, honest, even brave man but out of his element. There would be some jokes about this, but his good nature would see him through. These films go all way back. 

This one came along after a drought of a few years it seems, so seemed new. Our guy is established as a rough and tumble fellow. He might be engaged in illegal work, or perhaps he is chasing off poachers. The choice is ours, but we know that he was adopted by "the blacks," and has some of their magic. 

He comes to the big city. The movie revolves around him winning the hearts of the New Yorkers, and getting the girl. 

The fold here is mildly interesting; the girl is a reporter, writing a story about him, and she basically falls in love with the story. 

But watching this now makes me embarrassed for a whole decade. This was actually nominated for an Oscar. The public liked it and screenwriters in the Academy thought the screen writing was so good it deserved recognition.

It has two appealing set pieces. One sold the movie in the trailers. It is the deal where he is accosted by some street thugs who pull a knife. He pulls a bigger one and they run away. The other clever writing is the zinger at the end where New York working men relay messages of love across a crowded subway station. On her affirmation, he literally walks on top of them to get to her, while the crowd (representing us as audience) cheers. Four seconds of embrace with rising music and the end. 

But in between is some tired, repellent stuff, even the joke about confusion over plumbing appliances. I think the girl here was writer-actor Hogan's real girlfriend. There is no other way such an unappealing actress would have been selected. She is ghastly.

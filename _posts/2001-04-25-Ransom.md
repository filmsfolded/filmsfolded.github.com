Spoilers herein.

Gibson is a commodity to be packaged. One can readily see how this film was conceived. First, tests and surveys report that they like the look on Mel's face when he gets angry, then with determination grinds out revenge. This makes money, it has been proven over and over. 

Patriot and Braveheart are one formula which follows a battle thread, which exploits our desire to be led. Here, they dust off a thriller formula that is cheaper to make and exploits our desire to be passionate parents. Howard is called in as a formula-delivering workman.Some plot devices grind out scenes where he can show that glinty determination. Eventually, he viciously bests the beast after the precisely determined number of minutes (a constant regardless of the formula).

The only interesting thing about this is the wonder of why we like it so much. Is there that much in a single face? Do we make it important, or does it create its own meme?

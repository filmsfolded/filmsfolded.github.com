Spoilers herein.

Here is the Disney Buena Vista formula: find or build a story based on a very simple moral. Being all you can be is good. Make the characters thin (figuratively) and endearing. Build the whole thing around sweeping music. Disney has the best music shop in the business, especially for telling us what to think and when. Turn the crank.

In so turning, emphasize the opinions of others as the key plot device. The climax should take place with a crowd you have won over.

This is worse than a waste of time. This can damage your ability to critically think when you encounter a real film. I don't say that often with film (always with TeeVee). But this one is particularly pernicious and subtly patronizing.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Spoilers herein.

Dame Agatha must be turning and turning. She spends her energy finding that thin  edge between disclose and confusion to tantalize us into a game. It is among the most  engaging trick in all literature.

But along comes the heavy boot of TeeVee which (apparently) demands that people don't  want to think, so jettison all the clues and games. Bowen's other adaptations usually plod  on and surprise us all at the end. We are not detectives, but among the puzzled people in  the parlor to whom explanations are made late.

But this is the worst. Christie often gives indirect clues by setting a theme: here it is  illusion, the illusion of magic, of theater, of film, of ballet. He saves all this but makes it  blunter. He saves some of the red herring events, but doesn't ripen any of them: what  was the 'student' doing by sneaking out? 

Why do the brothers seriously chase a married woman? Of all the Hickson Marples, this  one has the greatest distance between the coherence of the book and the incoherence of  the adaptation.

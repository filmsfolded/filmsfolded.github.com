Why is it that any film marginally close to being marketed for kids needs to be tightly wound around a moral? Its annoying because what they serve up -- with few exceptions -- are so narrow and silly they damage anything they touch. 

This is one of the worst offenders I have experienced. The assumption I suppose is that since this is for kids, and people who want to be kids for a while, it has to be "easy to read." So instead of starting with a narrative that has strength and color and weaving lessons and drawing cases, they start with the pill. Then everything is there to prop it up and make it pretend to be a story. Some of this scaffolding consists of jokes of various kinds, the chief engineering of the narrative being what kind of jokes to use.

So a snake of a lesson surrounded by a fog of petty jokes. What a disaster.

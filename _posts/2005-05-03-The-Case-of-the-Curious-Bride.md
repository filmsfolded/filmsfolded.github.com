Together with the noir and the musical, there isn't anything more important to the shape of film narrative than the detective story. And among that, you have two poles, represented by the two greatest sellers of mysteries ever: Christie and Gardner.

Christie by far the more sophisticated of the two, engaged in a guessing game with the reader from page one. Each of her stories toys with some element of assumption, of perception. Gardner's approach was to set up an impossible situation, then surprise the reader at the end with an elaborate ballet of comings and goings around the corpse.

Gardner's work was extremely formulaic, in fact he actually used a circular slide rule of sorts to make up stories. There were other devices employed in his rather automated "fiction factory." His template of formula and avoidance of challenging the audience was a more popular fit for movies, alas.

This is his first movie. He hated it because it tinkered with his formula to create a Perry that compared to Nick Charles, the breakout character of the previous year. So we have an effete humorous character, a gourmet cook overlain on our original mechanical mind. And -- good luck for us -- the setting is San Francisco only a generation after it was destroyed.

The direction alone is worth it, even if you don't appreciate the grand struggle for control over the shape of film narrative. Curtis moves this thing along with a rhythm that matches the cheery elite meals referenced in the dialog.

Perry watchers will be particularly interested in how Della Street is handled here. In the stories, she is a loyal machine, as efficient in her way as Drake and Mason. We always know she is in love with her boss (just as Gardner's secretary was) but it is only hinted. Not so here. She's so mooneyed she's almost drunk.

Oh, the story itself is tepid. Philo Vance would be doing much better.

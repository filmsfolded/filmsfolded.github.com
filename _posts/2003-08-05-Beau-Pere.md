Spoilers herein.

Nabokov's "Lolita" is a milestone in literature -- the narrator is obsessed to the point  where anything he says is at least synthesized out of that obsession and at worse  fabricated. It is only about sex in so far as giving a focus to the obsession of being.

Here we have a very clever converse. Yes we have the stepdaughter, the "artistic"  stepfather widowed by a car wreck and the copulation between the two. We have a child  with the flue, and a key message delivered in writing. Performance permeates.

The difference between that message in the book and this film mirrors the difference  between the perspective of the two. In "Lolita," the reading of the diary comes  immediately before the accident and is unintended. Here it comes immediately after and  is.

The story this time is from the girl's perspective. She is the one with the obsession and  the seductive initiative. It is he that is wrapped up in performance and who is tempted  away by a superior performer. Just this depth of understanding of such a radical  experiment in narrative colors this film as something worth watching.

(The designated watcher in this version is the redheaded wife of a fellow musician.)

But otherwise, the film is a pedestrian affair. A few titillations, a few comedic moments,  some sweetness. In other words, it carries all the baggage of a normal French film. It is  bereft of, say, the lepidopteran -- or similar -- metaphors, the constant shifts in  narrative layers (by this time, 1981, by no means experimental) and the references  outside the film.

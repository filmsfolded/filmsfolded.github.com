Spoilers herein.

Here's what happens when you mix real talent with pretenders. Mamet is one of the smartest writers we have. Here, he writes around a genre, twisting it beyond parody to a potentially intriguing battle of wits shined through the disturbing mediocrity of life. That mediocrity is represented here by the predictability of the genre and all the standards associated with it. In a good director's hand, it would shine.

That this director doesn't get it isn't the biggest sin in the world. This is pretty sophisticated stuff after all. But it is once again a sign that Anthony Hopkins is completely lost in the world of ideas about film. Utterly baffled, he plays this as straight as rain.

At one time, his timing, his cadence, his reading of lines was inspired. Possibly "Elephant Man" was his high point in film. But after this, and the similarly confusing "Titus," he has become a joke.

Watch him closely here. He takes the marvelous dialog, and when he is finished, he really is no better than anyone else in this film. He, Elle, Baldwin and the bear, all at the same level. I wish the lover had been played by Johnny Depp. I wish the billionaire had died. Don't you?

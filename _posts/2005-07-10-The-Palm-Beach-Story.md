If Preston Sturgis did nothing but "Sullivan's Travels," he would have lived purposefully.

Everything else is annotation. This is not a good movie: an unfunny screwball. But it is interesting as heck if you know Preston's story.

Our hero is an inventor that can't make good. His wife exists purely to provide sex. She's unabashed and single-minded about this and from her perspective that's the way some girls are meant to be.

He won't let her use her sex appeal to his financial advantage, so she decides to leave him for more moneyed pastures. In due course they fall among an ultra wealthy family, where wifey succeeds in turning her sex into cash, big cash.

Sturgis was an inventor, a rather successful one in terms of ideas but not money. In fact, his entry into movies was because of his failure in this regard. He was also famously obsessed with sex, sort of an earlier Warren Beatty in town. He was able to concoct stories that allowed him to mingle among the rich, as depicted here.

Our sexy wife has some nice gowns. But there has a been a whole vocabulary of cinematic sex appeal that has been invented since then that she lacks. And all the regular conventions (the Clara Bow, Lana Turner model, lets call it) weren't followed either. She expects men will react to her raw appeal. But we the audience don't. Can't

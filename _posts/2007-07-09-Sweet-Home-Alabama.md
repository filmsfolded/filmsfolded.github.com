To prepare for this, I watched two Disney "afternoon" movies. You know the kind: about finding solid relationships with parents after a tiff, and in the process "finding yourself."

This is a red state movie. It celebrates dumbness. So was "Legally Blond," both ones, and the second "Blond." That was made after this and was explicitly political. They would be (at the time of release) guaranteed a 50% built in audience, folks for whom a half billion dollars of Republican ads have softened up.

Watch it today, when that audience is less than 20% and see if it offends you with what it underwrites.

Spoilers herein.

Kubrick's '2001' film becomes ever richer over time. At the same time that countless successors copy shots and visual devices, they all miss the central genius: it is entirely visual and asks more questions than it answers. We leave it newly tuned, our minds active, our imagination sharpened.

How sad then to re-experience this film. It copies some of Kubrick's visuals and adds the magic of the then state of the art. But it does so soullessly. Everything in this movie is explained, and explained in the most tedious, uncinematic way -- by someone talking to us. It is dreary and lifeless and makes us root for the higher beings to just put us all out of our misery.

Kubrick's magic was that he invested his environments with life. Then he turns the narrative over to them just as Altman does with his actors. Although many people didn't get it, dePalma's 'Mission to Mars' is a worthy successor to '2002.' This soft stuff of 2 "2010" is gelatinous.

I keep coming back to this genre in hopes of something new. Or if not new, then at least the old delivered competently. The genre is simply characterized: the haunted house movie.

Now in these things there are ghosts and stories about ghosts of course. But the chief character is the building itself.

There's a cinematic reason for this which I think is related to the great American invention of noir. The essence of noir is that our hapless characters enter a world of capricious fate where events seem orchestrated to jerk them around.

The haunted house movie is related in being a localization and sometimes personification of that environment. When I enter these films -- as the characters enter these buildings -- we enter a world that is not just haunted, but haunted by forces of cinema. Its a very strange feeling that has little to do with fear of the dark. Its fear of having our own (cinematic) imagination get out of control. 

"The Shining" is perhaps the best constructed if these, but I'm partial to "Liebestraum" too.

There are so many of these, and they'll surprise you sometimes. "The Attic Expeditions."

In this case, we have many of the ordinary elements: dreams, visions, reinvented pasts, loss. What's slightly different here is the image of creeping dark water, fluid noir that saturates.

And that takes me to my main point, about the national character of the filmmaker.

Cultures really do have cinematic stances. Czech films are buttery and Polish ones lacy. French ones bogged down in trivial self-reference from three generations back. Italians chew the sense of character.

Thank god for Australians and Canadians and their clarity. But the soul of richness right now, all the advances in how we imagine is in the hands of our Spanish and Spanish-speaking filmmakers who suspend layered worlds before us. And it doesn't seem to matter all that much if they live in Spain, Mexico, Hollywood or France. We depend on them.

Its a blunt observation and practically useless, like all obvious truths.

So, I am asked whether this extends to Portuguese, which includes Brazil. Actually, there are lots of nice things to say about Brazil, its music and energy. But not about its films, and I don't know why.

Salles (director of this mundane outing) and Meirelles (who has music and understands pacing) are the two apparent leaders in Brazilian film. They are, simply Italian in their sensibilities, and this can be seen as a mere giallo with no guts.

One effect of the DVD afterlife of theatrical films is that it empowers ever-narrowing demographics. These are of interest to me. 

What works in movies is largely a matter of shared jokes, fears, hopes. These are largely adopted as part of the story we adopt in defining (or if you prefer, finding) ourselves. One apparently new demographic that has moved from cheap books and afternoon TeeVee to the big screen is sexually aware 13 and 14 year old girls. In the transition, the sexual sweeps can be bigger, the caprice more intense. 

I'm interested in the target stories of this demographic because a dear friend is working in that area.

The humor is always about embarrassment. The drive is simply about attraction and rejection. Appearance is essential. Sex (or love, in this language) is inevitable. Justice always backfires. The movie is a throwaway for me, but that's because I'm pretty far from its target, and its target story from mine. But it is interesting as all getout to watch it and through it get a glimpse into the larger movie being written and acted in hundreds of thousands of schools by millions of girls.

Global warming? You bet.

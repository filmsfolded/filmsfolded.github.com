Spoilers herein.

This is phenomenally bad, so far as strolling through all the standard elements, so I'll just focus on the spaceship.

Most films are about other films, and most especially scifi films. Its like case law, each one cementing some standard that bears little relationship to the original logic. Nowhere is this most obvious than with space ship design. We have three basic types: the long spindly affairs from 2002; the grey beasts in different shapes from the likes of *trek and *wars. And then we have stuff like what we have here: art deco gold ornaments from 50's pulp covers. Its cheaply done here, but is at least something to recommend this stroll through the ordinary.

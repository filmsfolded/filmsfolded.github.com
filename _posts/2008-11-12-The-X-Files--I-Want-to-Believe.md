I am puzzled as to how a supposedly rich franchise can be turned into an episode of "77 Sunset Strip."

I don't know the TeeVee show, but I understand it was at least engaging through a suspended sort of open mystery. I saw the first movie. It struck me as lowbrow Lynch. It was the Monkees to The Beatles, but at least engaged us in an open world mystery. 

I guess that didn't sell enough tickets. I guess that as dumb as it was in working up simple rules of the universe, it wasn't dumb enough.

There is an interesting portrayal here of a psychic pedophile priest, a concept that by itself is a fascinating idea. The story is interesting to me because of the narrative folding: one of the priest's molested boys is the serial killer and there is a complex cocreation of reality from one to the other with a connection that is both telepathic and bending causality. If they had stuck to that plot device and elaborated it, they would have been okay. 

But they larded it up with some romantic business and the grind of a police procedural.

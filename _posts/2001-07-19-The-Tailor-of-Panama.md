Spoilers herein.

Sometimes the soul of a book is simply in the story, and that at least gives the film adapter something to leverage. But most good books give value not only in producing a narrative, but producing a perspective on that narrative which is rather difficult to translate to film.

The writer here moved into new territory for him, a maturity reflecting an understanding of his own limits. Le Carre's books are well-done fabrications -- good storytelling, or at least good enough to sell books. But he is intelligent and honest enough to get bored with that, so here he explores the debilitating pull of the reader: the story needs to be ever more titillating and more strongly supportive of the psychology of conspiracy. Congratulations to him for putting Ludlam and himself in perspective. Too bad that the point is largely missed in this film, which more or less plays it straight.

Rush played the same role with the same goals much better in 'Quills.' He has some talent for this sort of dual role: in the narrative and creating the narrative. He's not my favorite for this (Penn and Winslet are), but he is definitely worth watching when he is supported. Here, he is not. Curtis just doesn't get it, and that's deadly enough. Brosnan doesn't have to get it: better if he doesn't. Cruz probably could get by on the natural South American awareness of this effect (even though she is European).

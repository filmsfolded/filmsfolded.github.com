Spoilers herein.

There's nothing like this stuff. If you ever thought Kubrick was a genius, you should consider that such an eye is not learned, and one would expect to see it in the young man. Here's where he is taking chances.

He produced, wrote, directed, photographed, and edited this effort.

Here you see some real energetic expression of more controlled notions you see later on:

-- time and space symmetries, lots of them

-- lots of narrative in inanimate objects from the environment

-- dancing/boxing: life as a test performance, with the space between being dead time

-- narrative folding

-- a mimimalist, deceptively symbol-laden story that all but ignores the actors

-- a consistent 'eye,' often from waist level when the lovers are together

-- stylized voice-over

All this is fascinating enough. But an extra treat is to see this next to Welles' near masterpiece 'Lady from Shanghai' of "48. Check out showdown in the manikin warehouse compared the manikin part of 'Lady's'  funhouse at the identical part of the story, with the same loser-woman dynamic.

Irene Kane has real presence despite her relatively poor acting. Kubrick married her ballerina 'sister.' Wonder what happened to her?

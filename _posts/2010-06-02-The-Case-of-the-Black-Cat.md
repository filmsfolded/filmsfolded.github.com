This is formulaic. But that is a very good thing when the formula is very good. And this formula is terrific. When it was designed -- and it was very clearly specified -- it was designed so that the plugged in variants were so powerful in the narrative twists that each mystery seemed unique. The setup with the characters was nothing new: a mistress/secretary, a thorough detective/colleague, the easy familiarity with the prosecutors and police.

What was new was the balance between trial lawyer and murder detective. 

The trial is an inherently cinematic device: a place where narrative can be both shown and explained. It is a device whereby all sorts of narrative perspectives can be shifted among, allowing for shades of untrusted narration. Gardner took the Agatha Christie's device at the end of her mysteries and expanded it. Christie had all of the suspects in a single room while Poirot or Marple recounted the solved mystery, but in a way that did some fast shuffling. Gardner integrated that into a cinematic setting that allowed for the untrusted narration and discovery to be spread through the detecting.

It is brilliant, and well exploited in how Gardner devised twists within each of his plot modules. Here we have an old Christie trick where neither the body nor the original murder is not as thought. The twist is at such a radical level that even today this thing thrills. Narrative structure matters. It can make up for tedious stereotypes, bad acting and poor production.

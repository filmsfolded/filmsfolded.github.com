Spoilers herein.

At one point, it seemed Hollywood would jump out of its skin with self-reference. You can  see it here better than anywhere. B movies are after all like political gaffs, when you'd say the  truth by accident because you're not paying enough attention.

This is a trivial story, what with blonds stuck in trash cans, bad guys grabbing and clunking  in the dark, stolen diamonds, cat jumpings, and (I'm not joking) the old manikin that gets  stuck and follows the girl.

But see the extremely clever folding: This is a movie about making movies. It is a story with  pictures about people who write stories and take pictures. And it is done with a blending of  the worlds that is nearly surreal. If it weren't intended to be cheap timewasting filler, you  might see it as art.

Spoilers herein.

Just because this is aimed at 13 year old boys, that it has poor production values and laughable acting doesn't mean it is without intelligence.

There are a few books, TeeVee shows and films (even role-playing games) whose appeal lies not in what is seen but in the mechanics and details of the world behind what is seen.

This is usually the domain of science fiction and fantasy. We enthusiasts will gladly put up with a poor window into a world if that new world transports with a cosmology that appeals. Each new episode adds information, and with each new piece, the viewer becomes addicted to greater discovery.

(Soap operas and baseball exploit a similar dynamic concerned with just tracking the story of the moment. History is essential, but there is no underlying science to be discovered.)

The Highlander world is a pretty interesting one because it leverages some Celtic magic that wonderfully differs from the Mediterranean traditions which power Western thought. That Celtic tradition has a recent story where Londoners around 1900 deliberately worked to reinvent German rosicrucianism into Celtic magic. Highlander adopts themes from this Order of the Golden Dawn.

Now to this film and its versions. It is not bad simply because it has bad acting and horrible production values, nor even the stupid story. All had that. What this film does is break the rules, transgress the pact with the viewers who create the world. Once the logic of the cosmology is broken, this band of monks is betrayed. End of world.

There is an ethical line that is crossed when this happens. I wonder what the implications are: tolerance for doublespeaking politicians and evangelists, or a heightened sense of truth?

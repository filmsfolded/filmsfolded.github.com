Spoilers herein.

Films decay. Most films will. And most of this will too, and much faster than usual because we'll tire of effects soon. But for a very long time, I suspect this film will be viewed only because it has Julianne in it.

It is junk (formulaic rectal humor), but she fills every scene she's in even though all she's asked is to be a cartoon. All that work on multidimensional projection she did for Vanya surely shows.

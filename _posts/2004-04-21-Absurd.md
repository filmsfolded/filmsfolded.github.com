Spoilers herein.

The rather amazing influence of Jess Franco has tempted me to dive into similar  eurotrash in search of interesting tidbits.

The story this time out is as flat as its presentation: some sort of Frankenstein  experiment has created a monster. Several sadistic killings later he is beheaded by a  bedridden girlie. No prurient elements.

But look a little deeper for creepiness. This is an Italian production, which means it is  rooted in Catholicism. The monster and the priest chasing it are from Greece, where the  orthodox megasect offshoot of the Roman religion is strong. Other than organizational  differences, the main discriminator is in the idols that have infiltrated.

On the Roman side it is guilt, on the Greek side it is golem-like icons. Put the two  together and you have something like this: innocents martyred, guilty parents, saint-like  rescues. Think I'm kidding? How similar to the famous Italian paintings of Salome is that  final scene?

And where does that 'coagulates fast' come from? Guess.

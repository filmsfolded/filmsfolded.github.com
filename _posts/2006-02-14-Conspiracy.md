Every film is the result of a meeting of muses, perhaps not in "real" space but certainly in virtual space.

These muses will represent the various worlds the film must master, or at least have an existence in. The unanimous active collaboration of all these muses is important and it is essential that at least a few can fly.

In this case, we have a situation with a moral shape given a historical shape in an event. We wish to have cinematic, dialog, acting, and cinematic shapes in the mechanics of the production. And wish (especially the dialog) to raise issues that have philosophical and legal shapes.

That's eight muses by my count, all sitting around an Olympian table. Each is selfish. Each represents values that may compromise or negate the shapes desired by the others. Other projects will have slightly different muses, some with different powers, but the dynamics are the same for every film.

In "12 Angry Men" those muses were able to come to some consensus by a process I imagine to very like the film itself. That film is marvelously balanced with strong shapes in all the key areas and is therefore the very best of that year.

The meeting of muses for this film was very much like the film itself, a jackbooted steamroller of predecisions. You get snippets of shapes in the film: there is an interesting fragment of the legal issue. The idea here was not necessary whether to eliminate Jews or not, but whether to fabricate an executable legal framework or not.

There are interesting glimpses of what Branaugh and Tucci might have brought. (But that may not have been so great a loss; best not to let actors run roughshod over the other shapes.) And a few other muses mutter here or there.

No, everything is suborned to the "dramatic" shape and a particularly simple, TeeVee oriented one at that. "Shindler's List" was similarly crushed by the imposition of a purely cinematic shape. We are supposed to fill in the blanks of the missing shapes because of the mere import of the subject.

Well, it worked for Spielberg -- many think it a good film. But it actually did not in Shindler's, nor in this case. Rampant fundamentalism is a flaw everywhere when imposed by thugs: in politics today and yesterday. And in the creation of art also.

This was as finely oiled as Eichmann's mechanics, but even during the meeting I felt I needed some air.

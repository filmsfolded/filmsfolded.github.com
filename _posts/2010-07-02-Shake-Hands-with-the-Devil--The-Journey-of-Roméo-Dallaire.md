This comes to me as recommended for two reasons. One is that I will be going to do something in Rwanda, and am trying to find out as much as I can. The other is that I am deep into an experience with documentaries, trying to understand the form.

The background: small UN peacekeeping force is sent to Rwanda to monitor a treaty settling a civil war. Shortly after getting there, things explode. Between 800,000 and 900,000 of the minority are killed in three months, mostly by kids with machetes protected by the military. Another 100,000 perish in the camps and aftermath. The trouble originated with Belgian/French rulers decades ago, with the French equipping the murderers until the last moment knowing their intent.

But we had UN troops on the ground who easily -- easily -- could have prevented the genocide, but for French and Belgian demands that they stand down and basically watch (after getting the Europeans out). The most frustrated, haunted man in the world that year was the general in command of the toothless UN mission. He ran himself nuts with trying to get the world to pay attention. The genocide only ended with the victory of the rebel army. On return home, this general tried drinking and suicide, ultimately stabilizing.

The documentary is his return to Rwanda ten year after the genocide. He is one of the easiest screen personalities to know that I have encountered. We walk with him as he encounters his demons, some of which are shown from footage of the disaster and him in it, harried but determined.

The business about evil matters here. This is not some made up cosmology. The General is a deeply religious man, a Quebecer, which is to say he is a Roman Catholic of that particular French strain that holds strong abstractions about the celestial battle of good and evil. Evil on Earth had the possibility of reality for him. He would have been aware of the (French- speaking) Belgian atrocities in Congo and Rwanda and how they were supported by the French-led Catholics. When the genocide began, he witnessed priests assisting and the Pope frustrating outside involvement.

When he left that ruined country, what he knew was that he had encountered the devil face to face, had lost, and he now bore the responsibility for a million cruel needless deaths. He speaks of shaking hands with men he knew to be possessed. Now, on his return, he encounters his own devils and doubts while fearing that the dark master would reappear. His patient wife is with him, seeing the land for the first time.

We follow this man, his feet, his mind and his soul. We hear the horror and guilt, all the while seeing him be celebrated by those he knew. When he stands in a spot and speaks of what he cannot wash from his eyes, we see it as well, an inner cinema. We cannot possibly feel what he does, but the reality of a devil that can ambush -- this strikes a deeper fear than any fictional horror movie can

The history of cinema is an odd tangle, and when you go back through old movies what you are seeing is a jumble of armies of influence, frozen in time as a history of emergent forces. Some win, some lose. Some adapt to survive.

The viewing public has its needs, its stories that it wishes to have reinforced. The market pull in most cases isn't a need to be amused, rather to be reinforced. The push is the ability to sell the most, the very most tickets, so the broadest strokes only.

That makes these dead armies easy to interpret.

When film was new, it had many identities that it could have adopted. If you go back and look at the early projects, you'll see possibilities that continue traditions from other arts: dance, photography (itself newish), painting, literature, and surely theater -- continuing the few well defined theatrical traditions.

Along came D W Griffith and he swept all the possibilities to the side but one. Since then, its been a struggle for some of the more clever notions to come back. I study one collection of those "other" traditions.

The Griffith notion was to alternate (not quite "combine") between stage drama which involved simple stories and grand sweeps of outside action. The stage dramas had to be simple, usually placed and shot the same way they would appear in the theater. Usually it was a love or revenge story. The outside bits were unique to cinema.

This was not a good thing in my opinion, this suppression of the more powerful possibilities of film. The Griffith notion relies on the stage bits to provide a narrative and the grand sweeps to amplify elements of that narrative.

C B deMille continued this notion in talkies. He's the enemy of intelligent cinema and because so many political/religious decisions are based on what's stirred up, he's responsible for huge errors in society.

This may be the most interesting example of this river of influence.

Its religion, politics, love and ironic folding in one package.

The big sweep is that corrupt political power is bad for true goodness. Remember that this is toward the McCarthy era in US politics where evil communist dictatorships were threatening the Christian American way. (Compare this to "Birth of a Nation.") That allows for a cinematic sweep. Today, usually the sweep is used to "show" human emotions. Chinese filmmakers in particular like to show individual tensions by showing similar tensions in society, write large. This is reversed, a rather childish romance is included to annotate the grand sweep rather than the other way around.

Two interesting things.

The first is the very real presence that movies create in real life. Regardless of where you stand in matters of faith, its plain to anyone that the actual images and values come to us through media, and so far as religion that means film images. DeMille himself was Jew but he understood how to milk the religious imagination. Hollywood invented the robes and sandals that every Sunday School kid encounters in drawings. Hollywood invented the shape of the score many folks associate with heaven.

And here, here it is. Spirtuality invented.

The second interesting thing is how this folds back on itself. The whole thing exists to set up the events at the end: a show for Roman citizens in the Coleseum at the end. Its an odd ambiguity. We are told that this show is perverted and the people for whom it is created are of the devil, opposed to everything good we are shown. Yet the very reason this movie exists is so we can gawk at people being torn apart.

The effects are laughable by today's standards. But in their day they were spectacularly brutal. The movie was made so we could revel in that brutality and get precisely the same reward the Roman viewers do.

More, that carries over to the love story setup: we are presented with two women, the holy one and the privileged slut. All the plot points are directed toward artificial events so we can see the slut, bathing in her sexuality not on our terms, but hers. A nude bath is created only for us to gawk as Romans.

There are many teen movies today that poke fun at stupid teens that have certain qualities then depend on those same qualities to get laughs (and admission dollars). But this is an extreme -- or was until Mel Gibson. It defines religious image and value in a way that absolutely undermines it. Absolutely.

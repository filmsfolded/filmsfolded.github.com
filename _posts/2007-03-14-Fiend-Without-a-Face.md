There's a scene in this where the colonel calls the nuclear power plant and asks the engineer for more power. He all but says "if I give you any more power Jim, it'll blow!" Later we get: "I'm a doctor, not a detective!" It features a fellow with a heavy Scots accent. Gene Roddenberry must have seen this.

This story has a whole lotta elements: nuclear power, defense technology (in the form of high tech radar and planes), those pesky rooskies, telepathy, monsters, god-like creation supported by lightning, and "sibonetics." Our heroes are locked in a house with boarded up windows as the "mind zombies" attack.

You'll have to judge for yourselves whether it matches what you need for pleasure, but it surely influenced scifi and monster pictures that followed.

The thing I like about these is how they portray the mad scientist. Even in those days when the military was king, the uniformed guys didn't have the brains. Those reside in white-coated old men, here clearly contrasted with the soldiers and the local townspeople -- particularly the local doctor. Doctors are often the smart people in town in movies (almost never lawyers), so this is significant.

In this case, they follow the "Forbidden Planet" template. The doctor is an adventurer, someone addicted to creation, not discovery. A real scientist would typically be more interested in understanding things; movie mad scientists are more interested in creating things without necessarily understanding them. There are probably two reasons for this in the 50's.

The first is the obvious: understanding, comprehension, insight, are not very cinematic, at least using the techniques available. The second is equally obvious: "science" had created the bomb (about which we are reminded here constantly) and the public believed that this was a rushed creation without "understanding" because understanding was related to control and we obviously did not control the bomb.

As with most things cinematic, conventions are set in their time, reflecting their time. And then those conventions persist. Just as you can see some stylistic elements of this in later projects like "Star Trek," you'll surely see this notion of a mad, creative scientist echoing in modern films.

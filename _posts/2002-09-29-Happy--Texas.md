Spoilers herein.

Some 'bad guys' come to town and pretend to be something else. That's the level of most projects with the jokes all built around the duplicity. This is a horrid little film that depends on Zahn's several histrionics, but it has one quirk in that it builds a third level: the little girls' performance. So here we have a triple layer of play: the actors playing characters who are actors who teach little girls to be actors as well.

It is easy to make a movie. Anyone can do it.

To judge from experience, it is harder to make an endearing or engaging one. But there are enough of these as well. This is one. 

But as with making a baby, it is easy enough to make one that when you first meet it you fall in love with how endearing and guileless it is. But to give it shape and depth is another thing.

This IS endearing and if that is what you like, I suggest you seek it out.

But the contract we have is to have the filmmaker take us somewhere once they have us by our grins and tears. Lets hope this filmmaker takes advantage of us next time.

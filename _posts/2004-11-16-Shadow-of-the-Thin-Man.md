Spoilers herein.

There's something of a miracle at work here. This consists of amazing characters, some of the very best in movieland. By this film, we already know the setup: the dog, the booze, the prodding wife, and the fact that Nick knows everyone in town.

I believe the magic of Hammett was that the created stories that weren't just incidental, but integral to the lives of these attractive weirdos. This is the first of the series to not be based on a Hammett story. So we get characters that are a little more colorful and a story that almost is background noise.

Nonetheless, Van Dyke - nearing his suicide - falls off his usually crisp rhythm. Everything is off in the pacing, from completely unnecessary and unfunny sequences (the carousel) to an amazingly hackneyed bar fight scene, except in a restaurant. Consequently, the snappy delivery of the dialog in the original is off. The words are there, but no humor.

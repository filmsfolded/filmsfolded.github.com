Spoilers herein.

I watched this because of Juliet Lewis. Her acting style fascinates me: she is a vocal stylist rather than a full body actress, and her characters are created from the modulating of dialects. That's why she seeks out lowlife and southern parts, I think.

'Gilbert Grape' and 'Kalifornia' were strong vehicles for her and it was interesting to see her work her voice. Even "Killers" and "4th Floor." This movie borrows from both: retarded southern lowlifes, but with a Hallmark, rosey glow. The story itself is offensively trite, but I was surprised how well cast it was: the four female leads all were of this same school of practiced voices.

I 'watched' it again with only the sound. It was not only improved, but I became more impressed with Ms Lewis. The director has something to be ashamed of so far as the subject matter, but he surely had some interesting insight into how to assemble a cast with consonant acting styles.

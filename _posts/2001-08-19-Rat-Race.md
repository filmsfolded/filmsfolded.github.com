Spoilers herein.

Two interesting things about this.

I am a strong believer in there being seven types of people. Or rather that human group dynamics define seven stereotypes around which people invent themselves. Here's a test to see which you are. There are seven types of comedy here: the six competitors/teams, and the betters. The strategy with films like this is to shuffle between types of comedy to keep the pace moving. The full range of comedy cannot be accommodated, but there are seven different types here. Same as Mad, Mad.

My own favorite is Cuba and his Lucies, including the explanation of why he needed the uniform and leading up to the big W: 'You wuined our wacation.' Its because it is mildly self-referential: a busload of comic impersonators -- and because Gooding's acting is an odd take on comedy. He plays it straight, but straight in a dizzy world where everything is pushed into Wiley Coyote territory (just like Lucy): his comedic acting is noncomic acting pushed past the limit. In a real sense, he is goofing (in a friendly way I'm sure) on the professional comics. The only two old pros here: Goldberg and Cleese, are the least funny of the bunch, which just emphasizes the point.

The other interesting thing for me was the producer's icon for the new Fireworks productions (new to film anyway). These are the often annoying snippets that are shown before you start to get your money's worth, being a sort of letterhead of sponsoring organizations.

They are representative of that sponsor, their approach to quality and often some philosophy about the business. Dreamworks is one everyone knows: a combination of Normal Rockwell and mystical magic, strictly visual. Some of the others are absolutely dreadful. These are like a printer's brochure, or an architect's office -- they should be done well.

This one is done well. It is visually stunning and gets the message across cleanly and quickly. There is a fireworks effect done with bombs punctuating 'ordinary' bursts. The bombs establish a cadence long enough for it to register on your senses. Then it smoothly accelerates in a way you can track. Then it outpaces your ability to recognize a pattern and breaks into seeming chaos. (Developed by BoomBoom Bamboni if I have it right.) Thrilling, because you know it was all planned, that it affected you through that plan, but that you couldn't comprehend the order of it all. This is conveyed in the Fireworks clip in about ten seconds. Fireworks is a group to watch.

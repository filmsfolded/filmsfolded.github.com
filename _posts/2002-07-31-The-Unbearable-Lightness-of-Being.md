Spoilers herein.

This film is a failure, but one I really like because they tried to do something ambitious. The book was steeped in Eastern Europeanisms, an intimate linkage of interlocking clockworks: political, artistic, erotic. The book is highly introspective: lot's of glosses into selfaware annotations on itself. Sabina's art (and the fabric of the place), Tereza's photographs (and the films of the invasion) are merely the keystones for promiscuous philosophy.

The sexual promiscuity is only the landscape for these explorations. But here, the manifold is linearized. It really is about sex in the context of power. All the meandering philosophizing is strained out. In its place are very serious efforts to _look_ Czech. It is a thin substitute.

We have many (many!) of the best actors in the world in the traditional, non-ironic, non-layered tradition. So the thing is transformed into something, well more kitsch. But taken on its own terms, simply, it is lovely, just because there is a deliberate European flavor. The mix of American goals and European execution evokes charm, especially when we are turned over to these remarkable women.

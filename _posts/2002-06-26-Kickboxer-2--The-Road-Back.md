Spoilers herein.

This is porn. Fight pictures are based on perversions, pure and simple. The most common are cloaked in revenge, so the setup has to be something so vile, so unfair that we applaud the violent comeuppance of the villain.

This is a completely formulaic picture, so we spend much time discovering how kind and mild is our hero. Then we encounter the evil things done to him and friends because of him. And finally we have justice.

It is too easy to criticize this particular film -- for these to work, they have to be bad in terms of acting and such. So let's go further and say that the genre itself is just the sort of vile offense against use that is depicted.

I'm a gentle soul.  But the industry keeps throwing these things at me, and worse at the whole world:

--  many of whom think the US is first and foremost like this

--  many of whom think of themselves as honorable souls (who doesn't?) and worthy of violent retribution

Do we need this stuff in our lives?

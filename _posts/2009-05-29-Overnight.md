I have to admit that I liked "Boondock Saints." I liked it because it was a Tarintino without the pretense that because you can engineer violent irony, you can make it engaging. I liked it because I knew that every actor was making up everything with no guidance. I liked it because it was a story of a mess that driven by the mechanics of messness, and that mechanics was visible as the point.

Now here, we have the equivalent of "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse." Except this time the genius at the center is a moron who thinks he is a genius. There is a complete contrast from the attractive, nonsensical mess of "Boondock" and the grinding inevitable sense of this: jerk gets his due. It is simply a matter of watching the predictable grind through, with the only mildly interesting elements being a small glimpse into the movie business world. 

More interesting is the fact that we are watching something. We know that the band deal went sour. We know the movie deal did too. The documentary documents that. But it does not document itself. It turns out that the making of it was part of the deal, first supported out of pride and then out of sheer desperation for some money. The omission of the thing from the thing is glaring, and quite hypnotic.

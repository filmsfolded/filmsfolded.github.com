I was for some time in this business, so know how goofy some of the science is. And the acting is on the cheesy side as you would expect. And I understand that the many elements of the truth have been stretched quite a bit, both by the original participants and the filmmakers.

But there are some things about this are very appealing. For one thing, there isn't the ordinary fantasy of cool computer graphics that movies like to pawn off on the unwitting; its pretty much scrolling text, as it is in the real world.

What's really missing is the sense of community that all the gangs in this drama have in real life. Moving ahead for all the gangs is a game that encompasses life, something that is played down here as the mano a mano angle is enhanced.

I did like a couple things: Amanda Peet has a non-formulaic role and does well with it. Some of the tensionbuilding devices were effective: the gloom, the dutching, the thunder. And it was good that to some extent they showed the real cracker game: it is not so much a game of genius or ingenuity, but of the con.

Someday, someone will make a movie that really does exploit the mathematics of elite computer types. These guys tend not to be hackers: programmers are the secretaries of the trade. I'm talking about the few score artists who exist, mostly in obscure corners.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 3 -- Has some interesting elements.

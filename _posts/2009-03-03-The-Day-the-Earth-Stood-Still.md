As far as I can tell, the only substantial change that was intended had to do with the robot. In the original, this was a guy in a cardboard suit with a red light that was enhanced in what we now call postproduction. 

Here it is a giant with roughly the same shape and initial behavior. But instead of him stomping about, lasering things retail, here he becomes an infinite and growing swarm of nanowasps.

I rather liked the idea, working in the field myself. The idea appeals, but not the effect or the rendering. Oh, you should know that the movie fails for ordinary reasons that you can learn elsewhere, but this is an interesting failure.

Clever nanotech systems do not borrow their behavior from conventional metaphors. What we have here are insects -- definitely not microscopic, because we actually see them in various sizes, usually about 1/8 to a quarter inch. These bugs behave like regular bugs or at least as we would imagine them. Its a sort of locust plague, except instead of erasing crops, they erase manufactured artifacts, presumably making more of themselves from the material (because nothing is left).

Thinking of this potentially wonderful machinery in this blunt, stupid way makes on wonder if we are worth saving.

An imaginative nanoswarm would not be small elements with wings that move in formation like birds. It would be dust that swarms in magnetic vortices, propelled by qubit anticipation. Jees.

The one unanticipated change from the original is the loss of this scene. In the original, the space fellow has been shot, indicating that we are dolts. The next day, coming from the hospital room, two doctors discuss the miraculous healing of the wound. They gather next to each other and remark on all the medical knowledge this advanced civilization must have that we do not. These doctors are smoking.

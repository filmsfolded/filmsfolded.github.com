A simple, theatrical concept done well as other comments attest.

The key device here is that women come in types. Only if you accept that can you buy the idea that left alone a certain mix of types will each blossom. Here, we have the Madonna (impressed on us rather bluntly) the honest nervous airhead, the pompous old hasbeen and the slut. Various stereo/archetypical men parade through as well.

I liked this film, but it left me with two memorychildren:

--the first is honest puzzlement over whether I have to type a woman to appreciate her in art.

--the second is what happens to lovely spoiled Caroline when the movie ends. It makes her Palerma highclass callgirl role in 8 1/2 women so much richer. That also is a film about typing women, and she plays the same type. Also appealing in the role.

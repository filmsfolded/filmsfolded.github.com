Spoilers herein.

Sometimes the layers of construction of a film are all too obvious. We have a core of the  interesting world or air traffic control, based on a magazine article. Overlain on that is  the almost obligatory love triangle, here a square. And on top of THAT, we have some  new age Zen competitiveness (replete with three-D internal visualization), and some  scriptdoctored humor.

Thrown into the mix are some able actors and a director who is usually pretty good with  layers.

That wasn't enough to make this work for me when it came out. But since then, there  have been a couple new layers added.

The first is 9-11. Seeing so many references to planes, plane crashes, terrorist bombs  and even the World Trade Center really etches depth into what was earlier thin metaphor.  The second new layer is no less profound. We see familiar faces and know what has  happened to them since.

Billy Bob and Angeline have entered and left a marriage not entirely unlike that they play.  The director went on to produce Cusack's terrific, reflexive 'High Fidelity.' Billy Bob wrote  a part for Cate next year, where she played his mother (and where she met Ribisi which  produced the hypnotizing 'Heaven'). And the following year she and BB finally got it right  with 'Bandits,' similar in many ways to this.

Meanwhile, she claims Cusack as her third great love, whatever that means.

New layers meld with the old to make this an interesting experience now.

I was planning a comment about De Palma's deft eye. I've mentioned it elsewhere, but this is the film of his most concerned with film-making as an element of the story.

However, in true De Palma fashion, I'll ask you to imagine what I might have said while I focus on something else: Nancy Allen.

This is my 430th or so IMDb comment, but the first for which I solicited MessageBoard help. My theory was that sex ruins vision. It clearly did in this case. Film often presents dreadful performances, but rarely when some other element is top flight.

But my IMDb comrades gave many examples of off-set sex enhancing the result (Mamet-Pidgeon excepted). That raises an even more interesting question: Here is De Palma who presumably encountered many of the world's most beautiful; and seductive women in his work and leisure. Yet the one that beguiled him was Nancy. She must have been extraordinary in person.

I was lucky. I came to this knowing nothing about it. For some odd reason, I had avoided the press and those trailers that tell you the whole story.

As a result, I was able to simply flow with the story, the way the writer intended, not knowing what was coming next. I had the full mystery, that complex of mysteries that were set out for us. I found the writing amazingly deep. Sure, there are what would be called deep themes: love, redemption and both in novel forms. But its the way the thing is unfolded for us that I find so special. 

Will Smith does not annoy me. He's a sort of everyman token, like Jimmy Stewart, or better: Fred MacMurray. He does well enough. His true value here was in discovering the story and assembling the team, a competent enough team. The story is by itself enough for me to recommend this to you.

The cinematic treatment is something else though. It could have been magnificent. It could have been eviscerating; it could have encircled your heart. There were lots of hooks, written in simply for the camera. That business with the jellyfish is a visual setup, smoky and translucent. The concept of the auditor, who "sees through." the idea of the communication (via texting) that leads to disaster -- the message gone wrong. The idea of love as a bodily giving. The notion of brotherhood allowed via waiting outside.

These are the things that cinema was invented for. It has been ready for material like this for eons. Someone needs to transplant this in a stronger body. Someone needs to be the embossed printer.

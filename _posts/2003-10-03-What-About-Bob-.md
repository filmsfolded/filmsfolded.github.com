Spoilers herein.

Actors have a few choices to make that are life altering. One of these is to decide which  of the small number of positions they will take on just what an actor is.

Many of these can be aligned from the extremes of 'instrument' to 'composer.' The  'instrument actors' are those who believe their job is to be an interpreter of whatever art  has been created before they arrive on the scene.

Then, in regular quanta, we have discrete types of actors who add something of  themselves, sometimes emotional 'truth' (in lessor actors: passion disguised as truth).

Toward the far extreme are actors who put themselves somewhere between a performing  instrument and a creator. The simplest of these are that actors who say; 'this is me, and  this is the character and you know that I know that you know I'm just playing a part...'  Usually, these are comedians, brought in to enliven an otherwise dead vehicle.

But sometimes we get an actor who has made the very risky choice of always taking that  in-between space, the space between the movie and us, and using it to create a dialog  quite apart from the story in the movie. Bill Murray - since 'Groundhog' - has made  this choice, and developed some tools to pull it off.

That's why Wes Anderson, and other filmmakers who play with that space (Jarmusch,  Coppola) like him so much.

That's why he was cast as Polonius in the radical 'Hamlet' of 2000. And that's why he's  in this trifle. The form is a conventional one: unlikely interloper seeds wisdom. But the  business about analysis gives Bill his lever to have that analytic hidden dialog with us.

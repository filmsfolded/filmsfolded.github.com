Spoilers herein.

"Fargo" without the go, "Albino Alligator" without the wrinkles, "The Gardener" without  Angie, "Invisible Man" made visible, "Insomnia" without the light and most of all, "Twin  Peaks" with only one peak.

McDowell has built a career of his role in "Clockwork Orange:" a demented brilliance of  character.

It is possible to make an interesting film like this. All of the above have something worth  watching. But you cannot do it with voiceovers.

All three of the murdered women were or became redheads.

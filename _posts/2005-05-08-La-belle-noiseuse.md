I recommend this little film to you. It is an interesting confluence of two threads.

One of these is the French New Wave itself. New Wave films are -- were -- stories combined with essays about film-making and associated matters. Nearly all these guys were film commentors before becoming filmmakers. The only problem was that the ideas about film weren't particularly deep or useful. And the merger of metastory with story was often clumsy. 

Now comes a film from one of these fellows, someone eschewed by the group and not particularly interesting in the past. But he has set a very clever but simple construction to merge the film with a story about film (here tokenized as a painting). "In painting, what is said doesn't count."

The slant is successful because it is personal and dangerous and is about personal and dangerous things, which brings us to the second thread: movies about some other deep enterprise. Often this class is about painting, but as likely we have mathematics, music, writing and dance. A touchstone of such movies is the genius and his or her struggles with the laws and forms of the world they've entered.

The interesting thing about these films is how little they actually convey about that world. Movies about mathematics -- movies like "Pi" or "A Beautiful Mind" or "Good Will Hunting" -- are particular offenders. They don't seem to have ever understood the world in the first place, much less found successful cinematic means to transport the uninitiated.

But movies about the arts have a keen trap: showing the art and its creation or performance. Thus, in "Hilary and Jackie" we get the cellist sawing away in appropriate trance. In "Pollack" we see energetic dripping. In "Girl with a Pearl Earring" we see serious furrowed brow. But in terms of the story, we might as well be watching someone with a banal passion, a boxer, say. 

There's nothing about the art, no entry into the world. All we see are actors acting tortured or otherwise jostled by the art, but never the art itself. Never do we leave our world and enter theirs. In terms of painting movies, that's true of "Pollack," "Earring," "Sirens," and "Stealing Beauty." "Maze" is a film about Tourette's done in a Tourette's style. "Draughtsman's Contract" is extraordinary in merging the drawing with what's drawn, but even it avoids tourism into the mind of the artist.

Not so here. In this case, there's lots of talk, but it is exposition in the service of helping us enter the world of the painter and his model. We do enter that world. We see art being developed and the art isn't just filler, the artifacts act. The initial sketches are by a tentative, lost artist and are indeed tentative and lost. As the thing develops, we see the sketches change accordingly. We see many of them being made in an extraordinary mix of the actor's hand and that of a superb painter.

Put these two threads together and you have -- finally -- the culmination of French New Wave: a bona fide film that stands on its own merits that is also a film about the creative process of making a film. It works because we actually stand by the side of the painter/ filmmaker. We actually see the actress/model as she hesitantly shows up, gets engaged, and ultimately has her engagement mature above her reach.

This is "Day for Night" done right.

And here's the amazing dramatic device: we never see the painting. We see it secreted instead. At the end, in good New Wave fashion, the inner story is made to disappear as the metastory engulfs the finale.

This has perhaps the best use of sharp sound in any film. 

The story itself, for those interested, is centered on Jane Birkin's character, though most of the attention focuses on the painter and his (new) model. Birkin plays the painter's wife and former model. She captured his interest as a model and he began a masterpiece titled the same as this movie. He abandoned it because he knew he would destroy her soul if he finished it and he would rather have her love than continue as a painter. So he says and we believe them both.

At some point near this decision, she (Birkin) had an affair with the dealer/patron. He still loves her dearly and prompts the painter to get reinvolved with the project. His involvement is complex, but not nearly as much as Birkin's, who is employed literally as a taxidermist and as preserver of the aging, lost painter.

He re-enters the world of decomposition of surfaces and elements. She does too, with more art.

National intellectual identities are real, real enough to create pockets of art. Each pocket reflects different notions about how the world is put together. So when we pick DVDs from the shelves, we are doing more than picking flavors for a meal, we instead pick the stuff out of which you can construct your cosmos.

Movies make it easy, especially 30 year old European films.

From France, we have the notion that movies are artifacts of the film-making process and little else. So when you see a movie, the role of the story is to annotate all the other stuff, the brushstrokes. One, very nice technique is to construct a scene of different takes and angles of the "re-enactment" of that scene. An example I just saw with this film: the aftersex scene in "Shoot the Piano Player" has about two dozen individual one or two second shots of the lovers in bed, near-asleep. The scenes are jumbled from what may have been scores of takes. Different positions, angles, lighting. Resnais would do it with different beds and clothes. A collage of images that suggest a larger whole than what anyone could see.

Italians go the other way. Reality is composed of solid gold threads that cameras can capture. The art in this is the elegance and cleanliness of the way reality is exposed. It isn't about brushstrokes -- there need be no indication of the capture at all.

Spaniards (including especially the influences in the colonies) have it quite a bit differently. The world is synthetic, many layers ascending to magical plasticity. These are spun by souls in the worlds in collaboration with other souls looking at those worlds, Confusion between those groups is part of the game.

Now, along come the Japanese and HKers. If you are not rooted in a cosmology and you just want to be stylish, you'll borrow from all of these without regard to how they fit together. The world is one of unordered chaos of undirected gods with a wrapper of cool postures.

This movie is extraordinary. It takes chances with each of the three traditions I note, pushing them a bit farther than the priests of each would likely do. Some of the notions are striking, the fragmented cuts: different parts of scenes, overlapping women and intents, guns and butterflies, implied and explicit scents.

A young man with an appreciation of what he had went wild in a perfumery and fell in love with the smells instead of the woman they might have enhanced.

So, friends. Living in these at least gives you opportunity to visit different universes. If you choose to stay in this one, you'll live with all shell, nothing but posture, the illusion of depth only. Much has been made that Jarmusch quoted things from this. Its worth experiencing Jarmusch (especially "Ghost Dog") as a way of understanding how he deals with the problem of chaos. He goes another layer, giving only the illusion of emptiness but implying something else. His chaos is elevated to a matter of style itself, with something inside. What is it for Jarmusch? Something made of all those three, but woven at the roots rather than the billboards. Noir created by its puppets.

If you can stand it, and if you can extricate yourself when the time comes, this can be fun. But if you want the real thing, go to "Chungking Express" or its surrounding projects.

Spoilers herein.

You may actually like this film as what it was intended, a way of pleasantly spending time  with a disarmingly sincere girl, rich color and competent enough routines. But it is far  more likely that you will enjoy it as a metafilm: one that you can watch as something that  explicitly involves the era, the studio system, the place of women in society and as icons  on screen, and how our Ms Garland encounters all these.

Redheaded, at her lifetime, drugged thinnest and her most practiced sincerity, this is the  purest Judy.

The story is about corporate exploitation of women, and strangely IS the very same  thing. We have three groups: the whores at the saloon who battle the "waitresses" of the  restaurant for the attention of the town, which here seems to be entirely male except for  the two gangs of women. The waitresses serve up their meat allegorically, act more coyly  but otherwise -- we are assured at the end -- the difference is a matter of style. Both  have extreme costumes. Both perform. Both are headed by redheads, one dark and deep,  the other light and presumably vacuous.

Then we have the actresses as actresses, similarly used. This was a couple years before  she started to get critical and pathologically break down. It is, in fact in her most  compliant and productive state, where the bosses were draining as much and as fast as  they could.

This is as early as you are likely to see another interesting woman, Cyd Charisse. Here,  one can see her extraordinary poise. Her naturally red hair is darkened.

Spoilers herein.

McCartney as a writer is one of the most influential artists of the century. I mean this in spite of the vulgar disguise which he himself believes.

He is highly intuitive and is best when he just taps his visions without trying to understand too much about it. His inspirations are Jarry, Matisse and the early Victorian Kabbalists. As with them, he taps ley lines of the collective soul, in his case enabled by a continuously drugged state. He is at his best when he thinks it doesn't matter so much and is just fun. Then some profound stuff appears.

But he is his own worst enemy when he tries to explain, even understand himself, and especially so when attempting 'serious' music. Here we have the worst of both.

We have the Paul who believes we think he knows what his art is all about and are anxious to hear what he says. And we have the art itself which is strained in both senses. It is of mild interest if you are interested in how he generally thinks of odyssian sagas. Otherwise, after seeing this, you'll have to work to re-appreciate Paul's real art.

Spoilers herein.

As with all Pedro Almodóvar's films, we have a flat, weakly humorous exploration of some sexual situation. And as with all his films, it misses being interesting or charming. That is, unless you do a little work to punch it up. My own method is to fabulate around the Spanish tradition within which he certainly belongs. (I really liked the Spanish reflexiveness in 'Lucía y el sexo.')

The raw material for the reflection is deliberately put there: it is a film about a film, where the merging of the two isn't obvious.

Marina is a strawberry blond porno actress with a sister-manager, Lola, and a drug problem. She is lovers with Pepe who lives in a grandly furnished apartment, adjacent to the smaller place he provides for her.  Lola and Pepe are pimps of a sort for show business and arrange for her to play in a film. It will be the last film of Máximo. All three are involved in the film: Máximo directs, Lola is the writer, Pepe is the art director, you the audience are the cinematographer. All are infatuated with her.

What we see is the movie that results from the various tugs from each of these. It starts out (well into the film after the madman is invented) with the 'reality' prefilming the final sequence. Máximo is being interviewed and the reporter sees an actor, Osvaldo, from real life a fat guy. We later see him in the 'movie' as a really well built guy. Marina is directed to act like the reporter when she sees her man. This is the first obvious indication that the film and the film within are to be merged.

'Midnight Phantom' is the movie being made, putting one's heart and genitals on the line. Marina and the phantom tussle with Marina left hanging. Then the real merger of film realities get shuffled. The mental patient, her drug problems (disguised as 'toothache'), her unfulfilled sexual desires, and the needs of her film 'managers' result in her being tied up/down, which rescues her from her rut.

Its driven home by the mental patient's talent as an artist who 'draws' the film -- a drawing of his comes to life to start the movie.

There is a particularly nice shot: after Rocky gets out of the  nuthouse/sexual prison, he is on the sidewalk in a long shot that flattens space like one of his animated drawings. A pretty redhead girl skating back and forth is rather poetic.

The self-reference is nearly out of reach as the film masquerades as a sexual comedy. I only know 'All About My Mother,' of his other films, but that's exactly the case there as well. This one has redheads.

I'm not the ideal audience for this, and you are likely not as well. It is a collage of images where each image in the small has universal connection, but the two great narrative strokes are situated in the time and place. You'll have to not only be aware of the great European repressive disasters of the 20th century, but be personally damaged by them as well.

Those two threads are entertaining to report at least. A Russian woman -- with an invisible crew -- moves a large boat down the Danube, she aloft at the bow as conquering Viking, a huge face of Lenin on the front. It is filled with candy and as she floats downriver Huck Finn- wise, she seduces and kills men and boys, adding the bodies to the cargo. This includes two indelible scenes. One is her seducing the candy-hypnotized boys. 

A second is wonderfully cinematic. She picks up a revolutionary deserter. In the boat is a deep hold of granular sugar, in which she likely buries her victims. She and the man make love in that sugar, sometimes completely burying them. She controls him completely, then he gets stabbed laughing, sated.

The other story has Canada's entry winning the contest for most beautifully formed hymen, winning marriage to the demented son of the world's richest woman. Her adventures are a sort of sexual perils of Pauline, with completely unusual situations. This includes getting publicly stuck in coitus with a movie star and being placed on a table in an active restaurant kitchen a la "Cook Thief, Lover."

At the end our virgin has a scene much like the sugar orgasm, but in her case she is nude, drenched in chocolate and drowns in orgasm.

Both of these women, communism and capitalism encapsulated in sexual bodies, end up in the same surreal asylum where we are exposed to one of the most negative surveys of societal bonding I have seen. This is the disgusting section you likely have heard about with the group celebrating rituals that seem depraved but that fit well within the political threads we have previously seen. These include historical footage about Nazis that are similar in tone.

Its close to the ideal that Greenaway espouses: pure image with no "story;" narrative made in the mind, the way vision is made in radio plays. And there is real effectiveness and some beauty in these lives, sugar in their deaths.

And at the very, very end, the children are reborn.

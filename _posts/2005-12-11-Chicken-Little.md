This starts with great promise. It has a self-referential start with a narrator (Garry Marshall doing Peter Falk) talking about uncreative beginnings. Then we see the hero's vision of a huge ball rolling through the town destroying everything. It merges with the similar ball in the first Indiana Jones, literally coming through the screen and out the door.

Then it is revealed as a vision. Then there follows notice that a movie is to be made of the stupid chicken. (We see it at the end.)

Disney is desperate to cover the loss of its relationship with Pixar, which singehandedly saved the company. Dreamworks seems incapable of doing something with legs. 

But Disney is ever more straightjacketed with formula and moralizing. That's what defines them.

So this movie is yet another disaster. But oh what a great opening.

You know, opening sequences have become something of an obsession in Hollywood. Often, they are financed independently and designed and added after the main film is set. You can see that here: the tone and cleverness of the opening is in a much higher class than the tepid movie.

Spoilers herein.

Few people appreciate how self-referential many filmmakers are. I believe a great many of them have a self-referential mentality regardless of the story, but for those people, you can find some projects were the story itself is self-referential. Here's one for Hitch.

It is set in a moviehouse. The central device is that a man pretends (even to his sad-eyed wife) to be  something he is not. In other words, he is an actor. Same with the detective. The central episode involves a bomb disguised as (hidden in) a film. It is a small observation, but combined with dozens of similar ones it gives insight into how the man thought apart from what he said.

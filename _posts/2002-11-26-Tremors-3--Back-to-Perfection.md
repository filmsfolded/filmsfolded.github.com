Spoilers herein.

'Tremors' was an interesting experiment is self-referential irony: making fun of the audience. It failed in the theaters was turned into a big hit on video. So the idea is to extend the franchise by pumping out a series of inexpensive videos. Along the way, you have to solve the problem of what is different from chapter to chapter. The distance between the first two was rather large. The first one pointed at 'Dune' and made fun. The second pointed to the first, and also evolved the creature. Now we are into steady state, where the formula will not change, only the monsters take on various comic forms. This is now into the Freddy Krueger model of sequels.

The sharp humor is lost. The first was cruel in how it abused its own audience for being stupid. The third pretends that all that highfalutin abuse was only a joke, and now sinks to taking itself seriously.

Science fiction started out in trouble, had a golden period and now is in trouble again.

This is from the starting period. As one of the inventors of the genre, Welles is to be blamed, I think.

Its because he started the notion of taking a scientific principle, and extrapolating it into the future in order to make a political point. 

The point here of course is that without books, man can and irrepressibly will go wrong. The movie elaborates beyond the book, as each stop along the river of time touches war, clearly stupid war, before we encounter the effects of the great war. It is simply social commentary. There is no science in the description of the machine. There is a sort of science of evolution in the outcome we see in the future.

But at the time, Darwin's theories were based on fittedness and constant improvement. This was later proved wrong, but Welles could not know. So the "evolution" that provides the basis of the future is bogus science.

Its simple social commentary taken to an abstract locale. 

Unfortunately, the book in its time was reported to have bite; the class system -- especially in the cities -- surely was as layered as this. Contemporary readers would have gotten some value out of it. A hundred years later, all we can focus on is what's missing. 45 years ago, the effects were impressive, but for my money, it merely copies "White Zombie," and not as well.

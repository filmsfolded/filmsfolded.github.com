Spoilers Herein.

What energy! Not only in the multiple roles of the filmmaker, but in the rush in which  images are served. 

I'm more a Tarkovsky than Eisenstein man, so this isn't really the kind of thing that  profoundly moves me. Tarkovskyites use the camera to explore and wonder, while  Eisensteiners rely on the composition of edits. No one glance means anything: the  assembly of images is all. The art is in the chop.

Rodriguez would have us believe that Leone is the template here, but Leone only  supplies style: the real template is a sort of turbulent journalism. That's why Depp is  placed amongst the Hispanic players: to be the eye that assembles. He brings his Hunter  Thompson sensibilities, or at least those he can invent in our minds.

Those eyes destroy, just like his tongue destroys the cook when it discovers excellence.  The key notion here is to create a world slightly more complex than what is shown so  that it all has to be assembled by guesses -- even down to the hundreds of incomplete  little bits that comprise the actions scenes.

Depp is already such an icon that he pull the whole center of a film from what we expect  to where the director wants to place it. Cool.

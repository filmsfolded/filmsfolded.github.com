Spoilers herein.

I have a minor hobby of watching bad movies and discerning elements in the story that reflect the dynamics that produce the bad movie in the first place. For instance, the film business is a civilization consisting of moneymaking ordinariness. But there still are some original talents that live, hidden in the wilds. These are genuine people. Actually, these are people that Barbara Hershey has encountered on projects. I think she sincerely wants to be one of them.

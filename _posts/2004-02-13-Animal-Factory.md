Spoilers herein.

Somewhere in the movie business there really are people who think that the more real a  film is, the better. And I mean literally real. We're not talking here about 'Godfather'  being the first mafia movie made by Italians, but a prison movie being made by cons  whose only goal is to show what it is like.

Well, that's not enough for me. In order to be real, you have to be false in very specific  ways so that the impression is of reality or better, the effect of the impression is the  same without the impression resembling the reality at all. And that's only if the reality is  something worth knowing about.

The DVD of this film contains the most puerile, vacuous commentary that I have  experienced - even more vacuous than hearing airhead Milla talk about 'Resident Evil.'  Basically, these are cons talking about 'yeah, the joint is JUST like dat.'

This is placed in the hands of two actors of the old school, actors who think only about  acting and not the grander plan. They have been effective in intelligent and powerful  projects. But here all they can do is go for the short drama, the actorly effects.

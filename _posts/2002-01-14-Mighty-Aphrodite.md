Spoilers herein.

Woody frustrates me, so much so that I never go out of my way to see his work. This even though 'Sweet and Lowdown' is on my short list of best films ever.

It is because he is that sort of a jazz musician who plays for himself; who relies on past masters, liberally quoting them as a mixture of homage and ironic self-reference; whose interests are broad and apparently undirected; and who is usually competent and seldom brilliant.

He doesn't really care about the audience, which is generally a good thing. But combined with his lack of genius, the end result is (except in the one case) not life-altering.

One could take the time to tease out his interests at the time: here Greek tragedy, there Russian expressionism, somewhere else noir. But that's just a parlour game.

The interesting thinking about this film for me comes from considering Bonham-Carter. I think she is an intelligent actress, certainly in the top dozen to follow. I particularly look for situations where the director does not provide strong guidance, as I believe to be the case with her here. Then you can see what the actor creates for herself. Mira has the simple character here, literally and in terms of difficulty. In contrast, Ms Helena has a pretty tough space to fill -- and this must be done in the background, playing off of Woody. And he insists on sucking up all the oxygen in a scene.

Viewing this a second time to just watch her, and one can see special ability: the ability to act to ones self. By this time, she was already living with Branagh who also has this character.

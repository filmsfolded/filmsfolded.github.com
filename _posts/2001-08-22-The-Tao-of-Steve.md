Spoilers herein.

This film did well at Sundance. I am increasingly convinced that Sundance is is not so much about the art of film, but the craft of amusing people. In other words, it reflects Redford's philosophy of deep thinking for the masses.

And Santa Fe rises to the challenge of being the new center of a particularly dumb edition of zen. My own theory is the influence of the Santa Fe Institute which deals with superficial effects at the threshold of (the religion of) math, but which has produced disappointing theory because their fundamental abstractions are so, well thin.

So here we have an actor in a fat suit, making a film about a guy whose hefty insights into human nature turn out to be so much thin tripe. Problem is that the film itself pretends to have hefty insights into human nature (by observing and goofing on him) -- and guess what, they turn out be thin as well.

We have had two stellar first films this year from writer/directors in 'Panic,' and 'Things you can tell by just...' The writing there was intelligent and actually insightful. Not so here. Your first clue should be that the 'Steve' of the title is McQueen, a fellow famously neurotic about his macho-ness and clearly not the self-aware personality sculptor referenced here. 

I suppose that the writers originally had a more metaphoric, talky approach in mind, perhaps as intelligently conceived as meals with Andre and Vanya. But as the discussion on the DVD so frankly shows, they continually watered it down with community theater values. They should have gone for the gold.

If you like the thin sentimentality and vapid emotionalism that characterizes this film, go see 'You can count on me' instead. It at least has better acting, a kid and everyone's teeth are clean.

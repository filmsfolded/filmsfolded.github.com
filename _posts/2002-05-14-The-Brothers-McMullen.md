Spoilers herein.

I suppose we should all celebrate when anyone is able to pull off a first production that doesn't embarrass.

But that is faint praise, and this is pretty thin stuff.

I could find no interesting element in it, save the self-reference. It is a first time screenplay about the creation of a firsttime screenplay. If not overly clever, that enfolding is especially natural here, using a subtext of the Church as the rules for plays. As with his screen avatar, Burns breaks the dogmatic rules, but only in ways that follow the popular convention.

The result is a miscarriage.

Spoilers herein.

I love self-referential scripts. This one was clearly written under pressure and delivered  before its time.

I'll leave for others to remark on how unappealing and incapable is Ms Hudson, even in  red hair. This writer takes chances in self-referential territory, and I greatly admired "Don  Juan Demarco." But there, he had two of the most interesting actors alive. Luke is coming  along, but nothing at all like the layered nuance of his brother, who is the "smart one."

There are a few instances where this story-that-is-the-film works. The best is of course  "French Lieutenants' Woman." But you may like "Misadventures of Margaret" which is not  only internally self-referential (moving in and out of a book being written) but externally  reference's Parker's amazing "House of Yes."

What studio genius put Kate Hudson next to Sophie Marceau? Sophie isn't the greatest,  but she IS vastly more attractive, knows how to exploit the camera (Kate hasn't a clue),  and is a major icon of just this sort of self-reference from "Beyond the Clouds."

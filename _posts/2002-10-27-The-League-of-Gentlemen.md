Spoilers herein.

I don't know when this genre first appeared -- the 'team heist' -- but this surely is the film that defined it as a genre.

A team of distinct characters. A genius planner. An incredibly elaborate plan. Lots of group dynamics, including humorous episodes. Some twists. As with a few other British genre-definers, this is as nearly perfect as one can get until the ending.

And as with many genres, the ending is malleable. The most recent I have seen is the 'Oceans' Eleven' remake, where the crooks get away.

Attenborough's acting style is never so plain as here. One can see his theatrical approach to film -- it stretches through all his directing through to 'Passage to India.'

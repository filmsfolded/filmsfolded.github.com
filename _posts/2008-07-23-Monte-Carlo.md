I seem to be spending time with films like this. If you take away the story (excepting the last five minutes) the characters, the dialog and the songs, this is a very fine movie. It has such deft technique that it can support a tone of light humor regardless of the main attraction.

This fellow was a master. Too bad he only made useless movies.

There is what I call a narrative fold. The story is that a nobleman disguises himself as a servant to get close to a penniless noblewoman. They fall in love. He is shunned because he is a commoner -- or perhaps because he has no money, it isn't clear. As all simple love stories do, this one must end with discovery and happiness. It occurs when the two at an opera where: guess what? The story is the same.

In that last few minutes, the songs and words on the stage of the opera overlap with those on the stage of the movie. Its nice.

The craft is enough for this.

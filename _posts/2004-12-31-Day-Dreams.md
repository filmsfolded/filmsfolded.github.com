I think we owe a lot to Keaton. He introduced lots of reflective conventions that seem normal today. He almost singlehandedly gave us the tools for seeing a character imagine something and them enter that imagined reality using the same film conventions the character exists in. 

The greatest example is "Sherlock Jr" that would come later. Two years earlier we have a similar, less severe setup. We see the imagined jobs he has, but each imagined world gets away from him just as in Sherlock. Its a terrific notion and the most sophisticated of the early folding techniques.

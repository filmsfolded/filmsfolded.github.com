If you want to dabble in the extreme, you have only two choices. Either you find a world or situation or character, and you introduce us to it and in the process, some extremity is invoked, either in the message or target. In this case, what you do is intrinsic to the project. These things work, often, because cinematic coherence is what you want and extremes can be exploited more easily than subtleties and ambiguities in the narrative.

Its the same with cinematic sex, I think. 

Or, you can simply go punk. Where extremes are the point. No reason, no creation of a world, no story other than the story of loud. These things never work for me. Its a statement that I wish not to participate in because what value there is goes to the sender.

This is simply a loud movie with no center. It has an energetic and committed actor. But ho hum. We always knew he and his buddies can emote dramatically. 

But there is an interesting thing here. "Ms. 45" was, I think an excellent movie. It had the same thing this does, a central character with explosive innards turned inside out. But it also conveyed a world. Where this one relies on the performance of ball players for reference, the earlier film situates itself in the same world the character gives us. So we get a world, not a person.

Zoe Lund played the center of that film. She was an unknown at the time, and extreme person who didn't act but simply be. It was extraordinary. After that, she continued her life of intense drugs and sexual damage, but in the context of the film world. Not on screen much, but as a hanger on to the creative side.

She is credited with co-writing this. Its hard to know what bits she helped with except for her own lines. She appears as a minor character here, someone that Keitel's character visits in her home to get dope. Serious stuff. She appears not as the mess that Keitel shows, but as a cool, composed vamp, assured in the path of drugs. She's made up to that sort of unreal doll style from glossy magazines.

She drifts over the serving of opiates like a sort of angel. Fiery red hair and tight black sheath. For the few moments when they are both on screen, you feel you are in the world. Its made more intense if you know she was an enthusiastic, cool junkie and died only a few years later from drug-related wear and tear. Its made more intense if you know she influenced the movie. She has some lines that otherwise would be daft, cheap philosophy, but which pierce when coming from her.

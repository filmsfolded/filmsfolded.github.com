Spoilers herein.

The French love Jerry Lewis and there's not much to do or say about that. This is not a comedy that works hard like the Coens or Farrellys for effect -- rather we have goofy and physical humor. Yet another reason to suspect that the French pride in superior culture disappeared when absynthe was outlawed. You should see this and 'Moulin Rouge' together.

The only funny thing here (to me) was seeing Christina Applegate NOT playing the stupid tart. That part goes to another girl. Just think about this for a minute: Applegate has the role of the rational, stable center!

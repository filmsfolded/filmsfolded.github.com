This is one of the most interesting old movies you will ever see.

Its designed to shamelessly display what are billed as the most beautiful women in the world -- excepting its star, Kitty Carlisle, who looks like a train wreck comparatively. There's no nudity in the modern sense, but its all about young bodies and refreshingly not large breasts.

The form is peculiar. Its half a stage show -- patterned after real shows by a real theatrical pimp. The other half is a murder mystery in which two deaths occur and are solved while the opening night show goes on.

The mystery isn't much. There's no detecting involved and its purpose is to allow us to know a few characters, every one of them repellent in some way, except for the anchor of the thing. Every girlie movie has a girl that is the center of illusion and in this one its Toby Wing playing one of several dumb blond stereotypes, this one more of the Betty Boop type: squeaky and solicitous, ignorant of when she is being ignored or even laughed at.

The mystery does involve some sinister Germans and Americans who take matters into their own hands. It was between the wars with the Germans, and Hitler was newly the "fuhrer." Its the show that's the interesting thing here. The numbers aren't as polished as you might expect, but they are among the most interesting you'll ever see.

One is a song about sweet marijuana where the backdrop is seven peyote buttons played by nude girls in blossom bottoms.

Another is very strange and makes sense if you note the antiGerman subtext. Its a battle of music between that great American invention of jazz (led by Duke Ellington himself) and some "German" old stuff, played weakly here. Its led by Franz Lizst, accompanied by ghostly and bloodless aristocrats. The American piece clearly wins, ending with a dance which is sort of a combination between ordinary stage choreography and black boogie woogie.

Its the only time I know in that era where black and white women dancers dance together. And the black women are every bit as lovely. Its shocking for the time, this celebration of the American spirit of woman. It ends by the Lizst character machine-gunning the Americans, killing all.

The first number is about the girls themselves, "where do they come from?" Its simply about where these lovelies originate and has them migrating from the east and the west through the doors marked with the famous (and quite real) motto; "through these doors pass the most beautiful girls in the world." They pass through the doors and are transformed into nearly nude fruits of the sea and packaged cosmetics for us (the male viewers) to consume. Its quite overt.

But to me the most interesting visually was a number which had our haplessly inept and ugly couple on an island singing. They are surrounded by waves made of feathers, undulated by scores of women: all longtressed blonds. Since they are credited as "chlorines," I suppose it matters that they are artificially blond, more submissive perhaps.

Its not photographed as well as it could have been, but its about as cinematic as you will get to this notion of vast pools of sexually available women, a sea of pulchritude. That it was set up in the previous number with women in vaginally opening clamshells, shows that the designer of this thing surely knew what he was doing.

One of the girls was Beryl Wallace, an Austrian Jewess with whom the man behind this was in love. Lucille Ball is also in there too.

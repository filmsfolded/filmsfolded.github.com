Spoilers herein.

I live near Pat Robertson's broadcasting empire and graduate school of film. It fascinates  me for a few reasons. Some of my fascination comes from their moral thuggery and my  concern for liberties , but that's old news. More interesting is how they fit my notion of  "folded" films; that's where some element is aligned with another disparate element -- in  this case the religious right makes films like "Left Behind." Those films have a story about  the battle between the Devil and Jesus, and they are done by people for whom the  making and showing of the movie is a very part of the same battle. More: the notions of  Christ and the Devil that have crept into their theology are purely cinematic, not literarily  Biblical.

So far, those films are clumsy, even laughable. But given the billion or so of dollars  behind Pat's film school, fundamentalist movies may soon be as artistic and effective as  religious (classical) music, architecture and painting. That makes this antifundamentalist  tract so puzzling. It is as clumsy and ineffectual as anything coming from the "other  side." It also is folded in the same way, assuming that many of the people involved feel it  is a blow for liberty.

It fails, and that's with some talent attached, most notably the usually very attuned  Pinter. Is it because religion and politics mix easily but the two together don't mix with  film? (But then there's "Night of the Hunter.") Is it because when the point of a film is to  be nasty it breaks it -- but what about "Shrek"?

I just don't know, but for the moment it seems that this is a bad film merely because it  was poorly written and directed, and that's all. Notably bad is the art direction. It could  have used a taste of "Brazil." Other missed opportunities: the book conflated the  episodes of secret games, the ritual of surrogate sex and the larger moves within the  warring factions. How could Pinter have not exploited this?

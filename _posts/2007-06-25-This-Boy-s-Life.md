You might like this. Some people do like that sort of acting where the only motions are visible, violent dissolution. Its a commitment to a style of acting that is more part of the demonstration of life than life itself. It pretends to be real but cannot. It overflows with demonstrations of emotion that suck emotion from us. 

deNiro growls. DiCaprio (at the end) grins. Our tragic gears have turned. It all works the way it is supposed to.

One wonders why these films are made. Is it really worth our time and money to convince ourselves that actors can convey that they can act? Do we really get some value or insight or even entertainment in a story such as this?

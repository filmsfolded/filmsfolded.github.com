Spoilers herein.

By now you already know that this is a bad movie, even at what it attempts. But it came dangerously close. Here is my notion of how it could have worked:

- The formula depends on all the girls getting killed but one, and each girl 'deserving' her death. But in this case, the (redheaded) girl who COULD have carried the film was the first one killed. I knew that moment we were in for a flaccid experience.

- There was a seeming knowledge that the main spookiness for the whole think was in entering the cabin, and discovering strange items. In another filmmaker's hands and eye this could have been way more disturbing than what we have here. The objects as weapons, the vehicular detritus of victims, the discarded and unused body parts were all opportunities unexploited.

- The bad guys are three guys, presumably brothers. One can readily believe the deformities and cannibalism, but no way in the world would those guys live without sex. Where were the women, who presumably would do the butcherin' and cookin'? There surely would be more of them than the guys and some of them pregnant, many of them spatting. Flesh-eating mischievous munchkins all about. No one can believe that these guys would have not sexually used their victims in some way. As depraved as we are prepared to let these movies get, I wonder why we had nothing like this terrifying possibility.

- And while we are at it, we see no eating. Nothing explicit at all. Our girl's corpse is prudently clad. This is a pretty goreless experience overall. Is it because the target audience is preteens?

- The treetop chase could have been as cool and dimensional as anything in 'Iron Monkey.' In one shot, it was: looking down and weaving around branches to see the torches below. Why not more of this damn scary stuff? In stead we get lots of helo shots of treetops as if that helped.

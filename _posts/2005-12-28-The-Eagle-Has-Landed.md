The mild attraction of this is that this time it is the Germans who are clever, Americans who are mostly dunces and incompetent and the Brits clueless. Well, that last is relatively common in war movies, but not the first two. So there's a bit of a twist on the ordinary adventure going in.

But this is clever in a different way. Basically, it is a con movie imposed on the war genre. In a con movie, you follow the con crew as they perform their elaborate plan. Usually this is prefaced by a long section where the team is assembled, usually around someone extraordinary.

Then the plan executes smoothly until one unplanned happenstance. What follows is our engagement in how the crew responds. Always, Always, there is a con-related revelation at the end. The revelation in this case was truly a surprise, a thrill at having been fooled.

Its interesting how some movies are constructed. This one has all the war movie intrigue and noise. It has some jaunty characters and oddly deviant women. But all that is just to fill up the space until the end where the con mechanisms snap shut.

Along the way are three talented actors, but only one (Sutherland) actually shining.

Spoilers herein.

This film is proof that sentimental drama is not necessarily a waste. Melodrama is when the characters are driven by the situation and that's certainly not the case here. Gillian Armstrong impressed with 'Oscar and Lucinda' which sculpted emotions far beyond what any actor might. And so here as well with lesser emotions.

The story is essentially about itself, a film about a book about writing itself from a recalled, probably invented memory centered on roles and role-playing. The book is about ideas and is disguised as simple drama. The film is more squarely a simple drama without the ideas, so the viewer should be warned that the journey isn't worth it unless you know the books -- at least 'Little Men.' In watching, you have to know what Bronson Alcott though about the relationship of schools, writing and life. But if you do, this becomes more than a family portrait.

This is the best period for both Dunst and Ryder, the rest are treacley, especially Sarandon. But the real star is Armstrong, whose eye is all about bringing frames to what is pictured as life. 

There are lots of books and plays in the story, but Armstrong also uses the metaphor of flowers for books (or potential books) throughout. The best shot is after Beth dies: the grandmother crushes roses to get their petals and sprinkles them on the deathbed, then a collection of dolls on a chest. This is terrific stuff, a lasting image. The next scene has Jo putting the dolls in the chest and discovering the childhood writing. Everything before and after revolves around that moment, which is when the writing of what we are watching begins.

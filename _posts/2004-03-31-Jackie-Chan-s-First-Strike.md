Spoilers herein.

Watching Jackie movies is sometimes a real challenge, especially the English language  ones. This barely qualifies as English, but is the best one, certainly better than any of the  Hollywood attempts.

What he does with ordinary objects is absolutely amazing, and the fact that they are  ordinary is part of the humor.

There's a classic ladder bit here that is I think his very best. Ignore the plot, it is standard  filler. 

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 3 -- Worth watching

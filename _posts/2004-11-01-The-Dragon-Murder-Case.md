Spoilers herein.

'I'm a coroner, not a philosopher!'

These things drive me crazy because they don't play fair. They set up the situation, display a few bodies then surprise us with a completely implausible solution that hasn't been hinted at all. Does it seem plausible that a murderer would try to frame a dragon?

The story within the story is the fiction of the dragon.

The only charm that these can give us is in a few interesting characters and an exotic setup. I did think this setup was among the strangest of the Vancers. But the characters are among the least successful.

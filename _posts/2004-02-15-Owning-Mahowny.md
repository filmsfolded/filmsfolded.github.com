Spoilers herein.

This is a story about the mundane, thoroughly mundane world with spikes of orgasmic  obsession. And it is a mundane film in every respect, every single jot, except for the  kundalini jizz of Hoffman. (His character literally steals from a yoga center.)

I think the people behind this project deliberately tried to make everything tasteless, the  opposite of 'The Good Thief,' and in perspective opposed to 'Croupier' in order to  accentuate this contrast.

P S Hoffman is the best of the generation after Penn in my book. That's because I don't  particularly value exuberant displays along the Italian line: deNiro, Pacino and so on. I'm  repelled by the 'natural' actors (Hackman, Freeman) who just show up and expect you to  bridge the distance to them and like them.

No, I need someone who understands current filmmaking, post-irony layering.

Presenting the actor as well as the character, but not as an actor.

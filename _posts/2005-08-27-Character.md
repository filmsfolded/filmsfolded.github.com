I liked this in spite of itself, and you probably will as well.

The story is completely unrewarding, a bleak tale of relationships unmended, unformed.

But that gives the creative team an excuse to make a Dutch film after the manner of Dutch painting. The theme of the story is light in darkness and the presentation complies.

The handling of light in this project is remarkable. It is not arty or self-conscious. It is in fact hard to notice because it merges so thoroughly with the way the location is photographed. That location is so enchanting you should see this in spite of the unrewarding darkness, the unuseful hopelessness.

It is set nearly a hundred years ago in Rotterdam and is able to use a whole strip of waterfront buildings from that era. It is hard to see how they have done what they have because so much of is real location. But the sense of gloom in the story comes from the intrusion of a mean God into the space of lives. And that's how these buildings are photographed.

See it for the architecture. Except for a final scene where a man falls down a shaft (which is too silly), this is as good as it gets without a good story.

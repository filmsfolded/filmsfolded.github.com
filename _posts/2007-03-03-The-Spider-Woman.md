By this time, the Holmes franchise was bankrupt. They'd kill it off shortly thereafter.

There's a scene here, where Holmes and Watson are in an explorer's house and discover a pygmy skeleton in a closet. Its cardboard.

That's indicative of the whole way this is handled. There's no detecting here, just Holmes in disguise. The business about spiders is supposed to be enough to interest us.

The woman adversary is less than adequate. Stay away from this.

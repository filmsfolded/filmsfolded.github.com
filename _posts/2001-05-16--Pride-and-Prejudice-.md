Spoilers herein.

This book is perhaps Austen's best. And the translation to video is near perfect so far as fidelity to the text. It has high production values as well, using the BBC model of no intrusive camera or editing art.

So what's wrong?

1) Translating from a book to a film is not a simple matter of preserving words, even preserving characters, even further preserving situations. They are different art forms altogether. It is impossible to convey Austen's intent this way. It's like pasting leaves on a canvas instead of painting a tree. See 'French Lieutenant's Woman' to see how intent is preserved by accommodating the medium.

2) That medium is TeeVee! When Austen wrote, books were important, ideas -- even popular ideas -- could carry weight. And hers did. But partly because she was a woman, and the ideas were in books. The kinds of books she wrote made fun of society, but did so from the most refined, intellectual medium yet invented. Seems sort of ridiculous to even consider those same insights having power when they come from the least intellectual medium yet invented.

3) That making fun of society was pithy in her time because the fools were the same as the readers. The books have since become timeless because of the language, but now the fools are a distant 'them.' We miss the chance to examine as closely our own foolishness.

By the time you get through, this isn't Austen anymore. It is instead, a nice costume drama with some amusing characters and refined language. That's probably good enough. But wouldn't real Austen be better?

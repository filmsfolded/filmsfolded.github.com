Why was this film made? To provide a vehicle for and to leverage emerging attention to its young star. But if this was the point, they should have used even fewer good actors than they did. Sally Fields shines so bright in her one scene that it reminds how much the others are struggling. Joan Cusack as always is an underappreciated master of timing.

Natalie is not a serious actress, but could be some day. Until then, she should stay away from the manufactured southern accent and pseudophilosphical monologues. Ashley Judd is a weak talent in an embarrassing role. Channing and Frain have been competent I think in the right vehicle, but here they are given simple balloons to inflate.

Here's an observation that will ruin many movies for you: when an actor is in over his/her depth, when they are TRYING so hard to act but just don't have the stuff other than an iron will to try...when this happens, they speak out of the right side of their mouths only. It's a right-brain/left-brain thing that you just can't escape. Watch Harrison Ford when the demands of the art are greater than trivial. And watch it here with MIT grad Dylan Bruno where the demands of the part are barely trivial. You can see him thinking excessively hard about how he should move.

The story is overly long and complex for its ambitions. I think what happened here is that they shot several versions of the story, and didn't get a clear message from their test audience, which is where pruning is done with such fluff. So they just left much of it in.

Lets hope that this intelligent, honest promising actress improves enough to be embarrassed by this some day soon.

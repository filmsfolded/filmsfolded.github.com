You can see Pixar being as Disney-fied at the same time Disney gets Pixar-ated. In this case, the experiments in a spatial camera all go away while the cartoon becomes an ordinary 3D production. And there's too much story.

It is a kid's movie, so you have to have some 'finding yourself' theme, hammered more bluntly than usual for Lassiter. It starts with a noir setup; random guy gets swept up in world dynamics that jerk him around (for the benefit of the audience). This is leavened by an 'Inspector Gadget' overlay, basically to stretch things out.

It may work for kids, since there is a lot of motion, but it is a bad movie.

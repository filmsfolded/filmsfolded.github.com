Spoilers herein.

From time to time over the last quarter century I go back to the Panther films, and am always amazed at two apparently conflicting results. One of these is the realization of how little entertainment value there is in these films. It is almost inconceivable that so many people would pay so much for so little.

On the other hand, one's MEMORY of the films is much better. The difference between the two is profound. In fact, in our household a reliable running joke is to ridicule the French by adopting some Clouseau pronunciation, suggesting a guileless danger. I suppose that many films are like this but not so obviously. No one actually enjoys 'Gilligan's Island' when watching it, but many enjoy the recollection.

Along the way, this time we get Kissinger and Gerald Ford. If you recall them in real life, even these characters prompt disturbingly fond memories in their parody.

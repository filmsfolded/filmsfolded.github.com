One of the significant tragedies in modern film is the coupling of one of our most powerful actresses with an insipid filmmaker.

Here, we have her placed in a film he made, playing an actress with an insipid husband -- a writer. He has a friend who is there simply to say goofier things, and thereby make the film appealing. As with all date movies, the separated couple is reunited by a public confession of love that is accepted (and happily ever after...). In this case, that confession literally happens at a play Julianne's character is in. So there's the simple, mechanical narrative fold.

As a quirky, inconsequential film, its not so bad, about in the middle of its cohort. Our goofy pair, anchored by Billy Crudup who is observed by Gyllenhaal (and in another position, Shandling). But no one really comes to film simply to tread water in the flood of desperate romance. We come for some advance. With films that advertise themselves as trivial, a trivial advance will do. 

Nothing here does that, and because the centerpiece is a woman who is patiently wasting her life, the message is clear. 

So I will recommend that you not watch this unless you are prepared to get depressed.

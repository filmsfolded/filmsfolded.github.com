Spoilers herein.

I'm one of the few (it seems) that really got excited about 'Blair Witch,' (and its sequel) as a cinematic event. I thought it was intelligent and clever. A lot of innovation in film concerns the relationship between observers and characters, and this was a novel take - especially the split between the video and film perspectives.

Additionally, it opened a new approach to both making and viewing. Watchers could get it without worrying about Godard. Filmmakers could play with a low cost production path. So something like this was inevitable. And it does start out as if it understood the strategy.

Surely a successful film could be made along these lines. But it would have to follow the rules of the camera: in every case you know who the filmer is. This project inexplicably tossed the convention midway. Perhaps they thought the gorilla was an operator/viewer.

The erotic stuff really could have worked, if it were erotic in any way. What we needed was 'ordinary' women without all the trappings of porn stars: hair, tattoos, runway trims, by- the-book sex. I think the right characters would be high schoolers along the lines of Larry Clark.

But what really kills this is the notion of magic. In the original, the world of observation enters a world of influence. All the influence is external, not internal as they would have here.

Too bad. I think someone can made a good and popularly effective film something like this, but this ain't it.

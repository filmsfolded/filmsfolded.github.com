Spoilers herein.

Yow, another formulaic movie that preaches breaking out of the formula. Another staid, riskfree production that promotes the taking of risk. Another film about filmwriting whose chief fault is the script.

The setup is simple: comfortable but compromised person is confronted and sees the error of their ways and enters a richer life. Worked for Dickens in 'Christmas Carol.' But here, it is not at all clear that capricious, obsessive serial sex with hundreds of dopers is superior to boring repression. The second story is a little more workable, and concerns a blocked writer freed by sex from the same angel. But this guy has clearly been mentally ill his adult life, and the implication is that the product of his writing is the execrable script we have been watching.

An odd production, because these three actors are capable of something with power in these roles: Sarandon in 'Thelma and Louise' and Rush in 'Quills.' Hawn has extreme limits, but good comic timing, and has made a successful career out of being a lovable, elderly sexual cutie. I saw only two worthwhile moments: the opening of the bathroom door to reveal Susan with her new hairdo, and a couple moments in the sequence reviewing the photos. The absolute low point was the valedictory speech where the terminally damaged kid is now miraculously repaired, but still illiterate as she - to applause denoting a mass epiphany - directs the listeners to 'whatever, do it true.'

This old guy got a tinge of sadness from the billboard scene. The original event was a campaign by John and Yoko to end war and enter an era of peace merely by declaring it. The image of sitting on that sign was apt and carried great power for me. The 'Got Milk' reprise denoted the relative powerlessness of this project perfectly. 

Eva Amurri created the best character. Lets watch her.

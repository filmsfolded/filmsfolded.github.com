I think of Dickens as caught up in the opposite dynamic we usually associate with Shakespeare. Old Will made constructions so elaborate and deep, they cannot possibly be fully appreciated in their original form, a play intended to be seen once. No, they are bigger than their original incarnation.

Dickens on the other hand inflated the appearance of his stuff, so. He elaborately doled it out in serialized chapters so the thing could seep for months. He fully intended them to be ponderous, full of life-changing lessons and morals. We can read them today as mere amusements, and from time to time we get adaptations like this that lighten it up even more.

Its strange in a way, this huge original story intended to shake big, simple lessons into us just as the villainous schoolmaster in it does. And all the juice is taken out of it, to be replaced by some grand sweeps of comedy and a simple lesson that in its plainness and unsophistication would even embarrass Dickens. And he was shameless in reaching an audience.

McGrath is celebrated for his "Emma," a successful movie by many measures. But to make it so, he had to wrack it from the foundations that Austen set, that delicate weave of engagement and self-examination. I enjoyed it for what it was, but how far is too far? If Shakespeare were presented as farting farm animals in party hats, would we mourn, or laugh as intended? Well, at least McGrath knows his craft. He knows how to let the creative team construct the darks and lights of the matter, and the actors to fill those spaces as best they can. Actually, I liked many images within this. Its no "Barry Lyndon," but visually similar. But I really hate how it has been evened out. The original carefully placed extremes as sort of speedbumps so that we had to pause in reading and ponder.

This removes those extremes and carries us smoothly along on a wind designed to amuse only without risk. If that's what you want, then this will be a well manufactured product for you to consume. Others may want to take Dickens more seriously, if not quite as seriously as he wanted.

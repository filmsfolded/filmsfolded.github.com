Spoilers herein.

I've never been a Hepburn-Tracy fancier. I believe them both to have been limited in  extraordinary ways. But I must admit that there are some very smart moments in this little  project for Katherine. There's a sequence about questions on a roof-top that sets up a  session where a drunk Kate asks a similar question of Tracy. It is one of the most memorable  lines in classic comedy.

And two of the supporting women (Joan Blondell and Ida Moore) give very good

accompaniment. 

The story has huge weaknesses, especially the romance with Gig Young. But the setup is  somewhat reflexive: She is in a film about her working for a 'film' company. The plot hinges  on the weakness of formula, and is itself formulaic in several key respects. There are several  drunk jokes in it, but much of it has a visibly drunk Tracy, especially in the apartment  scenes. She was infamous for researching all the elements of a project so she could 'tailor"  (her word) it to her strengths - and here she plays the researcher for the 'film' company.

Along those lines, Hepburn had several scenes inserted where she dramatically quotes  poetry, presumably so she could recall her Jo Marsh character, where she really was acting.  Oddly, this otherwise colorful production tones her hair down to brown.

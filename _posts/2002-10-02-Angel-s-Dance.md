Spoilers herein.

I do think this little bit of silliness is worth watching. The reason is that it targets a specific flavor of quirkiness. Nothing unusual there. But it ruthlessly sticks to that clear focus of quirk. Perhaps it helps that the writer is also the director. Perhaps it helps that the writer's sweet spot is precisely where Murray lives. 

No matter. It works because the world it creates has coherence. It becomes real, and then becomes leverageable for the humor to exploit. I imagine this project was too unimportant for the studio bosses to get in there and scramble it all around. 

The clarity of this project is mirrored in the clarity with which Angelica acts. She studies, grounds her intuition and acts with commitment. We can too until the story slides a bit at the end in an unexpected way.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching

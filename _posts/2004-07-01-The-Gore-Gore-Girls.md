Spoilers herein.

I often get great pleasure out of bad films. After all, nearly all films are bad - it is just a  matter of when you allow yourself to notice. I think there is a yoga of filmwatching where you  can transcend distractions and appreciate the craft - if there is any. Jess Franco movies are  a good case.

Here, someone thought it would be a good idea to put three elements together: ostensibly  prurient 'strippers;' some extraordinarily graphic, explicitly depraved mutilations and an  abstractly cartoonish detective.

All of these are found in 'mainstream' products. This detective is only a couple degrees more  ridiculous than James Bond or Hercule Poirot. Boobs in movies are as common as popcorn on  the floor and marketed in much the same way. With only some fine tuning (and a different  score) I'll bet we could pass these elements off in any venue.

Its the level of perversion in the murders that makes this stand out. Never mind that we  know it to be fake - it seems real because it is less fakey than the other elements of the  movie. It is pretty pornographic. The real shame is the level of deduction that comes from  this. Unlike 'Seven,' where the discovery had something to do with the mind-set of the  depravity, here the clue is a matter of makeup. It has nothing to do with the maiming.

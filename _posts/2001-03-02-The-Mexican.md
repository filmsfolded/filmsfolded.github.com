Spoilers herein.

This is a mess. After several years of independent films with bite, and some that actually made tons of money, the Hollywood machine finally gets in gear. Following their version of a formula, they pack it with box office draws. Try to cover all bases so that the largest possible audience will open it. So we have here 'Pulp Fiction' meets 'Way of the Gun' meets 'Pretty Woman' meets 'Romancing the Stone.' It is supposed to be a sweet romantic, character-driven, fate-driven, edgy, funny situation/chase movie, It skittles about, doing well with none of these.

I think the script had possibilities. Pitt and Gandolfini have the stuff. Roberts is wallpaper, but could have held up the role of shrewish neurotic. The problem is with the vision of the director. There is none. And thence to the editing, which lacks snap.

The director uses excessive closeups without understanding closein acting. This is just mere exploitation of famous smiles.

The only interesting element is an episode where Gandolfini discusses his new relationship. This is fine stuff, but is quickly thrown away as other elements of the story intrude. Pitt as always gets my appreciation for the sheer danger of the risks he takes. This time, the film is worthless, but one can really relate to how much he exposes. He is the Janis Joplin of acting today, and I hope he doesn't end up as a fat Brando.

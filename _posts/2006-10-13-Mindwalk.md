"Waking Life" would have been a good movie if weren't for the rather sophomoric ideas employed. "What the Bleep" had much the same level of intellectual banality but none of the cinematic magic of "Life." This movie is in between them. Its rather nice in choosing how to set ideas. But this is high school level.

Compare this to "My Dinner with Andre."

The site chosen is Mont Saint-Michel, and it is used rather well. Not brilliantly, but it is hard to mess up that spot.

The problem is that the place is unavoidably linked to Henry Adams, our first great freethought essayist, and one of the finest writers of any kind in English. Ever. And just the memory of how cleanly he outlines notions and crisply infers more, makes me want to throw things at the screen.

Liv is a marvelous actress, and probably an interesting person. How could she not be? But the lines she is given are bad indeed. Yes, they are the lines that many scientists would actually say, but those are secretary-scientists. I only wish that some really brilliant physicist who knows the limits of theories could have advised this.

As it is, it will damage you.

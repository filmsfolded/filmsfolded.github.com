Spoilers herein.

Vampire movies have two tracks, either they go for lushness or sex. 'The Hunger' tried both and missed. 

In the 'sex' category, there is a very small subcategory where the sex is explicit, though of course not explicitly shown. I know of only two that imply cunnilingus: this one and Carpenter's Â‘98 project. I've read that this was filmed with very much more explicit sex, and was cut heavily. The cuts show. As it is now, its absolutely unextraordinary. Perhaps restored it might be novel.

This has a 'harem' of vampire girls, a brunette, blond and redhead. Couldn't sort out who was who from the credits.

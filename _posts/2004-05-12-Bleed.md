Spoilers herein.

Another cheap slasher. Usually, what fans look for is excess or cleverness in the killings.  Here, there is something else of interest: at least until the final two scenes, the story is  put together with some craft.

What we often get is a mystery killer who is revealed at the end, often as some  supernatural evil. Here, we have three plots from the genre braided together. We have a  murder club, a cursed killer who blacks out and has visions and a masked goblin who  may have something to do with the others. 

Sure the acting and all the production values stink. But they almost always do, and at  least this time we get something to play with.

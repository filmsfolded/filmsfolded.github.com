Coppola is a cerebral filmmaker hampered by his heritage in Italian storytelling. The clash of his notions of introspection and layering with the Latin focus on character has resulted in some rather complex constructions. It is my impression that we marvel more at the complexities attempted in 'Godfather' and 'Apocalypse' than how well they were managed.

Here is a project that elegantly combines the two notions in a simple way and as a result -- for probably the only time -- Coppola completely surrounds and masters the ideas.

This is a voyeuristic artifact about a voyeuristic artifact. We suppose we know what we are doing in casually sitting down to spy on Hackman's character. We suppose we know what is to happen, just as he supposes, both of us relying on our history. In our case, it is a history of films.

All films are about other films. The dumb ones follow, the smarter ones comment and tweak and sometimes contradict, as here. And as with Caul, we are surprised to have our expectations turned inside out without completely understanding why.

This was back when Hackman actually tried. I wish Coppola still did. Oh well, we have his kids.

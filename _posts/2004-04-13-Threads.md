Spoilers herein.

When I was in high school in the early sixties, we had to watch a film of traffic fatalities,  presumably with the notion that we would be frightened into socially acceptable  behavior. 

Large segments of society work this way, and the roots of evil are that the 'good'  segments of society use this extensively. Religion.

And so we have here. I can think of no reason for this film to exist other than as a  sermon. As a film, I find it muddled. It starts with the rather belabored job at establishing  the community. Then it teases out a few 'threads' of stories, sort of 'Poseidon  Adventure' -like. Then it shifts again to one thread only, our Ruth and eventually her  monster of a child. 

The metaphor couldn't be heavier, but then this whole thing is a bludgeon. Heaven save  us from bludgeon-wielders of any stripe.

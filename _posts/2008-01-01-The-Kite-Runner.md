This was a relative disappointment for me because the potential was so great.

The structure has mundane and novel elements.

The mundane element is the story of redemption in the context of family and honor. Its embarrassingly pat.

Other ordinary elements include the nesting inner emotional turbulence in the sweep of violent national change expanded with grand landscapes. Also interesting but ordinary is the folding device: the story is the story of writing the story.

An uninteresting and poorly exploited novelty is the personal effect of Islamic pederasty as the key plot device.

So it all comes down to the leverage of the kites, and that is what attracted me to this. 

I'll tell you what I was hoping for. There's the direct metaphor: the intuitions of how the wind blows. The notion of working in pairs to excise another's effort. The business about harboring the winds. Stuff about the sacrifice to hands to manage the cutting tethers. Why this was seen as opposed to sharia.

This bit may have been covered well in the book, but is sadly lacking here and it is needed both for the direct emotional depth and as a foundation for the more dramatic and cinematic possibilities. 

Those are two. The key one is cinematic, I think. When photographing the kites, the filmmaker had an opportunity to go spatial. There are lots of narrative ties that could have worked here.

One is the notion of the Soviet invasion. The Soviets invented the sort of spatial camera movement I'm thinking about, starting with Tarkovsky, then Kalatozov. The idea of being on the ground and having warring ideologies is directly related to the European political modernism that comes from Marxian dialectic, now unwittingly adopted by jihadists. The relationship of abstract space to warriors on the ground is too perfect to not use and use well.

Its a real shame. The camera is static. The presentation of the kites is flat, without depth or even color. As it is mostly computer generated, it would have been easy to have been at least as dimensional as a Pixar or WETA project. Cafe FX, who I think handled this aspect, just doesn't have the imagination or cinematic background.

Kites, eye, copters, abstraction, forces, narrative dynamics, war. Not here. Why?

The other possible cinematic/dramatic link with kites and dimension is through the culture. I thought we were going to get some of this. Its no accident that Afgans do this kiting. They are a spatial people. They think dimensionally. In the Hanafi world, they are the most free, the most florid and least constrained in their souls as they think of cosmic things.

I thought we were going to get this, as I say, when I saw the opening credits. They spin arabic-like titles out of interweaving space. Its all wrong in the execution: Afgan calligraphy isn't rigidly vertical as here, but wildly animated. In fact it is the most human and emotional of the styles. The almost art nouveau Zoroastrian influence on Afgan versions of the ij√£za script is spatial in the way these kites are, even to the entwining strings and swooping, turning surfaces. Its space made into words and perfect for this project. How could they have missed it?

It is spatial, free, and lovely. We could have seen how it nested in the rather complex Pashtun/Dari spirit quite independent of Islam, predating it by millennia.

It could have been powerful. This film could easily have changed lives in important ways. Dreams, imagination, writing, space, freedom. Instead, it merely tells a story, a simple, flat, colorless, redemption story.

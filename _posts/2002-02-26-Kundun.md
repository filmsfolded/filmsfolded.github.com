What slaves we are to our culture! My own test of a great filmmaker is not whether they can make an effective film, but whether they have the navigational skills and propensity for risk to take us to unfamiliar places. That means unfamiliar to the filmmaker as well.

Scorsese has made some powerful films for sure. But they are all about New York Italians. Even the Jesus story is forced into this mold. He is obviously aware of this limitation, so we have 'Age of Innocence' and this.

How sad it is to see his inability to wrestle a coherent center out of the richness of Tibet and the era. We do get some lovely images, and a few heartfelt performances, but never anchored to any new mysteries. We learn or experience nothing new here. What we get, he has mapped to the familiar.

Verdict: Scorsese is not on my list of masters worth watching.

Spoilers herein.

I was as disappointed in this sequel as the first. Not because there weren't some interesting  elements - there were. But because the key promise is broken. This is a superhero whose  herolife is swooping and three-dimensional. The future of exciting movies is in exploring  and exploiting this notion. 'Finding Nemo' does. 'Val Helsing' does. But this one, which is  built around the graphic senses of motion and depth is completely devoid of these except for  a few brilliant moments in the first exterior fight with Ock.

I used to think this was because huge projects demand risk avoidance. But with so many big  films having a dimensional architecture these days, even to 'Pirates of the Carribean,' I can  only say that now it is a matter of incompetence.

There are other blots as well, most notably Kirsten Dunst. She had one of the most explosive  introductions of any actress in 'Vampire.' But as an adult (still playing youngsters), she is in  way over her head. She needs to stick to vacuous, fun-loving dimwits like she did well  enough in 'Eternal Sunshine.' 

MJ in the comic is a voluptuous model. They needed to get someone who actually looks  redheaded and IS voluptuous and full of life. An Alicia Witt type.

But there are things to like. As I understand, the shooting started without a script and at  some point much later Michael Chabon was brought in to fix it. The film was the mess we  sometimes still see. I'm told that he fixed many 'ordinary' elements relating to dialog and  sequence and such.

He also emphasized the basic foundation of the thing. Spidey was invented not as another  superhero, but as a story about the superhero story. A metastory, one that already had  several 'story-about-story' elements. The main one in the Â‘book was the deal with Jameson's  creating a negative) myth with Parker himself complicit.

Chabon uses all his 'Wonder Boy' tricks to emphasize these and add others: MJ is now an  actress, and get this - starring in the first play about metastory. Osborn creates a metastory  about his Dad, Aunt May about her husband, her husband (from beyond the grave) about  Peter, MJ about young Jameson, arms about the motivation of Octavius...

Its a carnival of narrative pasted on other narratives. If only the vision were as clever and  competent as the ideas.

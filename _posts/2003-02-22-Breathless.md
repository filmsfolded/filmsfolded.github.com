Spoilers herein.

This highly influential film is regarded because the director was a writer with interesting ideas and he could self-promote. As a result, a few theorists and all their legions of followers have designated this an 'important film' and specifically for the reasons that Godard thought it was: reality vs documentary (portrait vs person) with a few filigrees of resulting unusual cinematography, editing and performance. It is amazing that these rather slight ideas had such power and influence forty years ago. Perhaps the slightness is an illusion because the ideas had such power they transformed our entire background.

Here's another reading, one which presumes a complement to what Godard THOUGHT was the point: you can either be a thinker or an artist. If you are a thinker making a film, the film can only be as deep as your thoughts, which usually aren't. But if you are an artist, you tap into a knowing intuition, a state of communicative grace from something deeper than any maker or consumer of the artifact. So lets suppose Godard wasn't just a strong willed writer making statements like Ayn Rand writes. Lets say that this is a collection of forces that Godard responded to unknowingly and just dive into those forces. 

The French are obsessed with being important (or appearing to be so), especially in the arts and most especially in film. So when the overwhelming wave of (vulgar-by-definition) American influence so transforms the media away from your control, you need to strike back with matters of style. 'New Wave' is to film as Perrier is to water - there's a real style here, but it is of a relatively synthetic nature.

Michel Is French, trying to live as an American film star: this fact is pounded in a manner so bluntly it defaces the rest of the art. Patricia is an American trying to be French, working at several levels, sexual and intellectual. The French authorities (here conflated with the film intelligentsia) are feverously searching for Michel to eliminate creeping Americanism. Eventually, they succeed, aided by Particia. At the end Michel makes his film (the faces) and in a supreme irony, uses an American film posture to demean the 'American' film experience. The American is flummoxed, in a double tragedy.

My own belief is that in the grand scheme of things, this is a relatively trivial project. Godard WOULD go on to do some much more interesting, challenging and worthwhile work. I recommend 'King Lear.' See that instead, unless you are a student in which case, Godard's writing will force you to see this.

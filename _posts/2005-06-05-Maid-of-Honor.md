I came to this hoping to find something like "Go Fish" which I thought was both charming and a seductive introduction into lesbian seduction for a nonlesbian viewer. 

What this is instead is a small, very focused little study on commitment. It does involve some same-sex attractions, and the ability to have few actors depends on this. But the emotions and roles and situations are pretty universal. I thought it well enough done as a study. But why?

I'm a student of why things cinematic work. They have to go deep whether it seems so or not. This appears to be deep, at least it deals with deep stuff. But it tells us nothing; it doesn't inject itself into our dreams.

What can one say about Arnie's films? When he's in charge, they are horrid, dumb, usually bloated. 

But you have to give him some credit. He is intelligent enough to have scripts written that emphasize a dual reality: a real guy and an imaginary superhero. Most of the projects he has initiated recently have this flavor, especially here and in 'Last Action Hero.' So at least he aspires to do something intelligent.

But the problem is that he has neither the depth to really develop a concept, nor the skill as an artist to craft the product. Too bad.

As an aside, he seems to be an icon for extremists. When I said something mildly negative about him in another comment, I started getting disturbing email from skinheads.

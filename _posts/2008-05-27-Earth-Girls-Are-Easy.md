I'm not sure, but I think this is a better candidate for a midnight dressup singalong than "Rocky Horror." But I suppose corsets are more fun for the wearer than very skimpy bikinis.

It hardly matters if the folks who made it intended us to take elements of it seriously. Its ours when we watch it and can take these things on any terms we desire. If you are like me, and take "Barbarella" not seriously, but as something important, you will do the same here.

Its not quite in the category I follow of filmmakers directing their lover, but its close, as we know these two are lovers in real life.

It asks a lot of the viewer, to believe the story, what with the props and costumes. But its precisely the same degree the characters on the screen are asked to believe about each other and the nature of love. Somehow it makes it easy to think about romance.

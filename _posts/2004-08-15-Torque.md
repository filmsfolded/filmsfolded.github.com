At one time, when you had the white and black hats, the whole focus of the movie was the good guy. He (always he) was a role model, spawning character-centric genres.

'Good Bad Ugly' was perhaps a small dip into the world of the bad guys, followed possibly by Tarantino's adventures. Now, these pseudo westerns are all centered on the bad guys. That's who we want to be. The good guy here is so shiny vanilla, so formulaic (which his girlfriend) and in such predicable situations, he fades into the background as part of the score.

The idea here is to give strutting teens interesting (to them) bad guys. That's why the bad guys, some of them anyway, have to have some sort of ethics, honor, even logic.

The question is, whether the ones in this movie are interesting enough. 'You Got Served' is a half-click better with the bad guys. And its form of dance is a complete waste of time. Here, it is motorcycles and even less interesting, even with the 'Fast and Furious' effects.

This is stylish, but the style is wasted. The Pepsi product placement ruins the only chase sequence that has any gas.

Who is the actress playing the bad girl? Another Ilsa she-devil clone, but a good one.

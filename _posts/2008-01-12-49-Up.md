I have to admit that this series is at least historically significant, and on that measure alone you should dive into it. But I would recommend seeing this one alone.

The first few really did ping on a very simple and obvious class dynamic, more of interest to an English audience going through a reinvention. The subjects were treated less as people than as examples of a national pool. The poor kids turned out to be low class nitwits and the rich kids differing only in being rich nitwits. 

Then in the middle, Apted decided that it really was about individual lives, and started to hammer away on the changes in life. The editing got successively more tedious as we were given more and more facts. After a few in that phase we ended up with 42 Up, absolutely the worst of the lot. Its because it had more Apted than subject. Like his subjects, he hadn't grown much at all, and while his subjects mewed on mostly about motherhood, it became obvious that it was an obsession of his as well. 

So that last edition was just hammering away on the maternal glue of the family, presuming that we will all relate and extend the notion on our own to the things that matter in our lives. Or alternatively collect around them whatever voyeuristic pleasures you wish. But this one at least is good film-making. It has a center and economy which all the recent ones lack. And it has something new: self reference. Nearly every one of the dozen is asked about how the series affects their lives. The answers are the best part, in fact the only thing that I find mildly interesting.

That's because there is no great window into class dynamics here, no window into anything other than a dozen peoples' lives. And they are profoundly uninteresting people, people with no ideas, no real souls. People with nothing to offer except local goodness. The problem is that they started with 14 kids and are stuck with them, no matter how vapid their lives are. I suppose that's the appeal to some, but I wish they had started with ten thousand children, picked the ones with lives or souls, even tragic that could tell us something and then worked backwards.

It doesn't change me at all, and I find none of these people remotely interesting. I can get the same, more humanly in real life every day.

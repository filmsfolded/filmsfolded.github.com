Spoilers herein.

This was well conceived but, except for the lead actress, poorly executed. The devices are few and familiar:

-tilted sexuality

-a noirish world where fate is distinctly anti human

-a completely unexpected twist at the end

This started with much better material than say, 'Basic Instinct.' The idea of sexual exploitation is much the same but the 'plan' much more interesting. What went wrong? Nearly everything, and most of it having to do with this being a TeeVee production. The idea of the sexual exploitation was good. Fiorentino knew what she was about, but - except for a moment with the fence outside the bar - this wasn't exploited. I'm not necessarily talking about more explicit sex or nudity. The tone here was hampered by the clear position of the director to not take the sex very seriously. In this project, that was lethal. Check out the Japanese 'Audition' to see what I mean.

The noir element suffers from similar meekness. In a noir world, fate is capricious. People can be calculating but they never, ever are in control. When they succeed, they do so by attuning to the cold mechanics of the universe. To be noir is to be cinematically cold, which means that you must do some disturbing things with the camera with NO relief. This camera is not disturbing at all, rather comfortable in fact. Another limit of TeeVee.

The one really cool thing about this is the twist. It has a triple twist of sorts, an obvious one in which our dupe is stuck with the murder; a 'procedural' one in which we discover that the 'Double Indemnity' conspiracy with battered wives was a hoax as a minor embellishment on the grand conspiracy; and the real twist. That real twist IS the final seduction, the seduction of Bridgett and Trish by each other to 'buffalo' poor Mike. It is hidden, but there and way cool. Trish is played by a porn star woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman, and one can only guess what was shot and cut.

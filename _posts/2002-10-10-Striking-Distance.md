Spoilers herein.

This is a completely unremarkable film except for the bigger than usual twist at the end.

What I find interesting in reviewing Willis' career is how important it is for actors of his type to find projects that exploit their niches.

By actors of his type, I mean actors with a single gift -- something that on repeating becomes an expected trademark. With Willis, it is that wink at the audience, a sort of Milton Berle aside that says: ' I'm an actor and you know I know you know it. I'm here to entertain you and we can both share in watching me have fun.' In this, he follows a trend begun by Gable (in 'It Happened One Night') and became attached to a career first (I think) with Cary Grant.

Willis has some power as an actor, but he just cannot escape this winking mode. It worked in 'Die Hard' stuff, 'Pulp Fiction,' (where his role as boxer-performer mirrored it) and in '6th Sense,' where the two roles of winker and character were leveraged in the story twist.

But this film neither wants nor needs that wink. It makes no attempt to exploit it. And as a result comes off as a simple TeeVee movie-level project. Ms Parker doesn't help.

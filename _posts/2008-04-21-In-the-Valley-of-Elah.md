I'm torn when presented with films like this. 

Its antiwar in a deep way that I am drawn to. It makes no judgments on the war, only the effects of war. So it hits in a place that seems comfortable.

And it is so competent at storytelling, and so economical in exploiting the conventions of unraveling a mystery that you have to admire it. It is, after all, a simple mystery form using long standard conventions of detective redemption. 

By design, these two things are engineered so well you might form a religion around it. But its repellent in its manipulation of as many dimensions of weakness it can find in family and matters of honor. It tells us nothing, we do not or cannot grow, learn, understand. It takes and never gives. Its selfish art, whose purpose it to attract our loyalties and thence our dollar. In a real movie, this would be revealed to us, that the same thing we are bemoaning in concert with the filmmaker is the very same simple knot he is using to get us into the story.

That sort of deliberate embarrassment works for me, and makes these bright colors matter. This film doesn't matter. You will nod your head while in it, and forget it on the way home.

But the skill is admirable, particularly the monologue at the end by a soldier we briefly have met. Its a masterpiece of acting made brighter by the Jones "serious by catatonic wrinkles" method of acting.

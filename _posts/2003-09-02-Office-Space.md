Spoilers herein.

This is a film about the soulwrenching death of working for an inhuman corporate  machine. The director himself was doing this as an employee of such an inhuman  corporate machine and went though his own soulwrenching experience.

The movie is a collection of skits, with one cartoon character and a hastily concocted  unifying story. A couple of the skits are funny, but why people like this has nothing to do  with that. It is because we encounter three or four bosses and coworkers worth hating,  and are given space to do so.

'Nine to Five' or 'Working Girl' are of the same ilk, but better. 'Office Killer' is far cooler.

When does a story outgrow its binding to itself and become a meta-story?

Its a tough question when watching this. The story itself is deliberately weak, involving a magician sells what could be described as story-objects, magical toys that help play themselves. He passes his magic to an unassuming girl. Some minor glitches develop and are resolved.

The meta-story is that we have this actress Natalie Portman. The public seems to love her: she's intelligent as actresses go, poised and cute.

If you follow the choices she has made -- surely under the influence of expert advisers -- you can see that what is intended is to recreate her as a modern Audrey Hepburn. There are matters of carriage, of personal tone, and screen presence that are deliberately evoked. This film is almost the ideal opportunity to introduce her fully as the new Audrey.

So what's the meta-story? Someone representing the industry (fairly enough played by Hoffman) is surrounded by magical storybits, somehow by his presence making that magic happen. He blesses his protégé, who "runs" the store. Lessor actors are shown as hat collectors, who wear a different hat each day.

She is an imperfect performer, actually one of supreme promise who has lost her confidence. (She is a pianist.) The magic somehow restores that. Along the way, we hit all the Audrey touchstones in hesitation, facial poses, even lovely little coos. The hair style and tailoring to an increasingly slight build completes the picture. 

An accountant provides the designated watcher who finally "sees."

There is a nice in-the-store fireworks effect that even seems tailored for the Hepburn style.

You have three basic choices when you seek funding for a film. 

You can make what you want regardless of genre-defined market niches. The film can be its own being, a true work of art for better or worse.

Or you can do what most people do: cleave strictly to the rules of a genre at the time you are making the film. These rules allow for some very sophisticated stuff to be done. 

But there is a third way, you can splice bits of several genres together. This allows for the possibilities of the best of both of the above worlds. There are filmmakers that do this, more and more recently. This, I think has less to do with viewer effectiveness than the mechanisms by which films are pitched: you have to describe using genre shorthand, so it is handy to say that it is such and such but with so and so. Jane Austen but with Zombies. Haunted house horror, but with slapstick. 

This film is about a being that is a splice among several species. As a film, it also is a splice among several genres.

Designers in both cases know that the system will only work if the elements of one component are allowed to breath by denying the components of another component. Success of a splice depends not on what you put in, but what you take away.

If you bother to read the comments here and among critics, they almost exclusively are complaints about what was left out. Each reviewer wants a clean, specific genre and is disappointed that expected things weren't there.

I think if you go into this with the innocence of a new being, you will like it as I did. There is an honesty in Sarah Polley that isn't used well here, but which we know anyway. There is an honest enough portrayal of a quasi-human being. We have a long form story arc that is rich enough to have four films combined in its three acts. 

I'm happy to experience an inferred story without having to be worked through it. I'm happy to have four stories each in their own genres slightly sketched and have me fill in all four universes. This almost worked for me, but for a few unacceptable transgressions. 

In the beginning, we are meant to believe that the science here is real science. 

In order for certain biological processes to be made cinematic, complex interactions are shown via supposed computer graphics that the on-screen scientists would use. But these are so crude and irrelevant they offended me enough to tarnish the whole film. 

Likewise, the idea that breakthrough results live and die based on the effectiveness of a ten minute press conference is bizarre. If there were even a hint of a breakthrough people would be breaking the walls down. 

I easily allow the fiction that the creature could be made and hidden as depicted. But if they just had not tried to explain things! The splice with that genre just doesn't hold.

This film references the Frankenstein legacy, but the three original films each dealt with science in radically different ways. (See my comments for those films for details.) In none of the three cases were genres spliced. In none was science introspective within a marriage.

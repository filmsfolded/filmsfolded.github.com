Spoilers herein.

von Trier's strategy is simple: expose an actress in the most painful way and exploit it with abandon by personalizing camera techniques.

Here, he lucked out with a particularly courageous actress, unlike the much thinner 'dancer.' Watson really does amaze, and this is a powerful film. Make no mistake, we watch Emily's insides here, not Bess's.

But how much reward can one get from this raw voyeurism? There's not a shred of intelligence in this kind of work, just stomach-punches. Except for some proof of the power of film and personal acting, we'll have to wait for someone else to actually transport us, change us.

Remakes and sequels provide me with a playground. What can you do with the same world, the same characters?

Sometimes the results are world-changingly insightful. They were for me in any case with the original Frankenstein trio and the Aliens trilogy (which incidentally follows the same pattern). Rocky? Well, let's let that one pass.

This has some interesting features. The movies themselves are trivial, even for the intended kiddie audience, and this is the weakest. But the evolution is rather solid.

In the first, the scope had to do with ambiguities and issues of self. Identity is set up as the main thing. As in all of them, it is blunt, obvious, overdone and the resolution is childish. But the identity of self concept is at least worthy.

The second expands that to identity of the family. Here it is a simple fabulation: Mom, Dad and teen son. The mechanics of description and resolution are similar. They involve the same situations. All of the key characters are the same. All those that are not are based on the same prototypes of the earlier film. The machinery works the same, only the identity questioned is larger.

Where the first is self, the second is family, this third is community. As before, the same tropes, characters, plot arc. As before, the examination is blunt and worthless. But the point is that it is the same. Same machine parts. Same basic problem. Differently shaped sausage.

Spoilers herein.

Let's be honest about what this is: an opportunity for two well known tough guy actors to  square off in mutual respect. In this case, the writers did a good job with the mechanics;  there are a couple nice twists, there are clever man/machine commentaries and the setup  (involving a metaphor-laden dogfight) doesn't seem contrived. Only in the case of Angie  Dickenson is something clumsily shoehorned in.

And they are blessed with a wild, solitary location, similar to that exploited well by  'Jeremia Johnson' of ten years earlier. 

But that's where the competence ends. These two actors can be used well, but here  neither has an edge. The key problem is in the direction. There's no soul to this project.  It feels like a collage of artifacts. If has some sense but no coherence. That's Hunt's  whole career.

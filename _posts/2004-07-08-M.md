Spoilers herein.

Seeing this again makes me wonder about the different ways people evaluate filmmakers. For  me, a filmmaker has to have skills in conveyance ideally through novel as well as effective  means, but he/she also must have something worth conveying.

In the first measure, I've always regarded Lang as a production designer not a filmmaker. He  poses as a filmmaker just as the seducer here poses as a friend. Both are talented fakers.

In the second half of the equation, I have always been unsatisfied by the elementary social  commentary he selects.

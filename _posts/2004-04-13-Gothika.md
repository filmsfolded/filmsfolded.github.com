Spoilers herein.

People like horror, especially supernatural horror because they deeply believe (usually  subliminally) in the supernatural. That's religion, folks. It all depends on this fear which  seems hardwired.

But that fear is based on a logic of sorts. We fear because we know how the system  works. 

Any movie that deals with this has to conform to one of these logics (or create a new one)  and exploit it. We need something to allow our terror to stick too. Just parading ghosts  and death won't do it.

Too bad too, because Penelope's first scene here may be here best ever.

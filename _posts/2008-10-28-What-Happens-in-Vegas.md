I believe in a building in LA, is a long wall with a chart, first designed and displayed in 1958. It still has the same basic structure, but with more elaboration as clever folks have thought of new ways to repackage the date movie formula.

A standard form is the "happened One Night" model, where an unlikely couple is cast together. They hate each other, allowing for comic situations and in the final moments discover the immutable love we expect. Its not often that we have significant elaborations. I admire them when I see them even if the movie is bad, because when it is "good" it still is a date movie with discouraging aspiration. 

The wrinkle this time is small, they are cast together conventionally enough. Its the middle part that is slightly novel: they have to pretend to be happy while trying to get the other to quit. Its a simple extension of the recent "how to lose a guy"

Diaz seems worn out. 

Not novel enough for anyone to see.

Spoilers herein.

As a mystery, this is unengaging. But it has other attractions.

It is an early cross-media project: the mystery except the ending was broadcast on radio and a national contest held to 'write' the ending. This is the purest type of detective story, the kind where the author wrestles with the viewer for control over the outcome. The movie starts with a reproduction of the announcement of the contest.

Then we are run through a rather ordinary 'closed road to the estate' mystery, with tons of suspects and hidden passages. The novelty is that the head of a gang of thieves chooses to be the detective to get to the bottom lest he be blamed.

The murder weapons are darts. Someone at Radio Pictures was having some fun with the notion of 'tossing' control from radio to movies, from suspect to suspect, from crook to detective, as it turns out from one murder victim to another, and in the murder weapon.

Some early use of sound. Some precode gowns.

Spoilers herein.

I particularly appreciate films whose manner is consistent with its matter. This one is, but  the problem is that the overriding notion is deliberate lifelessness. I suppose there is a  certain teenage audience for this sort of thing: masochistic narcissism. But once  someone has done it -- or even thought about it, it is enough for us all.

The idea is life by slogan, by motion. Dry sex. Inherited passion. Emulated life. Confused  but committed participants. Pretty tired and tiring stuff. The novelty here is the film is  designed the same way as a sort of art-as-politics. 

Pass on this. It is almost as bad as TeeVee without the plastic giggles.

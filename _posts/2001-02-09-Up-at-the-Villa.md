Spoilers herein.

You know, the story on which this film is based has real richness. It is about unintended wrongs and the business about Italian fascism is supposed to be the target. The language is rather internal. Love is just the frame.

What a mess this film has made of it! The script took the story at face value and gives us the episodes as if they matter on their own. All the marvelous language and internal stance are gone. I suppose they thought some lush photography would suffice. How daft an assumption.

There are some great actors here (Penn, Jacobi) and some at least competent ones (Bancroft, Thomas) -- Kristin sure has made some bad choices in films.-- But these walk through their parts, reading the story to us. There is perhaps enough to satisfy the Hallmark crowd, but all the art has been bleached out of this tapestry.

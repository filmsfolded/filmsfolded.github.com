Spoilers herein.

We are in the midst of a flood of films that portray the adolescence experience with extreme gloom. 'Ghost World,' 'Donnie Darko,' 'Ginger Snaps,' 'Gummo,' 'Go,' Korine's work, many others. This one plays it so straight one wonders who they thought the audience might be. The treatment (frank sex, 'real' pacing, zero intelligence required) seems targeted toward the same demographic as that shown. But the very values of that group, especially the salacious sex, are just the things shown to be bankrupt. Yet the camera goes just where a teenage boy would put his eyes. Puzzling.

These kids do a fine, professional job. They certainly seem committed and some surprise. The young women here seem to know what is needed and put themselves in just the right place, and give the right faces. But they lack the control over their body that is required for real effectiveness. I suppose either you have it or not. The nudity and simulated sex seemed exactly right for the story and did not seem gratuitous at all. That, and the commitment behind it, goes a long way toward hiding this deficiency in how you act with the many elements of self.

I tracked this down because of the obvious Macbeth reference and the fact that a redhead (artificial, it seems) was the focus. I haven't worked it out yet, but there's something special about redheaded harridans in theater -- those who use sex to influence and control the violent acts of their lovers. This is one of the deepest archetypical touchstones of storytelling I suspect.

But the film fails for me. And that's because the director thinks making films is all about acting. And what we have here is collection of actors operating within the general tone set by the director. But there is no cinematic skill in tying the elements into a smooth narrative: The story unfolds in a drugged way. There's no pushing from one scene to the other. No collaborative space among the actors into which we can enter. All of the films noted in the first paragraph did this much better.

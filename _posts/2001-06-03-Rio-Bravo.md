Spoilers herein.

In its day, this probably delivered entertainment and built important American stereotypes. But now, its dust cover has been lost, and it is just plain bad.

Wayne could never act -- by modern standards, his fat butt and bird chest are noticeable. This story is a simple setup -- the secondary plot line is similarly simple: Deano wants to stop drinking. Oh, and there's a love story of sorts. The pacing is a grind, with every turn predictable. There aren't even any shots of the west here, the whole thing was filmed on a back lot.

None of what I have mentioned is any better than hundreds of Warner Brothers Â‘60s TeeVee episodes. That this is on the IMDB best films list is a scandal; an absolute embarrassment even though Brennan CAN act.

What's interesting in this film is the appearance of Ricky Nelson. He would soon become Rick and become a leader (with Graham Parsons) of the western rock movement, which is now the repetitive tripe called 'country.' Graham would die in a couple years from drugs, and the same drugs would grind Rick down slowly until his plane accident.

What's of interest here is that you can witness firsthand what may be one of the great tipping points in music history. Black music was coming to be kid's music soon -- the Elvis explosion was just beginning. The other indigenous American music was just being artificially split between 'folk' which the peacelove crowd would adopt, and this music here. It was first adopted by faux rednecks (like Wayne) and later a mainstream. Both threads were hillbilly music.

Film westerns by this time had had several decades of singing cowboys, but it was Rick's genius (actually Ozzie's) to link western music to POPULAR music, which then meant kid music. Check out the hair. Check out the passing of the torch from Deano to Rick to both serve the galoot Sheriff (surrogate for the public). Check out the name: 'Colorado.' Check out the real hillbilly in Brennan limping along when not stuck in the back.

Watch this stinker not because it is remotely good, but because it may have been one of those butterfly flaps that created a hurricane in the music business.

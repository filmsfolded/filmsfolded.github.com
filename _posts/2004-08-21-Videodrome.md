Spoilers herein.

Does anyone still doubt that Cronenberg is a genius of organic metaphors for self-reference?

The raw stuff of his films consists of two components: remarkably organic sexually-inspired  objects and deeply self-referential folds. Here, the film is about perverted film and the two  (our film and his film) are mixed helter skelter.

I like this project (and the similar one about games) because it is so unconstrained. It seems  to have been made up as they went along and ideas appeared. This is Godard done right in  my mind because it is as cerebral, but more rooted in cinema. Also it has the uncanny ability  to blur just where we fit in. As viewers of course, but we also get entangled in the folds. Are  we guilty? Is the very act of seeing that we are guilty what conveys our guilt? Is this sex or a  futuresex?

Is it too late?

As a matter of technique, it is genius to caste Deborah Harry. She does part Bardot in  'Contempt,' part 'Repulsion' with movies, part the 'Fight Club' to come.

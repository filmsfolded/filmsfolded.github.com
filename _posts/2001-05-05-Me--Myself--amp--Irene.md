Spoilers herein.

Aboutthe only thing interesting about this film is Renee.

Rene burst on the scene with 'Jerry.' There, her job was to be plain, vulnerable. And she was.

I next saw her in 'One True Thing,' and can't remember a single thing about it.

Then, 'Nurse Betty,' which was ultrasophisticated in concept. There, she was asked to be plain and vulnerable, and she was. But I thought she also resonated with the multilevel states of awareness in the film. That would make her an intelligent actress.

Then, immediately this -- plus an affair with Mr Rubberface. Here, she is asked to be plain and vulnerable, and she failed. What's up? Has another frail talent been bulldozed?

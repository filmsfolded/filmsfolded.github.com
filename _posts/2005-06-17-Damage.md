There are a large number of stories in life, but many fewer that can be formed into a workable book. Even fewer stories are possible in film, which itself is an amazing story.

Of these few types, the one that dominates is the broad category of what has come from noir.

What makes noir work is the story exists in a world of fate, and the fate "writes" the story in such a way that people are selected at random and their lives are toyed with in ways that make no sense at all. These films work well when the audience identifies with the side of fate, at least as much as with the poor saps being manipulated this way and that.

There are lots of films that think they are "character" pieces that fall into this river unawares. So they spend all their attention on the tragedy of the actors, and on the angst that comes from their characters. When films do this, and come too close to noir without ambiguously placing the audience as the writer, they fizzle.

This film fails, It could have succeeded if we were really hitched to one of these characters. These are the right players, the right director and writer for this. Malle was on hand for two of the most influential films in history. Hare did perhaps one of the best book adaptations in all filmdom. Binoche CAN inspire screen obsession.

But the material is wrong. No fate. You need to compare this to "End of the Affair" to see material that breaks at the right joints.

Spoilers herein.

Thank god for Mike Figgis. There are more clever directors, and others more intelligent. But no one quite as obsessed with the structure of the narrative as visual music. Some of his other experiments play with folding in other ways; here we get an adventure in parallel narratives at different levels of abstraction.

Some reach toward the archetypical, others toward the personal, all very much like 'Singing Detective' which it resembles in several ways. Nothing in it struck me solidly until the surprise at the end where Adam and Eve exit the garden to paparazzi and news cameras.

Endings are always problematic for experiments where the form is not well established, because so much depends on what we expect. This ending saved the whole project for me. Rugged. Completely transformed all that went before.

That's because he treats the whole thing until that point as music: starting with a pure theme, embellishing with variations in several parallel threads, then abruptly shifting from musical noodling to cinematic plunge. That plunge of us INTO the film at long last is his (and his archetypes) exit OUT OF the film into the unkind space that surrounds music.

Some films are structured this way, where the entire film is merely preparation, setup, for the end. I know of none other that uses music as the distraction while doing this.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 3 Â– Worth watching.

Spoilers herein.

 How times change! I remember seeing this when it was new. It was stupid, lowbrow humor then -- as now. But then it was engineered to be smack in the middle of society's silliness. This was a time when it was sufficient to look stupid without simultaneously informing the audience of your intent. Glover and Pesci actually play this straight (which is to say that they are -not- straight men). Now it seems naive, juvenile. Not worth laughing at.

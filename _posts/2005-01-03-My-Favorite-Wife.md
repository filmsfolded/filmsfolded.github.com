Writing a movie is first a matter of engineering a solution to the fact that viewers both know they are in a movie and at the same time want to be swept up in the narrative. Many solutions fall into the category of "folding," a special study of mine. For about ten years, Hollywood experimented with the "screwball" fold.

This solution is based on situations where an actor plays a character has to dissemble: an actor playing a character who is acting. The screwball version of this lets us in on the joke at the beginning and always involves a comic situation (usually with unexpected consequences). This gives the writer the ability to create a more abstract situation, as goofy as you wish.

And it allows you freedom to build a brand around a contract actor, which was the main goal in those days. So here we have a rather mundane brick in the building of the Grant brand. He is involved in a game of avoiding reality with two women, and one of them (his first wife) feeds the game.

Grant does his job well enough, though he wasn't yet at the impeccably tailored state. The problem is the vehicle is poorly written: the second woman isn't engaged in the screwball world (though the second man is). It would have been fixable: she could have overheard the kids talking about their misunderstanding of the insurance investigation and believed Grant was trying to kill her.

These screwball things are hard to do. I think the genre burned out because you have to be more novel each time out. I see "Charade" as the culmination of the form: it is only partly screwball because we the audience is only let in on part of the comic dissembling.

Withnail is a terrific film, at root an excuse for actors to act as actors.

This adds another level, where we see those actors -- now much older -- as actors. The added depth is effective.

DVD extras are generally pretty bad, and often they damage a film. Why would someone assume that an actor knows much about a film? Why would someone assume that a director is articulate and honest enough to extend what he made?

But this works. It is a DVD extra wit "Withnal and I," though originally made for TeeVee.

What is so great is seeing how actorly these actors are, how much they are like Withnail minus the theatrics. This director also wrote "In Dreams," which is an under-appreciated, ambitious project, and "Killing Fields" which is probably overappreciated.

If you see "I," I very much recommend seeing "Us."

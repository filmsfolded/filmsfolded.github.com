Spoilers herein.

This is quality lowbrow entertainment.

The production itself is annoying: the play is not converted to cinema, merely filmed. The director doesn't have the energy it takes to drive the ideas behind this, slight though they are here. 

This could have been transformed into intelligent, deep material by an insightful director and more importantly multilevel acting. Self-aware ensemble synthesis could even have happened in the absence of a strong director because there are so few characters -- three, five or six depending on your philosophy of theater.

But alas, the whole thing is sunk by Will Smith, who is a naive actor: he probably believes the play is about a guy.

It could have been a play about great ideas and where they touch the soul through narrative -- and how they get watered down for convenience so destroy the soul. But we never get this because the play about narrative has been watered down from dimly visible great ideas into narrative itself.

See one of the Wallace Shawn efforts instead.

Spoilers herein.

I have just had quite an argument with a well known film critic. He maintains that films  are either good or bad and any good film is just simply good. I maintained that films are  little worlds. Some are created more successfully than others. Some are more novel or  clever or valuable than others. Navigating your way through film is part of building a life  worth living.

This film is a good example of what I mean. It is pleasant enough. It is well enough  brought into being. But it is damaged goods.

The situation is supposed to sharply display a late fifties environment of a man trapped  in a mechanical organization, having to cater to the norms of that organization with wit  and grace. The situation centers on sex. Now, after a few decades, it becomes clear that  Wilder himself was in the same situation. Early, he could make intelligent, edgy films.  "Sunset" is a masterpiece. But by this time, he was a chef in someone else's kitchen,  turning out perfect pastries. 

Lemmon and MacLaine do cute as well as anyone from that period.

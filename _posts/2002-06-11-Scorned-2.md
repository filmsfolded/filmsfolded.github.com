Spoilers herein.

Science fiction mentality. Imagine a world far away where men find this type of beast attractive, someone who has pumped up her breasts to comic proportions, has liposuction scars, whose lips vary in size as the jelly dissolves and who wears a Halloween wig.

Now imagine that she has amnesia, and that a PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR marries her. Are you in that far away place yet?

Okay, now suppose that this was really a psycho killer but she can't remember that she is. In fact, she was a violent, nympho drug addict.

In this world, there is an audience of nitwits who would be interested in a movie where she remembers her past and her violent erotic tendencies because of inexpert hypnotism and/or discovering her husband cheating with a student. At the same moment the father of her last victim appears, someone with whom she also was having sex.

That's the setup, which takes ever so long. We believe none of it, especially that there is an audience for such a film. There are a few simulated sex scenes, but these are so inexpertly done that it cannot be the point.

The real action of the film is her revenge: changing the student's grades, screwing her boyfriend then killing her. Also taking care of the investigating father (why would he do this?) and his wife. The hypnotizing psychologist gets it too and it all gets pinned on the hubby. Remember, this is supposed to be a really smart guy who understands the science of how people think and what motivates them.

Great science fiction.

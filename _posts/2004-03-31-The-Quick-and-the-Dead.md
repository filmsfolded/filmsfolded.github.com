Spoilers herein.

Every couple years, somebody takes another whack at bettering the post postmodern  western, or whatever they think the champion is. A common and to my mind

simpleminded strategy is to simplify and exaggerate around one component of the  genre, here the quickdraw showdown. This is in fact an element of the myth of the west  that is wholly fictitious.

Gene Hackman had already done an excessive bit for Eastman's more nuanced entry into  this contest. He reprises it here. Raimi is one of the more superficial "artsy" directors. He  and "I'm really a genius" Sharon Stone are well matched for this.

I have no complaint with cinematic excess. I think "Last Man Standing" is something of a  masterpiece in this subgenre. What I hate is sheer stupidity. This is blunt and stupid. It  should be shot.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

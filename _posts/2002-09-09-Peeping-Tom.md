Spoilers herein.

I am writing a book about films about films. After that, I'd like to do one on redheads in film (and how they season our notions of sex roles). This film will feature prominently in both; it is a very important event. Too bad it is not good or effective.

The self-reference is plain at the first level: it is a film about the film community, a (documentary) film about the making of a documentary. But it goes deeper: the reason for the filmmaker's obsession was because he was filmed himself; the reason for the victim's fear is that they saw themselves being filmed. Film as death. Pictures as sex. The camera as both self-revealer, sexual penetrator and weapon. Even the setup in the film-within has doubling: the standin is the one targeted. The girlfriend is a writer. The filmmaker is a 'focus-puller' which is a matter of determining what layer is clear.

So what's wrong? The primary problem is that filmmaker needs to be extraordinarily intelligent. Kubrick can and has done this. Soderbergh maybe. Tarkovsky surely. Powell just isn't up to it. But there are deeper problems that keep this from greatness.

The business about Freud. He is used as token for the way the world of the mind works. In fact, Freud was more a compelling storyteller than a scientist. His theories had more to do with 'making sense' in narrative than with developing new laws. Using a storyteller as the clockmaker for the story you are telling would have been a newly sweet and deep level of the self-reference, but Powell seems to have taken Freud quite seriously. Might have worked 40 years ago. Surely doesn't now.

But there is another problem. The British acting tradition is one of stepping into the character and representing the direct elements needed to move the story along. There's none of this North American conceit of 'becoming' the character and giving both the character and the actor's 'interpretation' of the character. That means that American actors have the basic capability to play multiple levels (usually irony) and British actors do not. It really hurts here, and my own opinion is that this attempt was what 'blacklisted' Powell after this film. He was messing with a self-interested tradition that simply squashed him.

The redhead thing really interests me. Obviously, there's something going on here: the actress and her standin; the girlfriend and her mother; the scarred model and the photographer himself are all redheads. My own theory is that redheads play roles that are more knowing than blonds and particularly so in just this type of cinematic self-reference. It surely holds here. I can't quite reconcile that with Massey's ridiculous chirp in reading the lines and have to suppose (from Babs in 'Frenzy') that it is just an artifact of some quaint British convention.

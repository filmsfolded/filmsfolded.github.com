Spoilers herein.

Standup is hard. So hard to be really funny instead of steering into the lazy blue zone. These women do. You might find it funny if you don't know its all about class -- funny isn't about laughing.

So hard -- if you are African American -- to not do the fatally patronizing: Black people are (fill in the blank with stereotypical behavior). All the Kings relied on this heavily. Only one of the Queens (the last) does, I suppose that makes this better.

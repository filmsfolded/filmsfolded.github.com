I saw this at the same time as "Finding Jane," and it struck me as positioning itself in the same space. Except Jane Austen actually lived. The idea here is to pretend that we are taking a step back from the stories, with all their quaint Victorianisms, and give us the real deal.

So we have promiscuous sex and drugs, explicit medical procedures, personal demons and a wholly modern approach to narrative and film.

Even when it fails it works, because we say no, the real Sherlock wasn't so and so.

Embedded in this is the famous Moriarty. He's updated as well. He's still the product of several generations of progressive evil. He's still in it for the buck, but this Moriarty will torture for the fun of it. There's no gentlemans' game of wits here. Moriarty is always a step ahead, but it seems to be just better planning and not some omniscient genius. 

Its not situated well for me. I would have made different choices so far as the sex is a part of the environment. In this case, he simply hooks up with one or two giggling women at a time. I think such a mind would find women with real souls and since at his level they would be exceedingly rare, there's be one. He would seek solace. He would probably have all sorts of mental phases: peaks and valleys of creativity and cleverness. These would certainly be linked to his relationship with this woman, and if the camera needs to bring sex into the picture, then it would be the most intense, sublime and deep in all the land.

Vincent is all wrong for Moriarty. Even in the most unrealistic of the traditional stories, he's superhuman and I mean that literally. He's transcendent, not fitting into the reality. He's responsible for nearly every evil you find in London and much of elsewhere. He's saturated that space that usually belongs to the author.

Vincent doesn't understand this, and plays an ordinary Mafia boss.

The bad: this is a simple theatrical character study. The situations and characters are rote, the unfurlment of emotions predictable. The directing is uninspired. DeNiro in my opinion has been uninteresting for decades -- his particular method is to find something in himself as the root of each character. The problem is that either he just doesn't have that rich a core or more charitably he mined it long ago.

But Hoffman makes this all worthwhile. He plays a prefabbed role, and he is clearly working with a relatively superficial director who is taking everything straight. Also, he is hampered in that DeNiro is struggling so much, he can't give space.

But Hoffman is a strange talent. He's not quite acting in the sense of becoming the character. Nor does he creep up on it through accomplished mimicry as, say Meryl Streep might. We know this because though the character is trite, Hoffman's person in the character is genuine. But it's not him, as we might get from Nathan Lane, or a long roster of stars who are always the same each time out, who essentially play themselves. (Think Harrison Ford.) And this is serious. He never winks at us as if to say 'see what I can do?'

This depth disturbs, quite apart from the film. I wonder what it costs him, and whether he will start to coast as dull fame descends. For now, I'll expect to see everything he does, and I recommend him in this.

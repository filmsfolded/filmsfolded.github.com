The previous year saw the "Phantom Empire" serial. Though it is all but forgotten now, it had a profound effect on movies. It mixed cowboys, radium, planes, scientists. It also had an underground civilization. In short order, studios produced a slew of cowboy science fiction movies, many with titles that copied "phantom" in some way. Most omitted the underground part.

This is one of them, and not particularly bad by the standards of the time. It ends with our cowboy hero and the presumably beautiful and plucky daughter of the just-saved scientist. She doesn't know who he is and says "can you give me your name," which he turns into a proposal.

I watched it only to see the effect of "Phantom." Otherwise, it isn't much of interest.

Sometimes you can find your moment of contact within a film, at some point or place or space within the film, inside the world of the story. But you are just as likely -- more -- to be touched by the idea of or about the film. Herzog does both for me, so is rare. He's rare as a competent German filmmaker. Twyker is the only other German I trust. And yes, that includes Lang, Fassbinder, Wenders, von Sternberg (if he counts).

Here's what I mean. There are moments in this that captivate by their clarity and truth. This isn't the best I know of his, several others come to mind. The one without Kinski is "Heart of Glass," made immediately before this. There are breathtaking moments in there. Quite, deep, sharp sewing. But its coupled with the idea of the movie, things you know outside the swim in fictional space. 

You know the two German nut job characters here are played by two genuine German nut jobs. The American goofs are genuine in their stew. The connections, the chicken, the light, the murders. All these are as found, with only the thinnest of stitching to collect them together. Its a sort of intellectual fearlessness that deepens the story with metastory. It allows us to add our own layer on top, as if we were one of the group, slapping hands in a pile before we voyage into territory unknown.

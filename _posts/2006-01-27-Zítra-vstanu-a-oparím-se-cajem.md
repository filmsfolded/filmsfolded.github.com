Here's a film that is improved by knowing its context. 

Czech films just aren't very good. It isn't that Czechs aren't clever or intelligent. And they do have a rich stage culture. But some cultures map cinematically and some don't. And those that do, map in different ways. Fascinating. 

However, this film has a very clever story. And it is more clever than it seems, because of the way we are spoonfed the answers. A man goes back in time to create a double, changing events. Its a bit elaborate, involving Hitler and latter-day Nazis, but that's beside the point.

The complexity is really about the doubles and working out the intercessions. Loves and affairs. Some clever humor here, similar to the Shakespearian bits about disguises.

It all ends well, and there is no puzzle, unlike, say "Primer." But wait! Actually there is. There's a hint that the fact that our hero has a twin is a result of the doubling, and that the events will repeat over and over again later.

I searched this odd film out in my quest for the quintessential Czech movie. This may be it. (The production values are poor.)

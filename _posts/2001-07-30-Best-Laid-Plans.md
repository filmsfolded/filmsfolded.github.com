Spoilers herein.

'Suicide Kings' meets 'Go.'

This is straightahead filmmaking. No self-referential baggage, no acting duels, not much cinematic mucking about. Everything is invested in the story, and one can see that there was a lot of promise here -- maybe even in earlier versions. But it seems to have been gutted, or perhaps the writer had neither the courage nor the skill to exploit the edge he approached.

Fear of undeserved death, evil events sweeping through your life, suspicion/obsession of your lover's rutting, instant recompiling of the universe, the pathos of surviving damaged humans recycled, revelations of the basic rot among friendships. Could have been strong stuff, especially the suspicion of pleasure/betrayal in the act and the real desire to kill her.

Watered down somehow. It is at once not enough to be visceral, and too much to be entertainment like 'Cruel Intentions.'

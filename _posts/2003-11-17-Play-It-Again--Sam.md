Spoilers herein.

Woody is a kingpin in the social phenomenon of folding in film. This is likely his first  essay. It is of historical interest only.

But what an interesting beginning! Allen starts with Casablanca's Bogart. 'Casablanca'  was the first film to have been engineered in response to 'Kane' of the previous year.

It is all about selfreferential observation. Everyone is studying everyone else, with the one  observer, Rick, sharing his observations with the viewers.

I have concocted a theory that speculates on abstraction 'distance.' The film within a film  is always the same level of abstraction than the host film is to life. I have hundreds of  examples in a database. Here is a clever extension of that rule: Woody adds a new layer  to an existing film and it also follows the rule.

Actually, he adds two levels: him as Woody on film, and him as Felix Allen, the catlike  observer of himself.

There's all sorts of distracting entertainment value here with a simple love story, and  slapstick. But that's just filler. The real reason for this to exist is to map life onto film,  and the other way around in a deeply self-aware manner.

Woody went on to do all sorts of similar experiments, most more sophisticated or subtle  than this. But this one has a simple purity that is interesting.

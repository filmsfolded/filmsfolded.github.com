Playwright G B Shaw called actors trained monkeys; Hitchcock later called them cattle. I always ask 'why did this movie get made?' Not why it got financed and distributed (which is obvious), but what purpose did the initiating sponsor have in mind?

In Hollywood, it is well established that the best films are driven by a director's vision, which vision is the template all the contributing skills are tailored around. But actors will have none of that; they don't like to be at the end of the food chain. Most film actors don't understand the media and fully believe that the entire endeavor revolves around them; many actors feel that they are the only 'real' component --- everyone else is support -- and they have a personality-obsessed public that backs them up and pays them obscenely. Transplanted TV actors are especially prone to this.

Every once in a while, we get an actor who just wants to prove the point in an open way. So we get 'Wag the Dog' about actors who literally drive the whole country. And we get this movie here, made by actress Bonnie Hunt to show that craft acting is the thing, the only thing. You may enjoy the fruits of these competent actors and their practiced timing; I laughed and cried when I was supposed to, but then I always repeated the Pledge of Allegiance as a kid and still feel patriotic when that button is pushed. It is matter of superficial training only.

This film has no story, only a situation. It has no notable film maker skills at all except for the acting, in which all is invested. And -- as we are constantly reminded -- that should be enough. Actors are the 'heart' of a picture, and a good heart will remake an otherwise obedient but unremarkable picture, here a wallflower.

(Caution: by a big stretch, the following could be considered a spoiler because so little happens)

--The only action in the film is that a lush stage gets built for a gorilla who has been taught 'sign language' by the original owner of the heart. Here, we are also given a cartoon of the dumb, self-congratulating film financier.

--Our hero (surrogate for Hunt) is a construction superintendent (a performing artist) which the film conveniently and deliberately blurs with the real creative artist, the architect. At one point, the two stand on 'his' first building and say 'we can see all this because of something you built.' This hero creates the monkey's stage to honor the actor's 'heart.'

Notice how our chorus of widowers (who here represent the effete other film trades) repeatedly obsess over the best performers (not writers or arrangers) of songs?

Along the way, we are treated to two Hollywood totems: the perfect professional Black guy; and the extreme stereotype of the obsequiously pious Irish Catholic, and his confused priest. (This affect dates from the Legion's blacklist; since then Catholicism has been portrayed in successively silly, and sadly true, fashion.)

You should see this film. It works in the same space as the execrable Julie Roberts fluff. Both her films and this take themselves seriously, but at least here we have some self-reference as to the mission. We can see why the film got made.

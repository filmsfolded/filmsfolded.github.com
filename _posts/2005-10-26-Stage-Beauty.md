Nearly all my viewing these days is from recommendations by readers of my comments. About two dozen of them recommended this because my interest is "folded" movies. For instance, this is a play made into a film about an actor playing an actor who is a man playing a woman, who by the end plays a woman playing a man.

And it is done with the kind of intellectual self-reference that I admire. There are lots of self- referential lines, and the thing is built around Othello, who Welles turned into our first folded film Shakespeare.

Lots of commentors write about the ordinary values in a film, so I concentrate on the folding alone. And that gives the impression I don't value the delivery of an immediate experience. In particular, I have a dear friend who truly understands acting and whose first value film has to do with whether actors touch her. She points out the dryness of folding with no blood.

So the comment this time will be on how perfectly the folding merges with and is supported by the acting. It all works as it is supposed to, with the complex structure baring your soul 

Storiwise, this is halfway between the overproduced "Shakespeare in Love," and the mawkish "The Dresser." (It has an inside joke about "The Dresser" in the Lear carrying scene.)

But it all centers on the actors' physicality and how that physicality surrounds words. The actual story is about that as well: it starts with one approach to actors' physicality with text and moves at the end to another approach that grabs you and pulls you out of your seat. You see the on screen audience behave the same way.

Its due mostly to the way Crudup understands and embraces the intent of the filmmaker, and how that director reshapes everything to be carried by the actor. Claire Danes hasn't impressed me in the past, but here she is the ground from which Crudup flies. So she is supposed to be emotionally flat in her projection (as is her character) and translucently beautiful. It works.

Eyre's last project was much more ambitiously folded, containing two threads from the life of Iris Murdoch played by two different actresses. The intent was to have them create a shared being even though they never had scenes together. One of our greatest folding actresses, Kate Winslet was involved, but bossy Judi Dench would have none of those "modern ideas." So the film failed.

Kate was to have been the girl here but backed out at the last minute, just as the story indicates, and Claire stepped in.

An added fold: Billy and Claire really did become real world lovers, with Billy leaving his pregnant girl friend. There's that idea again: fearless acting.

Smart words, folding, Shakespeare, sex, immediacy and potency in acting, apt energy in the camera. What else could one want?

I think of John Waters as a sort of Ed Wood impersonator, someone conscious of what he does and someone who has good intuitions about the source material, or what he thinks that is.

He is boring as heck when he tries to build a show that says something, because alas, he isn't smart enough to know or say something marginally interesting. Think of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch." It works because it is show about a show, more: it is about precisely the kind of show it is.

Waters is at his best when he makes shows about his kind of show: "Pecker," "Cecil B Demented" (my favorite) and "hair Spray" all work because of this. They still may not be something that interests you, but they do work. They are perfect impersonations of something done by someone who is already the the person impersonated.

Now this. It has the amazing Tracy Ullman who does her best to make sexual humor in a film with no sexual content or element that you would normally associate with sex. No nudity, for example which makes this the strangest of impersonations. 

Try to impersonate Elvis without any of the things you normally associate with him and see what you get.

So some of the otherwise clever things in this fall flat. Too bad, that business of the 12 apostles of depravity was promising.

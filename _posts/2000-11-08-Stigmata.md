This film had some raw possibility: Matrix-like MTV pacing and a plot about suppression of the "true" gospel by the bad old Vatican.

It could have worked, even been good. but it fails on both levels. The filmmaking just isn't effective. It doesn't transport, even if you limit that to scaring. The stylishness is mimicry without a soul.

But what's worse is the miss in the story. 

SPOILER:

What we have is a priest who discovers a lost gospel that in Jesus' words recommends against a Church. The priest is killed (?) and because some woman ends up with his rosary, that priest's soul comes back to express the gospel. How stigmata figures in this is unexplained, especially since their appearance supports organized religion.

How droll. Especially when we DO have Essene scrolls that likely are closer to Jesus' teachings than Paul's sanctimony. How cool this would have been as a battle between Paul's ghost and say Peter's. What sides would spiritual forces choose? What traditions would come into play and how much magic exists in the faith of people regardless of what Jesus actually taught? This would be bigger than any old Vatican (which is dwarfed in holdings by the Mormons by the way).

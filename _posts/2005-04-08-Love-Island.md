I have the most amazing luck. My movies-to-watch stack is a couple hundred high, many of them mysteries to me. I chose two at random to watch tonight, this one and "Legong: Dance of the Virgins."

As it turns out, both are based in Bali. This movie has three settings: a few beach scenes, clearly shot in California; some really cheesy studio sets, and inserts taken from "Legong." The selections from "Legong" must have been a real trial to find footage without any topless women. And where the 1935 original is in glorious color, this presents it in black and white. 

I'm a real critic of "Mystery Science" nags when applied to science fiction movies because the nature of the genre demands suspension of disbelief. But this project enters a world that actually exists, and climaxes in perhaps the most amateurish, even buffoonish fight ever filmed. Truly dreadful.

Eva Gabor, still with Hungarian accent, plays the Balinese beauty in a "me Jane" sort of movie English usually reserved for Native Americans. She's not appealing.

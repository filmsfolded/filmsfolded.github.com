Not only do they not make them like this any more, they never did. I'd like to recommend this to you for reasons different than the effusive comments of others that surround this one.

And it has -- my reason has -- little to do with the fact that it features two elderly actresses that have been celebrated in the past. In fact, the best performance is by the third woman in the household, the housekeeper, by an actress that also holds office in that somewhat repellent Imperious Order of the Empire.

My reason for recommending the film has to do with a particular acting style. The notion here is that it is not so important what you say, or even how you say it. Nor does it matter so much if you "find" the character according to whatever technique you've learned. What matters is all the things you think and do that surround the thing, all those things. All the incidentals that AREN'T important are the things that are.

Dance is an actor after this manner, and he has shaped this film accordingly. It is, therefore a rare thing. I can only recall one other in this tradition right now, "Withnail &amp; I."

It shows in the acting of course. I've read those that suppose he as a new director must have just let the two experienced stage biddies loose. But watch closely. You'll see Dench do something I have never seen her do. She is different, less forceful. Oh, I don't mean her character is, but that she doesn't fill it in a way that projects past the back seats. She has been carefully coached by an actor to avoid her worst enemy, the actor that haunts her.

But that's much less interesting than what Dance has filled the screen with. Only a third of what you see cinematically supports the story: of two women and a younger man. The other two thirds surrounds the story in apparently irrelevant ways.

Pay attention. This is the extreme opposite of the conventional wisdom. In a Hitchcock movie, if you see a knife somewhere in a shot, rest assured that it will figure in the story later. In a Ron Howard movie (if you have the stomach) there is no scene that doesn't drive the narrative. If you watch a Mamet project, you become aware that every syllable is tuned to be part of the locomotive that pulls his narrative.

This is different, truly different. One example. Our hero has come "home" drunk after revealing to the village that he is a musical genius, and also after meeting the "witch" in the story. What happens next? 

We expect some dramatic turn or punctuation directly following. Instead, we have a fairly elaborate scene of the housekeeper coming to work. Her way is blocked by cows. She has an encounter with the guy in charge and all sorts of hints spread out like tentacles of other stories that overlap and that we will never fully see. When she finally comes in, she performs certain chores that in another project would MEAN something.

Earlier we see an extended search by this woman for a specific kind of fish for a pie, one not normally used. There are missteps in this strategy: an elaborate harvesting scene obviously appears because the machine is available for filming. A ruined tower has an "explanation" attached just so that we'll notice it.

But generally, the extra stuff, the non-story stuff (most of which is without Dench and Smith) is rich, worth the trip in a Robbe-Grillet sense.

Dance incidentally uses a technique of slowing the camera ever so slightly from time to time, Its damned effective and fits this notion of broken flows.

In some productions of "The Tempest" our sea-faring travelers are cast into swirling stormwaters and as they are drowning, they imagine what we see as the play. You can see that here in the elaborate beginning. Later we see Dench's character dreaming of meeting the man and passionately rolling in a meadow.

But in this earlier segment we see a lost soul imagining he is a great violinist and having the great adventure that ends in pure movieland fashion.

Thank heavens for Tim Burton. He knows how to make movies. Many people do. But how many do it by having an original notion, a specific, genuinely original tone and then project that into the machinery we have to make movies. Someone like him needs to fight at every step, something that someone like Spielberg just flows with.

So he needs to be supported, rather like Woody Allen, no matter what.

But sometimes he will surprise. For me, those surprises come in small bits, usually parts of movies. 

This little thing is so perfectly conceived though. Other than "PeeWee," and "Corpse" this is the only project where the scope of the thing is larger than the timespan.

Plus it has a simple self-referential caste: Vincent the boy who wishes to be Vincent Price, in a story narrated by Vincent himself. A movie about a life about movies, A movie by Burton about the young Burton. An antiSeuss, using the Seuss cadence.

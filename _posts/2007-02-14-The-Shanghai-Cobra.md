The Chan series gives few pleasures. But you can find them if you want.

This has two features to recommend it. One is a rather incredible opening scene, with much more mystery and puzzle than usual for any detective movie of the type. It includes something that I have never seen before. I have no idea if such a thing actually existed. Its a jukebox with a sort of tunnel TeeVee camera in it with a girl at the other end in an office. Sort of a video switchboard operator and DeeJay. She can literally see through the front of the jukebox. Its a truly strange notion. See it for that.

The second interesting feature is that the victims are killed in an elaborate way, using cobra venom and hidden needles that are a marvel of technology.

All else is typical Chan, workmanlike and ordinary.

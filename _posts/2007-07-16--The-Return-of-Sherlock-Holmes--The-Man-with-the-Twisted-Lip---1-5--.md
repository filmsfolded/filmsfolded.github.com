Some of these episodes are barely tolerable. This is one of the worst ones, and the blame isn't completely the fault of the adapters. This is simply a bad Sherlock Holmes story.

It shouldn't come as a surprise. The author hated writing them. He had a few templates, some more engaging than others. One template simply played with disguise. Holmes or some nemesis would put on makeup and create a story within the story. Since Holmes' talent was to be deeply introspective, this could have worked better than it does.

Conan Doyle just never found the right way to exploit the idea, even though he often had his disguised villains be actors. Here he is someone with actorly training who spouts Shakespeare. So the raw material for connected folding of the story within is possible.

Anyway, we have a reoccurring fascination with the hallucinogenic drug scene. We find Holmes in disguise. This is mirrored later in what we discover of the suspected murderer. He is in fact the presumed victim in disguise.

This possibly was enough of a plot twist in its day to carry a weak story. It is not today.

What saves this adaptation is the enhancement of the missing man's wife. The Holmes stories understand the iconic value of redheads. In Victorian Britian, this would have been a stronger type than in the modern west, simply because redheads are more numerous and associated with "colonies;" Scotland and Ireland.

A redheaded woman in society carried a story about class, origin, behavior, that is not so apparent today. Nevertheless, every adapter of Holmes understood this and here we have a very compelling redhead, played by Eleanor David.

She completely drives this story, handily eclipsing Holmes, who is reduced to one of those Scooby Doo moments where Watson casually says something and Holmes jerks straight in his chair. Its an excrescence.

But the woman was fine, and her presence shows that the adapters struggled with the thing.

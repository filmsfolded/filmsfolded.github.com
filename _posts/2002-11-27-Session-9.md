Spoilers herein.

There's the institution of acting and another of filmmaking. Both require madness, but of different types. The problem with this film is that we have too much of one and not enough of the other.

Actors like the notion of possession, especially when imposed by the environment, and most intensely when it involves deceptions among fellow actors. One can contrive some interesting effects with just this, but you cannot make a film with it. And you certainly cannot make the type of film whose destabilizing motive comes from the environment rather than the character.

What's attempted here is something along the lines of 'Blair Witch,' where the spookiness comes from the distrust of the camera. In particular, the idea is that the narration has been honked around: not only can you not trust what you see, but the hapless characters are living in that broken world. Pretty sophisticated stuff. 

Now in the mob that follows 'Blair' these guys take an approach where the environment is taken literally. This has a long tradition. It's more than just a haunted house as a character: its that the house/character has power enough to perturb the psyche, a la 'Shining.' And what an opportunity this old building offers! But watch what they do with it. In such situations, the building is supposed to have eyes and those eyes are both shown to us and somehow mixed with our own eyes. For a good example of this sort of building-god see the recent, clever 'Attic Expeditions.'

'Session 9's' original script did this through the surrogate of the homeless woman, who ultimately claims the soul of the person 'created' by its magic. She sees and is seen. She collects parts of them to add to her environment. She manipulates the discovered trove. She stands in the film projection booth at the end (a direct quote from 'Cinema Paradiso'). Because the film has problems, all this was excised. But the problems are that the director never understood the space, never situated the evil properly in the space. An example of a cinematographer who knows how to do this is Gilliam's man, Roger Pratt, who just made an architectural film out of Harry Potter's Chamber.

Nonetheless, the film didn't read, so instead of fixing it to take advantage of the space as demon, they just cut out all the intelligent stuff and left all the actorly stuff. Now it is just a workshop.

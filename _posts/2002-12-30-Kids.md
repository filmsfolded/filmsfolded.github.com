Spoilers herein.

Larry Clark is a photographer, the ordinary kind who creates a single artifact (the image) that has collected all sorts of power from its situation and ours.

Film is large enough to accommodate this vision, though not well. What we have is a film that is solely a collection of images of growing power that feed the scene at the end.

It is all a matter of situating us and setting us up. I admit it worked for me, but only as a single photograph. Film is so much more, and both Clark and Korine have gone on to make highly watchable films ('Bully' and 'Gummo'). Those are films.

Chloe is slightly redhead here: Kim (Michele Lockwood) more so.

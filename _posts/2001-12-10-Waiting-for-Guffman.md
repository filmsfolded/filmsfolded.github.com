Spoilers herein.

There is a difference between a cinematic sensibility and a TeeVee one. Cinema is rooted in the visual vocabulary; TeeVee is personality-based, skit-centered. One is stained glass, the other comic book.

Skits can be funny, and this sometimes is. But why? If all you are doing with your life is filling space, this is amusing filler.

'Drop Dead Gorgeous' takes a half step toward cinema and is an interesting study.

Of the many films of this type (shows about shows), 'Illuminata' is an example of something more real. Or if you want a laugh-your-ass-off cult film, try 'The Falls' which this film quotes.

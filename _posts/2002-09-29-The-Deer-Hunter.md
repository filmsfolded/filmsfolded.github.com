Spoilers herein.

I admire films well done, and this is certainly one. But it succeeds only by attempting something so simple one wonders if it is worth the emotional investment of the audience. I think I prefer projects like 'Thin Red Line' which also put you through the wringer but can transform your soul.

The simple thing here is to focus on situation as the driver of the story. The actors (fine actors mostly) form an ensemble that responds. This is radically different than the typical DeNiro picture which has it the other way around. It is the only DeNiro performance I credit as tolerable because he subordinates his presence to the vision of the filmmaker. He does do that with others (notably Scorsese) but in their case, their vision is entirely bounded by the character, so we watch him grimace and prance intently and are supposed to be amazed.

The situation here is an America that breaks its people. Quite bleak. The situation shifts to and from Vietnam and the actors react, but there is no mistake that they were terminally damaged before the first scene. The changing situation is like the revolver's chambers, that bullet will appear in one of them. Randomly.

In producing the film, sound is used effectively. Again, it is a simple effect (the framing of the church choir) but done well.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

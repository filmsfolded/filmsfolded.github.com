Spoilers herein.

Its all in the rhythm.

If you watch this on DVD, turn off the sound. They've added a Shostokovich score with the best of intentions. The music is Russian and neoromantic, but the film is not. Instead, it carries the tone of fabricated realities in the way it folds time in petty ways.

It is subversive: apparently with chaotic underpinnings but instead with a deeply intellectual, antiprole eye. ('We must master the Lenin-Stalin method of perceiving reality and history ...') Since the heroism is so exaggerated it is thus reduced, even given the time.

And time is what is manipulated here, in pretty radical fashion. Small shuffles back and forth of the same sequence often with radical shifts in perspective; recurrence of a prior image in a new context; heavy use of incongruous inanimate objects in contrast to motion (today, that would be slomo or zipps); a very studied rhythm of motion and perspective....

Consider this: the Soviet State is dead, less than a century later. But film -- especially the notions of film espoused here -- may live eons longer. I suspect that the notions of open vision established here are inherently democratizing, so the propagandistic nature of his films is irrelevant.

(The title of this comment refers to the only major living filmmaker (I know) who would use this petty folding of time so: Soderbergh in 'The Limey.' Many have copied the lighting and angles, most shamelessly Spielberg in his Schindler faces.)

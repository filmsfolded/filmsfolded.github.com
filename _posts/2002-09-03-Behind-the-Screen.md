Spoilers herein.

The world's best filmmakers (to my mind: Welles, Tarkovsky, Kurosawa) thought Chaplin among the world's best. And usually we think they mean the films of 1925-40, over which he labored and in which he controlled nearly every aspect. But I think the earlier ones have tremendous cleverness and energy as well -- even genius that embodied more risk in the type of humor. That's because by 1925, he was already worrying over what was funny, but a decade earlier was just intuitively _being_ funny and in a sometimes more incisive manner.

Sure, this one has piethrowing. And lots of pratfalls. And the standard class commentary. But it has -- for the first time I know -- some fairly sophisticated humor about itself. After all, the thing that made Chaplin's later work so deep was its self-awareness and the trunk of that tree is self-reference. So I consider this film, right here, to be the birth of modern film humor.

Oddly, this film is accessible on DVD as an extra on the execrable 'Cat's Meow,' whose story involves a Chaplin-like character. That film is the converse of self-reference: is supposed to be (in fact has all its value in) self-reference but is not.

This creepy thing did not quite work for me; there is too much cultural distance. The story has a double twist with heavy ambiguities and I just could not keep up through the subtitles. You need that surprised awareness of reinvented narrative to get the full creepy value out of this.

But I did get the extremely balanced sense of place. It is a hallmark of certain Korean filmmakers that they seem to understand how to take a story that can be anchored to a place, and use the place to tell the story. This is all about crevices and corners having agency, shadows creating beings, hidden things made real by their occlusion. The place literally attacks the people, a ghost story with effectively no ghost -- just a place that yearns.

It is not as profoundly sweeping and disturbing as XXX, which features twin sisters, one of whom burns the other to death while locked in a basket. But it is creepy stuff. We fear place more than we fear anything else, which is why -- I suppose -- hell features so prominently in modern fundamental extremism.

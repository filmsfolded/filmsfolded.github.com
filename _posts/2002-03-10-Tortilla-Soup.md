Spoilers herein.

See this back to back with the original by Ang Lee. And marvel at the difference that a director with vision and control can make. Filmmaking is a lot like cooking -- there are intricate subtleties that make a world of difference.

It's no mistake that Ang Lee has the number 27 IMDB rated film of all time.

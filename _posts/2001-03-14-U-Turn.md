Spoilers herein.

Stone had potential. 'Platoon' was raw. 'JFK' was deft. But this is such a miss, there must be drugs involved.

Here's the problem, I think. Stone really believes we are all hillbillies and any vision he might have must be interesting. Sorta works when he has a 'message' and he's interested in how we feel. Then we willingly meet him halfway.

Here we have a condescending, pretentious collection of effects that do not coalesce. 'Red Rock' meets 'Fargo' meets 'Deliverance.' I have just seen Penn's 'The Pledge,' which shows mastery of focus and some breadth. Of directing, Penn said that Stone was pig, and because of it had to make bad films. Stone thinks actors are just meat, and Penn is an irascible SOB, so you might not trust that statement until you see this.

If he wants to play Coen, he has to think of himself as one of us, watching the joke of life cook. This territory is no place for superiority, which is why this film is about itself. Just as Bobby has no control over his work, so with Stone.

As to the acting, Voight and Thornton are too far into parody. Clearly Voight are Nolte are trying, but Billy Bob makes up his own by now worn out character. Lopez just cannot act and her only asset is photographed unflatteringly here.

Danes impresses me. Both she and Phoenix seem to find a center for at least their scenes and both are internal actors (like Nolte and Penn). I think Penn is a remarkable talent; he can play several levels simultaneously. But Stone is a straightahead guy. So Penn is asked to have one perspective here, another there, and on and on as Stone tries some 'Limey' - like timeshifting.

Penn and Nolte went together shortly after this to make 'The Thin Red Line.' Watch that to see an interesting contrast in effectiveness from these two. (Then Penn made the amazingly multilevel 'Sweet and Lowdown.')

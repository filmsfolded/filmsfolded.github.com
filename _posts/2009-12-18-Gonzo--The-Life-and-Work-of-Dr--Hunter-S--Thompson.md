Hunter Thompson's gift was to fall gracefully into chaos. He didn't always do well in this, and rarely do movies that reference him in any way.

You can only approach this world of righteous anarchy in one of two ways. You can stand outside it and draw it as informed disorder, or you can try to go with the flow scribbling blind, surfing unseen cultural fields that you make visible. Only Gilliam with Depp has been able to dissolve Gonzo with value. All else who try fall off their skateboards.

This takes the other route: straight interviews and archival footage, assembled as if it really could say something about what happened. The result is so off the mark that it flattens a whole era, erases the very spidery traces that Thompson teased into visibility. This is a film that destroys its subject because of a vast misunderstanding. It is easy to do, since the man himself was too doltish to know what he did when it worked.

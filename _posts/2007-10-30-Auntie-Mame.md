A truly interesting production, this. First, its a filmed stage show, so the lines are better polished than usual, and it features its original stage player. It isn't just the lines and a certain staginess that are carried over, but two specific stage effects. One is the damping of all lights at the end of a scene except those on Mame's face. The other is the reuse of Mame's apartment over the twenty-five years, changing the decor. It serves the double purpose of showing time has moved and displaying her supposed caprice.

Its interesting because it is folded: It is a movie of a play of a book by the nephew (who is featured in the thing) of his Aunt who also writes a book, recording what we have seen and incidentally triggering the climax of what we see.

And its also interesting because of the main device. The world here is divided into three parts. There are the bumpkins, naturally from the south and only have money by accident (here oil). They are simple people and largely good, except for a jealous redhead.

There are the enlightened, like Mame, who know what life is all about and know how to grab it. But she's actually depicted as a sort of nitwit, one of those dumb, moneyed women who wear big jewelry and give parties in their east side apartments. Their enlightened state is that they have "interesting" people at their parties. Mame does redeem herself a tiny bit at the end in doing one unselfish thing: combating prejudice. 

You see, the third type are the uptight, moneyed crowd who are boring, simpleminded and prejudiced. Here, they have an obsession with living a "restricted" life in restricted places. At the time, that meant no Jews, blacks and immigrants being sufficiently well controlled I suppose.

Mame's notion of Jews is rather one-dimensional, it seems: Jews are artistic and clever. But in the end, she wins over the bad class and seduces her nephew (who remember, is writing this part) into a "satisfactory" marriage. 

I know women like this, and they are every bit as much of a scourge, and very, very much like the people they belittle because the patterns are the same. Only the long cigarette holder is different.

There is one hint of true radicalism here, and I'm surprised it made it into the film. The preteen nephew is sent to an experimental school where the children and teachers are nude and the kids are taught and practice sex.

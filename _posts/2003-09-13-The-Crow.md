Spoilers herein.

Some films are all style - the most interesting of these invents or attempts to.

That's why this one is interesting. It exists so that the character can: he brings reality to  a sort of tilted world, and that world creates some bad guys and situations.

This was back when edgy metal could actually be interesting, and before dopes affected  barbed wire tattoos. Its a simple story: revenge, church towers, amenable black cop. And  a simple style: Gothic cosmology - goodness disguised darkly, turning the wheels of  natural justice. Could have been a western, and was. Before.

Preteens find minor profundities in this script and latch onto them. But oddly, they  overlook the clever "Bible-as-pawned-goods" notion. (The Gideon Society is the world's  largest distributor of Bibles.)

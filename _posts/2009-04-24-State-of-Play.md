We like stories, but we like stories about stories more. The evidence is all around, and one obvious place are the three metastory genres: detective, courtroom and reporter dramas. In each case, we have a story always based on the notion of absolute truth. We have a surrogate storyteller who doggedly finds and presents the story dramatically at the end in spite of many attempts to spoof that truth.

So we end up with the story and a metastory. This is a uniquely America thing and forms the basis for many more elaborate narrative folding techniques. Every once in a while however, we need to have the basic form repeated.

The newspaper genre has a few essentials. The dedicated reporter of course who has this holy mission to uncover the truth and who has a visceral aversion to printing rumor. We'll have the seasoned editor, who just like the detective's surly boss is our surrogate who has to be convinced that what we think we have seen is not true. Clever stories take advantage of this role, but the newspaper genre is more pure. The twist with the Perry White type is that he/she is part of a corporation that is perturbing the truth, either deliberately because the owners are co- conspirators, or because of simple desire to sell papers by printing any compelling story regardless of truth.

And we always have the cub reporter -- also our surrogate. While the main reporter is us discovering the main story, the assistant is us discovering the metastory of its discovery.

Oh, and the deadline. There's always a deadline we share. We know we will be sitting in our seats for a limited time and the guy has to do his discovery before we leave. This is denoted by the "held press" who we literally see at the end delivering the story. In between the mystery at the beginning and the delivery of the truth at the end is a rushed pace which actors love because it allows snappy exchanges.

We have all this here, served up as a franchise meal; the shape is disappointingly ordinary. The engagement is supposed to be in the feints and thrusts of the story; and our surprise at the twist at the end. A problem is that the twist is ordinary. You might not see it coming, but you are certain it will; and when it does you will feel that it comes from a stockpile like all the rest of the plot. Bigger problems are that the parries, the flow of the shifting stories don't capture us because none of them are clearly enough supported to engage.

Crowe plays a single reporter who has had an affair with the wife of the congressman who is involved as a storytwister. He -- we are indicated -- has also had an affair with his female boss, played by Mirren, and soon will with his new partner Rachel McAdams. Each of these three stir the story against him, but none of these twists are made clear enough for us to follow them. We do know that the congressman does divert the truth, but we get only the smallest confirmation of this, and nearly none of the story -- though we see the headlines at the end.

Its the wife, played by the strong Robin Penn who is the main element, and the main mystery. We are supposed to get engaged in her needs, her emptiness and passion, her memories and desires. We are supposed to understand at the end that she was devious and manipulative. But none of this is developed well. We know she could have done it, were it not for incompetent writing and directing. I believe some crucial scenes were cut for some reason, probably a focus group's confusion.

But you still might want to see this mess, because its interesting what Crowe does. Elsewhere, I have noted that he is a special talent. Good actors focus on understanding and delivering a character. Mirren does this. Crowe instead focuses on understanding the dynamics of the film and in presenting his character supports those dynamics. I first noticed this in "Gladiator" where Scott leaned into the next scene, giving the picture energy. Here, he has a less aware director, but you can see him saturating the environment round him. He is not what they call a generous actor -- he requires the other actors to grab their space as Mirren does. But what he does is different, Australian.

Dreamworks would be years away from making a watchable movie. But this has one thing that really appealed.

The characters and gags are designed by committee, and thoroughly tested, as is the game with SKG. But one craft is the work of a single master. We don't know who it is, because Hans Zimmer's massive operation did the music and some uncredited person put this together. (I think.)

Whoever, whether Sunny Park or someone in in a Zimmercube, we are treated to possibly three dozen themes from old movies. All of them are quoted in a more pure fashion than the original, all with great respect and all adding substance to the film that it otherwise lacks. This is hard to do, to judge from how rarely it is even attempted.

Cohen has a few funny jokes. The rest is pap.

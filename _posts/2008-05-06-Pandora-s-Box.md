There are a couple remarkable things about this film.

One category has to with how well it is made. In its day as now, it was a remarkable story. Its simple but full of richness, in the story itself, its subtle embellishments, cinematic vocabulary and expressive photography. These are things we share across the ages, now about 80 years. 

Louise Brookes would have stunned then as now, but there's an additional dimension now. What I would call an external fold. 

She's luminous, virtually unique and probably never to be bested, because silents were better suited to exploit a dancer's grace, bodily freedom and physical beauty. That would have registered then, and did. But we now know about this special woman.

We know she has an openness, a sexual openness and trusted casualness with fate on screen because that's the way she was in life. We know this. We know its why she is an effective Lulu. And we know what happened to her. We know she WAS the mistress of a powerful man, and at the same time played freely. We KNOW that though she may have been among the smartest minds to blow through Hollywood, she was addicted to passion, and bored with Hollywood. Bored with Hollywood!

That she suffered. That she indeed became a prostitute and drunk. We know that the Louise we essentially fall in love with suffers because of how we fall in love with her. And that makes this an entirely different experience that no one in the 30's could have had. Its an experience full of tears. And shame of passion that makes this one of the deepest films you'll see.

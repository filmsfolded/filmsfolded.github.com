Spoilers herein.

Of the current spate of detective thrillers, this one shoots the highest.

It is very poorly executed. It's not just Bullock who is dreadful -- the whole production is cursed with people without the ability to put their minds inside ours. So just forget about digging into this at face value. But the underlying notion is so rich, you can watch it as if it were radio and fill in all the art yourself.

And that's more fun with this type of material anyway. The legacy of this is an engagement of wits between the writer and reader, each trying to outwit the other. Somewhere since then, the genre has become dominated by a new version with two new twists.

First, the criminal becomes not just a player in the drama, but is involved in a struggle for creating that drama. In this, the criminal mind is engaged in crime not just for whatever benefit the crime gives, but also to manipulate the detective. Its a remarkably modern notion that often spills outside the boundaries of the play to control some part of the viewer's mind. Spacey's character in 'Seven' had a goal not just to flummox the detectives but us as well. The crime is one of breaking the shell of personal control over our consciousness. That's Neitzsche. The real Neitzche. 

That's also the idea behind 'Fight Club,' the really cool notion that by showing the ability to mess with a displayed mind, the filmmaker could -- by display -- mess with your mind. 'Fight Club' had some actors that knew how to play this double role: tussling between each other and also tussling for control of our mind. No one here has a clue about this agenda.

The second evolution in the genre is the introduction of 'psychological' factors. Though the ostensible dynamic is to add interest to the characters, the real intent in intelligent work is to allow the environment to also be involved in the struggle over people's lives. So Cassie has a past that haunts her. Each of these boys is a product of their environments. The girl too for that matter.

'Fight Club' was clean -- in fact its logo was that bar of soap, remember? This project isn't. Multiple pulls are set up in the narrative:

-- One boy over another using psycho sexual mesmerism. The big twist is that the roles are discovered to be opposite of what is set up.

-- The pair of boys as a team pulling against the world, embodied by the insatiably curious Cassie. She has a pathological need to discover the "truth." Its not well rationalized by the standards of the genre, but there she is.

-- Cassie pulling against the consciousness of her own world: partners, bosses.

-- The ensemble of them pulling us first one way and then other.

This is not as deft as it needs to be on their part, which is why it has a hidden charm: the viewer can actually WIN! A talented viewer can engage in this contest for control over the world of the town shown. And because everyone involved is so incompetent, that viewer can get in there and grab control, can turn this movie into something that makes sense and has a coherent philosophical weave.

What I saw was something fabricated by the Sam Kennedy character. He controls the broken Cassie character through sex and Richard, and completely drives the poor Justin by suggestion. Both incrementally believe they actually did it. Its a double fight club. We see this through TWO sets of delusional eyes: one thread through the fooled Cassie: the other through the kids.

As with 'Moulin Rouge,' their susceptibility is via absynthe primarily and dope (numbers) secondarily. Watch it again and you'll see how fabricated is the narrative. Great radio.

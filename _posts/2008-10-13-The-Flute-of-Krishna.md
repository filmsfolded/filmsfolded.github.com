Sometimes you seek things out expecting miracles.

I know a dancer trained by someone trained by Martha Graham. What she says of what she learned touches me deeply, and you can see it in nearly every move, even every move not made.

Martha choreographed this for a "studio" known for its casual approach. And I knew the original photography and print would be good, so I expected something special.

It is not. I can only believe that she was marginally involved with this, or was constrained in some way. If a passion of yours is dance in film, and you seek either excellence in dance or in how dance is filmed, don't bother to seek this out.

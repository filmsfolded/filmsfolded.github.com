Most commentors on this make reference to the fact that sides are not taken in the war. From my perspective, the war is merely there to allow for great social turmoil and narrow military control, enabling a plot device.

One last train is leaving before the military destroys the tracks. Being left behind is near certain death while getting on the train could mean escape to anywhere in the world. This setup allows us to follow a half dozen unrelated stories. The production values are remarkably high, and the acting rather effective. Most viewers will consider the stories overly dramatic in shape.

What impressed me wasn't any one of these stories, but the amazing variety. These were not just different situations and characters, they were stories told in different manners. I see the credits, but the impression you get from this is that eight or nine of the studio's senior writers were each given an opportunity to write a situation. The shifting from one to the other in the film is artless, having no significance.

What I mean by being told differently: each couple (usually a couple) has different internal causal drivers. Each of these stories comes to us by leveraging those drivers in different ways. It is really quite remarkable and overall gives the feeling of complexity and human depth.

One story is worth mentioning by itself. A female soldier is among a group being sent to certain death. She runs from her unit and talks someone into driving her to see her father. He is in prison and scheduled to be executed that day for political reasons. Her ride, as it happens, is an American reporter. He does take her to the prison and arranges a visit. But he is able to fool the daughter into believing that her father has gotten a reprieve. They have a quiet visit until he is called away, unbeknownst to her to be killed.

The couple leave and get holed up overnight in a wine cellar. The American gets sweetly drunk. The couple has been slowly falling in love. When he awakes, he is told that he confessed his love and they got married. He tries to undo the error. She leaves, heartbroken. He has discovered a letter she wrote while he was asleep telling her father about her new love and the shared future of the three. Eventually they are reunited; he obtains the rare passes for a seat on the train and they rail off to a happy future. She may never know what happened to her father, we think.

She is played with effective endearing innocence and we all simply fall in love with her and her simple earnestness. There are other idealist qualities in the other stories, but this is the only one that is sweetly attractive. Meanwhile, the good wishes of the American confound us. He is whip smart, and capable of protecting even this slight girl who fell into his field of vision. But the love affair is unbalanced: he as paternalistic decisionmaker with a broader field of knowledge She as a true human, deliberately content with just that.

Spoilers herein.

I really admire PT. He has a visual imagination. Its rather immature and not integrated into the narrative like Altman can. He has a way of placing and shaping actor's relationship to the viewer. Again, it is rather childish compared to Kurosawa or Welles. But the fact that he knows about this makes him rare and worthy of respect. Because of this, he knows (or intuits) what's in each actor: some play directly, some play themselves playing, some play irony. Those are the ordinary stances. Cruise and most other are limited to that range, but Moore is not. Hoffman is not. These two can create multiple stances that form a baroque richness to the entire project.

I believe that PT started with this notion of filling all the narrative levels of abstraction, something he thinks is in Mann's music. Then he set about constructing a means to create and populate every level that he and partners could find. This is not like Altman who uses the short cuts to play off of and contrast; PT uses something similar to build and is able to achieve effective simultaneous perception of all these levels at once.

The story is not the focus at all, but he has crafted several threads, all based on narrative as discovery. All discoveries in this world produce profound consequences, different punishments for insight. Therefore, all narrative quests in this world have angst. This isn't fun like the Coens give us, this is work.

This man, PT, could turn out to be important. He could create some lifealtering stuff some day. Meanwhile, his notebooks are worth watching.

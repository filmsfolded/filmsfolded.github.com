You really don't want to read this unless you have seen it.

I'm attracted to this specific sort of thing, a deal where what you see is conflated with its own generation, with the writer in the thing.

Its elaborated here by two devices. One is that you don't discover until the very last few minutes that anything like this is up, forcing you to retrospectively go back and reinvent.

Secondly, when you do, you discover a rather complex portrait of a woman. 

That first. What we have is a woman alone. She's had an affair with her publisher, which probably resulted in her success as a mystery writer. At least initially. She's been pregnant by him and had a late abortion. It was a girl. Now she is menopausal, alone and in a terminal rut with her silly detective series. She's lost her faith.

He is already courting new talent and brushes her off, sending her to his house in France, the house she would own as his wife had he stuck with his promise. She feels like a tramp now. So what we see are her lost and losing selves embodied in an extremely promiscuous girl. She's "the daughter," and brings home a different guy each night, all repellent except the one man who is attractive and charming. But he rebuffs her, so she kills him. And to protect THAT has sex with another undesirable. And to protect THAT, writes her book, within which has the recovery of the lost book of "the daughter's" mother.

So far so good. But the execution of this in cinematic terms was a mess. There is a scene where "the daughter" claims the writer as her mother, but its disconnected. There's the scene where the older woman lies nude on the younger's bed and has unwanted sex. These only overlay after the fact when you work it out. The real fulcrum is supposed to be the pool; I suppose the director felt he could command the images better than he has. 

The metaphor I suppose is languid fluid realities, submarine things uncovered. We have identical shots of the two women swimming. We have a signature shot which has the camera moving up the reclining swimsuited young body to the head, lingering over the sensuous zones, and at the head we discover this attractive man standing over. Masturbation ensues.

The same shot is repeated with our older woman who we now discover has her own sensual body. (Until then we've only seen this woman in frumpy clothes.) The shot is identical but this time in the young man's place is the old gardener, obviously the real replacing the fantasy. After the fantasy romance is killed, she does have sex with this gardener.

The shot is replicated again, but with the two women this time. 

You can see this director's visual ambitions, and how they squeak against the boundaries of his capabilities. Oh how Sascha Vierny would have mastered this pool, this water, this skin. Instead we get something intended to be deep, but can only be shallow.

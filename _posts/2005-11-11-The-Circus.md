City Lights is one of the best movies ever made, or so Orson Welles claimed. Most viewers think this is bad Chaplin. I liked it because it didn't have the artificial sweetness of some of his stuff. And because it is self-referential: A movie by a clown trying to make us laugh about a clown trying to make us laugh.

It ends sadly and reflects Chaplin's life, as he broke down during this because of what is depicted here: show business and women problems.

If you like history that reflects itself, you'll like this. It shows that he was aware of Keaton's more explicit self-reference.

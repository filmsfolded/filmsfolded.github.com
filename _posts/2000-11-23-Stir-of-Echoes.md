This is just a rehash, echos, of other minor films. The only interesting thing here is Kevin Bacon. Seems like he's the only extended Brat Packer to survive as an actor.

Filmmakers like him because he shows up and delivers without getting in the way. He is without pretense and understands his role as the instrument of someone else's composition. How refreshing -- especially compared to so many of his peers. The disease of celebrity convinces them that they are somehow at the beginning of the creative food chain instead of at the end. problem is that many of these folks are dumb, dumb, dumb. And they sully everything they work on.

Bacon is not a great actor. But he is a very good one, and that is rare enough. He doesn't quite save this movie, but it is reassuring to watch him work.

This really shouldn't be seen expecting a Wong Kar Wai film. What it is a collage, edited in the ordinary way. He made it as inspiration for his "Mood, Love" project, one of my favorite films. 

The collage is of long gone Chinese actresses: clips of them. I suspect from what he has said, that most are Hong Kong films. A Chinese cineliterate would know all the source films, of course. I did not know any. But its still a great little short. I'm lucky enough to see it more than a year after last seeing "Mood," and I think the distance gives this greater power. You can see his reference. You can see how his urges are shaped. And dressed.

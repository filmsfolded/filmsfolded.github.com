Yes, my friends, I will go to see any Tony Scott film. I know ahead of time that it will not touch me in any way, merely providing me with colorful movement.

I know that the story will be irrelevant, and that the same slots will occur to be filled: the computer squeaks; the overhead map-location situating; the text on screen that tells us where we are; the in-story folks who monitor, usually in a room with display screens.

I know there will be excesses in the acting and chases. I know I will leave wondering how to replace the intellectual gap that has appeared in my life. But by golly, he makes competent films. They are useless, but they work. And I value things that work, if only because it affirms that the world is in good order and that when I make my own internal films, they will work as well.

I watched this and the original. It is amazing how much they differ. The original was built when technology still meant big things like trains. And in those days, one diverting script event was sufficient. You could hold the energy yourself without being told to and given aids. So it was something to see how the thing was reborn. Yes, you still have the runaway train and the connection between hijacker and dispatcher.

But here we have two nice complications. Denzel's character is a crook, and for once he does an understated job. And the diversion of the hijack? Instead of the diversion for the getaway, we have the ransom as irrelevant. Nice touch.

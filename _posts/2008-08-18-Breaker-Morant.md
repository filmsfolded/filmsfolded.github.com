I have several preferences. I'm trying to watch every detective movie from the thirties, for instance. And I am trying to watch every Australian movie. This marginally qualifies. Though its subject is perfidy in the fall of the British Empire and the location is Africa, it is made by an Aussie. Moreover -- and more importantly -- it is a story that in some real sense defined the nation we have today.

The story -- if you don't know -- is about an Australian commando under British command. He is ordered to perform battlefield atrocities, all commands undocumented. When it becomes convenient, the generals deny commanding the atrocities and sacrifice the soldier. Direct political benefit results from the actions against this "colonial."

The episode ran through the Australian people and was a factor in defining themselves away from England. 

The thing is set up as a courtroom drama, with an interesting twist. The purpose of the trial is not to get to the truth so far as the defendants are concerned, but to get to the truth of the accusers. We do find some twists so far as the charges, but the thing is cleverly focused on the inverse of what you expect. Its a very effective narrative reversal. 

It worked for me. I'm not sure that the character of the thing was specifically Australian. But it does work. I think the reason it did for me is because we live in such a time. In the US, we have torturers who, like the men in this film perform their inhuman duty under orders. Like the unsavory proud generals here, our administration is covering their culpability. 

So it resonates.

Spoilers herein.

There aren't many films more enjoyable than those that shoot high and fail spectacularly, and especially those in that category that generate hosannas. 

I don't know the books, but understand the tone is substantially different. The stance of the narrator is on the side of the children readers. The imagination is shared between the writer and the reader. Adult "logic" is broken. It is entirely the opposite in the movie.

For instance, as the children encounter the Count in different disguises, only they could possibly see the truth of the threat. In the movie, everyone would know even before it starts that one actor plays them all, and it is manifestly obvious that he is in disguise. 

What makes a movie a noir movie is that the hero (here our Australian actress) is thrust into a world where fate is actively against you. That fate colors the lens we use in seeing the world so the world will appear strange on the screen. You can do this with angled cameras an oppressive shadows or by fabricating oppressive sets. The latter is emphasized here, and colors are bleak. 

The idea in noir is to strive to "see" above the mechanics of fate. That's why we have: the club of investigators has a telescope as a talisman and the bad guy as an actor with an "eye." The writer is explicitly shown and enmeshed in the film image of fate: an orrery-like clock (here patterned after the one in "Hudsucker.")

But the whole thing is torpedoed by Carrey. Sure he's great, and funny and all. But that's not what this was all about. So you end up with two types of movies warring against each other instead of two realities.

I viewed this in preparation for a comment on the French Amelie.

There is a kind of film that exploits the national character of origin shamelessly. That's because films have a large role in defining culture. All cultures (I presume) have a few stereotypes that they use to reinforce the positive ways they think of themselves. Sometimes, you find a film whose only job is this. Enjoying these films is a disturbing business -- the lowest form of automatic selfmanipulation.

So we have Italians that think of themselves as effusive, continuously demonstrating, heart-driven, passionate livers. And we end up with 'Beautiful Life.' We have many French who consider themselves chic romantics for whom quaint pleasures among pairings are a justification for life. And we are stuck with 'Amelie.'

Here we have a German example: industrious, curious spunk -- quirky directness as inherent charm. Clever mischief. Sexy Katzenjammer.

I hope that in the future, schoolchildren are given some basic skills in perception. While they enjoy something like this little confection, they have some self-awareness about why.

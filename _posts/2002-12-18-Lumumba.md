Spoilers herein.

Approaching any work, the viewer comes with certain presumptions about the compact with the artist. In the case of biographical films, that compact bears special attention.

Why would someone make a film like this? 

Because the person in question is so compelling a being that simple exposure to that life uplifts us? Because there is a political story of injustice we (someone thinks) need to be told? Because the situation supports a drama with universal truths? Because it is a handy framework for a filmmaker to make a film?

If you guess wrong you'll be disappointed, because each of these goals results in a radically different film. I believe Peck's case is a matter of the fourth choice.

It is not an overly romanticized portrait of a noble man like Stone's depiction of Malcolm. It glosses over the complexities of the situation too glibly to remotely inform of the various evils and incompetences visited on that patch.

No, I think it masquerades as a polemic built around a saintly figure, but really is just a handy excuse on which to build a competent film. Peck is a man already known for documentaries friendly to class struggle. But this and the others I know are substantially less articulate than Lumumba himself.

This film is only two years old now, and I got more power out of knowing that as many as a third of the cast in the crowd scenes are dying of AIDS, perhaps already dead.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

In what is by now canonical form for Hispanic filmmakers, this film has nesting, overlaps, each one more fantastic and dreamlike. Calling this sort of thing surreal or magical does not do it justice. It is layered dreamspace, sort of an "Inception" but with different dreamer- narrators.

At the "top," you have a political situation in a country that is so bizarrely extreme I cannot fathom it. The church is encouraging and feeding both sides, and religious iconography of that passive-aggressive Spanish sort is present at each layer.

Within that is a man with a vision of the world, based on bee's nests. He has agency within his world, as he sees the bees as his nested vision with agents. His home is in fact a beehive, with hexagonal windows, the rooms layered like frames in the hive. He dreams on paper, possibly the writer of the film.

Beside the man is his handsome wife who (we surmise) is having an affair that she ends, and re-enters the hive.

But within this family dreamhive are two small girls with another vision, one simpler and more immediate, based on monsters within the simple religious context they see. Most of the film -- which seems highly symbolic but is not I think -- is their dreamspace.

And in a brilliant structural move, at the bottom of this folded system is the same as what we have above the top: a film. The film within is "Frankenstein," the brilliant, magical original by Whale. 

The girls connect to the movie, the father to the girls in the beehive, the nation at war to the father, the nation to the movie we see.

This is thankfully not the dreary exercises in separation from reality that Bunuel is known for. I never relate to his images. This instead starts from the hearts of beings and attracts images. Because it is human, it works. Because it has deliberate layers, we lose our place in the layered system and fall into it. If you are anything like me, you'll cry from halfway until the end.

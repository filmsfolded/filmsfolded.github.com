I saw this on a double bill with the recent Spielberg desecration. Were it not for the juxtaposition, I wouldn't have appreciated this so.

Yes, the effects are clunky by modern standards. On the other hand, in those days effects don't pound the other elements of the film into non-existence.

This version is about sight. If it sees you, it kills you. The primary eye is also a death ray. The ship's sole mission -- those "mechanical swans -- is to support and transport that eye. When the eye becomes personal and enters the house, it takes the form of a tricolor TeeVee dot, the 50's idea of high tech invasive vision.

There's no thumping. There's death but these are angel's death not grinding violence. There's a curiosity in the beings apart from their mission. And believe it or not, this camera seems more intelligent than Spielberg's... more Hitchcockian.

Se "Forbidden Planet" or "Blade Runner" if you are looking for science fiction. See even "Fifth Element." Or see this, even. Stay away from the 2005 version.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 3 -- has some interesting elements.

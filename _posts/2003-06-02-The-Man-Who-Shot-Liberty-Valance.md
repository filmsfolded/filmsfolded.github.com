Spoilers herein.

I admit to being a John Ford detractor. It is not a role I seek willingly; I'd just as soon love his films as I readily embrace many, many others, but I just cannot.

There is a compact between viewer and filmmaker. They set certain rules of the world they create. We enter that world in a relaxed, open manner and what we expect is some reward. If the reward is great, we may relax our expectations on how well prepared the artificial world is.

Now, viewers can differ on what constitutes that reward. For me, it is not enough to simply exercise a few jingoistic platitudes. Not enough to have no dimensionality of characters; one single, simple unelaborated plot line; one simple moral. But you, dear reader may differ, but this is not the matter of my complaint. 

The creation of the world behind that important compact is another thing altogether. A central characteristic of film is the vocabulary that is available to quickly transport you to the world of action, the visual shorthand. And for many years, the Western was a serviceable collection of shorthand cues. We knew we were entering an abstract world, one in which good and evil were crisply defined and in which all intents and actions could be discerned to their deepest depths in an instant. The mythical world of the Westerns were embedded in the popular imagination even before film.

We don't use Westerns this way any more. That's because we have universally rejected the abject laziness of the filmmaker, the profoundly insulting pandering that goes with reliance on this device. 'Fistful of Dollars' of the very next year was made to demolish this ability. No one. No one has attempted this type of western since. This was the last one which took itself seriously and demanded that the audience does so as well.

That's a heavy promise. Not one I am willing to make even for someone who knows his way around. Part of this is my love of film, and the adventure of film, which leads to a sensitivity to cheaters. John Wayne was a cheating actor, one who relied on the purity of the vehicle, on its abstraction, to just as he said 'act natural.' Sure, I'm fond of the persona he exploited, who isn't. But since he isn't committed or skilled enough to go halfway to me in creating a world, I'm not willing to make up the difference. The penalties on my imagination are too great.

Here is an exercise. Except for a very few details (statehood, cattle barons) this story could take place anywhere, anytime. Imagine it outside the western context to see what I mean. Even the admirably busy Jim Stewart can't save it.

Spoilers herein.

What we have here is a talented cartoonist who projects his demons into clever, amusing diversions. He is approached by crass marketeers who would give us nightmarish flatus. So the movie is made, and is as bad as it is supposed to be. What's so wonderful about this movie is that as its disaster unfolds before us, its story explains why it is so bad. Imagination run through the Hollywood machine. Stinks.

We haven't had such a self-referential bomb since 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' where Boris (aptly played by producer deNiro) conspired to make films (TeeVee in the plot) that hynotize. I prepared for this film by reviewing 'Labyrinth,' where a similar store of imagination was squandered. They also relied on fart humor, but nobly skipped the sex jokes.

Spoilers herein.

Here is a film whose DVD Director's Commentary is better than the film.

Oh, the film is good enough so far as all the production values. But afterwards, one wonders why someone thought following these blokes would be rewarding in some way.

The commentary tells us why the director thought so. 

Most films place us in an artificial world, sometimes artificially constructed to seem real. But there is a philosophy that believes that the direct route to reality is most powerful. In this camp, the ordinary -- if properly shaped -- carries great power. The more ordinary in a sense, the more engaging.

For most folks, this isn't true. But it is interesting the tools that this director uses to place our eye in the real. He talks a lot about this in his commentary. Ordinarily, the camera acknowledges the artificiality of the world portrayed by behaving in a way that no ordinary voyeur could. This film is built around two camera perspectives. The first is of four people in a car. As time progresses, the camera inveigles its way into the car as a passenger on the voyage. That's the backbone of the project.

The other eye annotates this. It moves back and forth in time, with deliberate equivalence. It also moves between what he calls subjective and objective -- between being in the mind of a character and then shifting to be an observer of the character. Even in the latter case, the camera is at eye height. The reality in which these considerations take place is far more engaging than the reality depicted.

Helen Mirren is a redhead here, something which really works for her. I compare her performance here with that of a similarly good wife in 'Mosquito Coast.' Better here, in part because of the hair. In a film where performances are supposed to matter, I found the actors playing the young Amy (Mirren) and Jack (Caine) to be the best, most nuanced, most enticing.

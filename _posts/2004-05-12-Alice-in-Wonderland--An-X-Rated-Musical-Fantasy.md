Spoilers herein.

Alice appears in scores of films, and many of the appearances are subliminal. I've made a  hobby of collecting all the references and looking to see how cleverly they exploit the  story. As it happens, there is a natural fit between Alice and sex, and the fantasy that  defines life.

The best example is 'Sex and Lucia,' a deep exploration of sex as illogical story. This is  one of the worst examples. Not as bad as Disney, with better songs and far better cards  (more in keeping with what Carroll had in mind). But except for the effective innocence of  this Alice, the sex scenes are sorta grafted on.

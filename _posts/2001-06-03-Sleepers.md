Spoilers herein.

Levinson's talent is fragile. Actors love him because he works for the scene and he often does produce memorable scenes. Some films can be composed of memorable scenes: 'Rain Man,' 'Tin Men,' even the parts of 'Wag the Dog' that work. One would assume that he knows this, and that is why he is drawn to episodic work.

But this story is different. It requires a vision greater than an actor's. It requires a framing greater than that of a scene. He doesn't have that greater vision and so this very promising material collapses. I'm sure it made matters worse, not better, to have some very talented, serious actors on board. Working with them would have reinforced his tendency to invest in the characters, the role, the dialog, the scene, and ignore the drama; the undercurrent that is carried from one scene to the next; the projection of emotion the audience can carry; the rare but effective moments when the audience becomes co-conspirator; the evocation of memory without showing that memory.

So I consider this to be an interesting, illustrative failure, especially considering what happened next. Levinson, DeNiro and Hoffman seriously believe that the actor is the core of all film effectiveness. (This film proves they are wrong, but set that aside.) They hate it when a writer, 'art' director, even a producer lobbies for a higher vision. They hate it -- here (they believe) they are at the beginning of the food chain in terms of creativity but the bottom in terms of power.

So they collaboratively put together the project 'Wag the Dog,' which revolves around the power of the presenter to create the truth, the real truth. There, they put the artist in charge of the whole country.

Making a film is a balance of power. The director must control that power, sometimes submerging the actors to higher forms of communication and interaction with the audience. Levinson doesn't want that power; the actors should be good enough. Not for this material. No.

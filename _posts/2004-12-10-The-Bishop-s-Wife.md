Spoilers herein.

I make a minor hobby out of movies whose form is similar to their content or some major element of the story.

In this case we have a terrible, incoherent, scattered and just plain mean film that people love. Corbu said of buildings that no building is a good building, that it is impossible to design and build a good building. But some buildings (he presumed only a few) get turned into fine buildings because users embrace them and 'fill them in' perhaps only with their imaginations and engineered blindnesses.

This has many elements of an endearing picture - as many elements as they could cram in: an extremely well tailored angel, a pretty woman (with a cute girl and dog), a perky maid, an old lady who turns over a new leaf, a heavenly boys choir made from street kids. And of course Christmas complete with ice skating. The end has a marriage saved.

But it is all done so clumsily presented it embarrasses. At the time, they knew it was broken. First they switched the roles around, then they junked it and reshot, then went back to the original and rewrote and reshot it. The score is its own story. The result is simply bad architecture in terms of the structure of the thing. It has no form, makes no sense in the large - only in the small, hoping the viewer will "move in" somehow.

The characters (the main ones that is) have no redeeming qualities at all. We are told that the minister was once a good man, but we see no shred of that goodness, even at the end. Our young wife is pretty, but she has no thought at all, even for her child, except for a new hat. But people _see_ them as lovable,

The story features an example of bad architecture within (the cathedral). Pretty interesting fold, that. And it features some of the most garish interiors ever filmed (by the eye of 'Citizen Kane' no less).

This was the era of the influence of the Mankiewicz brothers, so we have another narrative fold as well, one in their tradition. It is a matter of invented or recalled history (we never know which one) presented to the eye of a history perfessor. It involves a coin and is an appropriate play within the play about money and infidelity.

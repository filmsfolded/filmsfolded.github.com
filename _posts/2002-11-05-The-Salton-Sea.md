Spoilers herein.

Movies are like nothing else in life. They have a large hand in creating reality for us, and so we give them personalities just like we do to religious forces.

So we have the comedy and noir and so on which often take on the same sorts of stereotypical characteristics we give to people. At some point, clever filmmakers, writers and actors started playing off the stereotypes of the film genre as they had been for decades with character stereotypes. Then after a long string of films that had films in them in different roles, David Lynch came along and made a film which consists of two film genre stereotypes battling it out: 'Blue Velvet.' The Capra goodness becomes a film Mother nature and an evil noirish thriller type becomes a Satanic deity. They battle for control over what is on the screen, what is in our minds. (The end is a draw.) The actors and characters are mere tokens for the larger battle between two metacharacters.

That reinvented the world of possibilities for clever writers, and every one is now trying some sort of battle between film stereotypes that happens behind the scenes. And in doing so, they often play a common dirty trick on the actors involved. Actors are relatively stupid about the big picture because they have to have extraordinary focus on what they do. Their concerns are just different than the filmmakers. So we have a growing practice of filmmakers taking advantage of the cluelessness of the actor in a particular role.

We have, for instance Harrison Ford in 'Bladerunner.' He's the kind of actor that is genuinely stupid and as a person has no idea of the forces that control his life. Scott puts him in a character where that underpinning, though subtle, helps make the film a masterpiece. The Cohens do this a lot, and the practice is spreading as a major extension of typecasting.

Now we have this clever film, 'Salton Sea,' that goes halfway toward the film type battle by investing the battle in two method actors, Kilmer and D'Onofrio. One lives in a Tarantino (actually Welles) film, the other in an Aronofsky (actually Tarkovsky) film. Kilmer pretends to be in the Pooh Bear film as a personal conspiracy, consistent with Tarantino-like motives. The 'mystery' is in where all the surrounding characters fall, in which film, and ultimately with which film will 'win.'

Following the Lynch formula (Gayton and Caruso are clever but no artists) the end is a merger of the two film types. Chaos meets self-destruction.

I imagine that Caruso worked hard to balance the two film genres, probably talking to each actor separately. Probably keeping a scorecard: one 'thriller' plot twist = one comic drug hallucination.

Along the way, we get a few self-referential devices. These are also requirements of this new form: a reference to Zapruder -- a film that supports two truths and by extension the fabricated documentary of Stone and his plastic realities. A reference to Bob Hope's crap (read: films) and a plot to coopt it. Lot's of references to other films: 'Do you feel lucky?' A 'performance' within: Guzman and Unger work their own little embedded film. Another: Kujo creates his own embedded heist film.

Its all fun if you love movies. A little sad to see Kilmer's commitment taken advantage of so, but that's the tragedy of the thing. These guys are doomed to unhappy lives unless they cease to act, like DeNiro.

It's a fun and clever example of a new type of synthesized, self-referential film, but there's nothing new or particularly lifealtering here.

You know, it is a rather cheap shot to poke fun at old science fiction movies. How they strike us has a whole lot less to do with whether they are good, instead what we allow to pass into the story unquestioned. Most folks laugh at this one: aliens that look like humans, sorta; bulky electronics; pseudoscientific talk about forces (here "nuclear"); a threat of invasion; an intelligent and pretty (by the contemporary standards) girl.

Well, I expect my grandkids to goof on Star Wars and even Bladerunner in a similar way. When I watch these, I watch for how the thing becomes aware of itself.

Note two pieces of apparatus. The first is the device that the scientist builds which allows something like video telephony. This is an amazingly common feature in sci-fi films. Why? I think it has something to do with the fact that it is something like a movie within a movie. We watch. They watch. Add up how much of the story has to do with this device, which has nothing at all to do with the main point of the story. Funny, huh?

The other device is equally interesting and common. It comes I think from a long tradition of physical models in drama. I'm collecting examples for a book under the common theme of orreries, These traditionally are physical models of the solar system, often very large and in the control of some evil magician. By manipulating the model, changes occur in the world. The science fiction version of this is the crude model of atoms which was common in the fifties and many kids erroneously are still taught.

You know the thing: a bunch of balls in the middle and some other balls on a spherical orbit. In this case, its a token with similar magical powers. See how it is set up so that the man in charge is on a raised platform with the model? We do this all the time.

Preston Sturgis made some of the best films in history, perhaps two. 

But he also made some real stinkers and this is one.

His method was to divide the world of the film from reality in fresh ways. His talent was in the dividing, always the same distance. Sometimes the target was fresh, as in "Sullivan's Travels" sometimes not.

The setup here is a story about a woman who tells a story about herself. She gets found out and her target tells his own (false) story. She gets back at him by weaving yet another performance within the performance. After wedding him, she spins yet another false tale on top.

He balks. She regrets and arranges to set him back into the first story-within-the-story which he accepts as reality. And the picture ends happily ever after.

It is a great setup. The problem is that the tone of the thing is all wrong. It breaks Ted's law where these levels need to be discriminated by equal changes in abstraction.

Sturges understood the notion of levels and separation, but not the notion of abstraction which has become the standard for film perception.

Oddly, he got it right the next film, and wrong again in the one that followed that.

Hey, bad movie. Bad, bad.

But wait! It is a train thriller and even a bad train thriller evokes the subgenre. And that collection of feelings is so powerful, all a movie has to do is hint at them to get us to enter a state created by the best part of all runaway train movies.

Trains were the subject of the very first films, the very, very first. There are few things that are as inherently cinematic, on through Buster Keaton and Hitchcock, David Lean and all that. It isn't something that interests me as much as water, architecture, fireworks for example.

But it is an interesting thing that a collection of the hackiest hacks can steal from so many movies literally, paste together a collage of train stuff (helicopter, running on top, hanging underneath, released germs, crash off destroyed bridge, escape from a hanging car), and still have it work, sorta.

Let me recommend a train movie that actually adds something new to the way trains and film interact: "Zhou Yu's Train."

I'll watch any Christie adaptation, hoping for some of the experimental magic of her adventures in narrative form. And I'm usually disgusted at the outcome: movie audiences seem to prefer just being surprised at the end instead of engaging in a tussle with the author for control over the story.

I would have gotten disgusted by this transgression as well. After all, it takes a rather well done game and reduce it to TeeVee level fodder storywise. It doesn't even have the quality of making the characters in the story extreme as is normally the case. By this I mean the suspects, witnesses and victims. The later BBC-influenced versions added interesting locales.

But I found Ms Rutherford and husband too enchanting. Make no mistake, this is not Ms Marple, nor anything close. But it is an very interesting characterization.

Projects like this, indeed including the Christie stories, are a matter of reaching back into the history of archetypal characters, pulling a few out with new faces and knotting their interactions. Christie's talent was in the complexity of the knot, something missing here. 

But it has a great pull on those archetypes. Aged 70 at filming, just the way this woman walks is poetry.

If you divided movies into six major categories, one of them would be the kind that is straight ahead drama, centered on a single character. It would worry about the thing she or he worries about, usually some social injustice. Because these things are scoped so narrowly, they are easy to do well -- it boils down to finding good actors.

And this one is a good one. It has one of our very best actresses. It has a competent director who gives space for actors' intuitions. It has a novel story, which we are told over and over is accurate. This knowledge is supposed to bring the thing closer to us.

This is one of the times when the dynamics of commercial art gets in the way. You need things that motivate artists to do them. They have to be commercial to some extent. That means that they have to draw us in somehow, that we have to willingly engage in the enterprise.

For me, this lacks that draw, even though I am sorta nuts about Cate. She is so naturally deep. But on straightahead work like this she is so wasted I was offended. It is easy to see why this was made: the filmmaker has a personal interest in combating dope. Once rolling, the project attracts good actors. After all, good honest simple characters are hard to find. And the thing does click for what it is.

But I cannot see why we would make the investment in watching it as deeply as serious movies require. (And by that, I mean with a naked heart.))

I cannot see the reason to watch, or the reward for doing so.

So what we have is a waste, I think, and not at all unlike the various wastes we see in the story.

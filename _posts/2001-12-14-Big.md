Spoilers herein.

Tom Hanks is one of a large class of earnest intuitive actors. The problem with this approach to acting is that the talent self-destructs: your intuition needs to be refreshed -- if it is not, you run out of something new to give us. The presentation is found, not constructed so if you only have the same thing to find, you can only deliver that one thing.

On the earnest side, you have to risk everything. Everything. Needless to say, a successful actor who gets $20M per picture no longer has to work in this regard.

This all sums to a career that peaks early. Tom's peak is here.

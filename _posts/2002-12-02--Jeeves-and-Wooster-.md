Spoilers herein.

I'm actually more of a Peter Wimsey fan, because I like stories, tomfoolery in and of the narrative, and character-driven plots. But my wife likes Wooster as well as Wimsey. But Wooster's a whole different beast. Apart from the fact that one is comedy and the other mystery, and one has useless lives and the other rather unselfish -- there are deeper differences.

The Jeeves books are comedies of errors. The characters are driven by the environment and are only there as tokens and to give laughable speeches. The star of the books are the complex, confabulated, skewed situations that these morons thrash themselves into. It takes the full breadth of each book to build layer upon layer upon layer of these situations. Its the denseness of confusion that entertains.

Now along comes a TeeVee executive to mine the books. I am a strong believer that TeeVee is intrinsically stupid: the restrictions of the medium (size of screen, timescale of scene phrasing, the inevitable focus on faces interspersed with travel) are just too strong to allow any of the magic of cinema to shine through. So here we have the wonderful Wodehouse legacy extruded through the constraints of TeeVee.

In the process, we lose the two things that form the foundation of the books. The first is the piling on of comedic situations. Each TeeVee 'episode' takes something less than half of each book, and simplifies it further so that we will not be confused. So the humor at the end which depends on four or more simultaneous errors is distilled down to one Lucy-type situation. Wodehouse enthusiasts are supposed to be smarter than, say your average Austen reader, and why they put up with this is beyond me.

The second element that has been laundered away is the language. Yes, much of the spoken language is preserved intact, but that was never, never the seat of the humor in the language. It was the internal thoughts conveyed to the reader. An example: in the TeeVee show, Bertie says 'Tinkity tonk,' and leaves the room. Its a minor noise. In the book, he says ''Tinkity tonk,' and I meant it to sting!' the last part being part of the continuous internal dialog he has with us. That's the part that's worth keeping. That's the part these TeeVee geniuses threw away.

Most commentors on this marvel at the imagination, the adventuresome cinematography and the mix of black and humor. I found these amusing, but hardly interesting.

What was interesting was how many ways the film explored human connection. Usually you get two: love (or some surrogate) and folded insight, connecting the movie to the viewer.

Here you have:

-- eating one another and with each other -- love of course, love in the romantic sense -- sex (well, this is common too, but not usually divorced from love) -- performing together (two ways) -- conspiring together

You have connections themselves by radio, TeeVee, performing, pipes and chutes in the building (about which much is made), and a repeated set of Rube Goldberg suicide mechanisms. String, yarn, boomerang knife. Postal packages. None of these make sense unless you believe they were put there to make sense.

It is as if they decided first to make a film about connection, and then to place it in a threatening future, allowing filming tricks.

I'm glad this guy went on to make at least one film after this that found coherence. Maybe we have to sit through some number of these sometimes to get a good film. God knows that Terry Gilliam has punished before he rewards.

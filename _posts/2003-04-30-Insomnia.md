Spoilers herein.

Sometimes you stumble upon a mini-film school by accident. The differences among the 'Alien' films for instance is so profound one wonders if it is possible for the same person to actually watch them all. Same here with this and the Nolan/Pacino/Williams restructuring. 

This film is about externalities, about fate, about the oppressive capriciousness of nature. About how we are all alone and always try to outrun that fact. It has a coherent tone. Encounter, even murder, is a mere tick in the cog of the relentless timepiece.

The American remake is about the power of an individual to write reality. This is all about internalities. Encounters are the prime movers in this world. All relationships matter. The Williams character writes himself, about himself, about Pacino's character, about the whole thing we see as incoherence, all of us under his spell. Here, there are decisions and consequences.

It is a difference of day and well, night. Same script more or less, but two films that couldn't be more different. All of us make some sort of important decision along the lines of which of these worlds we inhabit.

I suppose the first step in self-realization is understanding what your personal porn profile is. For me it is spatial, and I am a sucker for just the sort of thing this highlights. It has some dumb character-oriented stuff, and the necessary structure to let us know about the war. But it is packed with air combat scenes. The computer generated character of these scenes was noticeable, I am sure, had I been looking for it, but I wasn't. I was flying.

There are three kinds of shots here. The first are the static shots of the guys in their cockpits, so that we can see that it is not planes at war, but these guys we are supposed to care about. Boring.

But then we have the shots where we see the maneuvers of the planes, spliced in with the POV shots. The composition of these is not particularly inventive. The maneuvers are not historically accurate or aerodynamically possible. But they fit the spatial vocabulary we have built incrementally starting with "Hell's Angels," punctuated by "Star Wars" and elaborated in the last few years by Pixar. The way this crew carries the viewer through these motions is really quite competent and that is saying a lot. It has to do with continuity and rhythm of shifts in space of the planes and the eye.

There is a girl, natch. Pretty. The hero does not get the girl, and the black guy does not get killed. So the story is intelligent from that perspective.

Spoilers herein.

I think this film is miscelebrated. It does not exhibit the chief characteristic that would make Kubrick important. That would only begin with 'Lolita,' beginning an adventure in moving narrative into the space under the image.

Here, what we have is his mastering of conventional narrative. It is a very good film, with the beginning of the fluid camera he would later develop. But it is not the real Kubrick, he who would help begin the revolution of image grammar not yet realized.

Here we have his adventure with studio bosses.

Some movies are good, most not. Of the ones that are not, they still can be fun. This project made money when it was new, but is now not only unengaging but repulsive. Why is actually engaging, because it just cannot be explained by fading fashions.

There is plenty of that: smoking, TWA, pretty airline "stewardesses," gay jokes, the implication that an "airline pilot" is both a status job and that they are tough. A gun joke. Below that is a notion of sexuality, manhood and marriage that is at least unfashionable, and noticeably as bankrupt as the currently marketed ones. 

It had all the attention that a success needs: two then popular movie comics, production values, songs by two of the then biggest pop stars... a script that was already proved as a success in France and (brief) full frontal nudity. So why did this age so poorly? I think it is because it was not good in the first place and viewers did not notice. Contrast this with "The Hangover," which banks on equally inept but currently fashionable notions in those areas. It is, however, completely novel, well constructed and essentially cinematic. This has none of those things to fall back on.

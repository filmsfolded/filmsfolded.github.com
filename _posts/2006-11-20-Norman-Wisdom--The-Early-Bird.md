I've watched one of these now, so I won't have to watch the others, which I understand are much the same.

I suppose there's a charm in these, but not enough for me. If you don't know Norman Wisdom, he's a small guy who plays something in the zone of Laurel Hardy and Charlie Chaplin with a hint of Jerry Lewis. The plot here is a small guy working for a small business who bests a big business (and its bosses). Some mild physical humor weighted toward falling down stairs.

There is something interesting here though. The story takes us past quite a few men. Every one of them has a woman who gives little kisses and coos. All the bosses of course have cuties who act coy and chirp on cue. A working man has a more relaxed bird. All are pretty (after the fashion of the time). All have their breasts punched up and displayed as fully as possible.

Except for one. The famous Mr Grimsdale, who is our comic hero's boss. At each crisis, Norman runs back to Mr. Grimsdale to repeatedly interrupt him in the embrace of his woman. The comic situation starts with her not being his wife -- but none of these women are wives. What's comic here is her size. She must be 6 foot four. For many shots, she must be standing on a platform so that Norman's head is level with her breasts.

I wonder why this is considered funny? Its clearly engineered. She's large but not bossy. She has no physical advantage. She's goods to be cuddled just like the other girlies we see. And its not a Margater Dumont deal. Her size alone is meant to be amusing.

A visit to another world. I suppose it is no more puzzling than asking why we laugh when someone falls down stairs.

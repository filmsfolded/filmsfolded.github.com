I saw this together with "Deep Red," a later and more lurid project, but much in the same tradition.

My opinion is that what matters in films is less what is said in terms of events, but how it is said. Its a collaboration between viewer and filmmaker about sustaining a delivery channel. Its an intimate dialog, involving secrets, internal softnesses, selves, that you would rarely (usually never) expose to an actual human.

The approach here and with Argento is that the nature of the camera carries weight. It isn't enough, say, that you are told that the particularly abstract fascism of Italy was aggressively designed out of attractive contrasts; you have to see it. You have to have that notion permeate the whole world you see. You have to collaborate, because the camera wouldn't be where it is unless you were watching, metafascistwise. The lights, the sun, the moon only take their places such because you have bent the world to conform. You, if you dare to watch this, are the conformist.

Its a film about two women, one of only two and a half films of Bertaloucci that work for me. They sit in the film uneasily. Usually, we are given a real world and an idealistic, refined, theatrical and therefore unrealistic character. Think Holly Golightly. Here, its reversed. The world itself is what's bent. The two women are real, humans with desires and lives that color outside the lines and bleed untidily.

One is more real, unsafe. Its remarkable that Bertolucci has avoided the trap of making her sexy along with being unsafe, real. There's sex, but its part of her, not the external stuff that makes the attraction. These were good days for this filmmaker and his cinematographer friend. You can clearly see the very collaboration between the two (the photographer in this case your avatar, the collaborator) reflected in the more grand films of Coppolla. It works there but is hidden by the noise of the stories. Here, it is more pure.

We all die when the climactic event occurs. We've been rooting for this woman to prevail, perhaps in a sort of "Casablanca" ending, and our hero (and therefore ourselves) to be redeemed. Watch it and discover that we are not. Even today we conform, we choose the contrast, we die.

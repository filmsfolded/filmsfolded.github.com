Spoilers herein.

I really appreciate artists willing to push the envelope. They're not pushing if they don't  fail at least a third of the time. This is a failure, but an interesting, glorious one and in its  way is more interesting to watch than, say, 'O Brother.' You know something worth  knowing is up when the most nuanced actor in a high level project like this is a painting.

These guys are cinefiles, enthusiasts who examine what they and others do with  meticulous detail and grand vision. They reach for a specific tone, different for each  project, and then engineer the pieces to support. 

What do you think? Was the original vision too ambitious: a takeoff from the

Shakespearean actor from Huck Finn? In this case, it is a Coen-like folding: an actor  playing an actor playing Twain who writes the riverboat plot using a previously written  skeleton (something recently done by PS Hoffman in 'Cold Mountain').

Or is it that the vision was as apt an reachable as any they have had, but they erred in the  engineering? I think it is this latter. Some of the blame is theirs: they have come to be  hypnotized by the power of themed music in their films. Here it is a distraction, saps  resources and fails to support the quirky vision. Tbone failed them.

But they were stuck with some bad casting. Once that happens, you're lost. Hanks is such  a heaviweight that he forces the vision to bend to what he wants to do as an actor. Big  mistake.

The old lady Marva Munson is capable of playing only one sort of character. We've seen  her do it in several dreary projects. She just couldn't ever get the joke and really believes  she is in an Eddie Murphy movie.

And third, and almost incidentally, we have Wayans. He also knows only one way of  swinging. 

None of these three was capable of getting on board the twisted vision the brothers had.  Dozens of real actors have. But these three are, alas, characters now, not actors.

Still, you can see what they had in mind, and still be amused by it even though it never  appears on the screen

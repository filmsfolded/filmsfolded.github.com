I haven't studied Scorsese well, but know and admire his two best: "Temptation" and "Color." In this early film, one can see his energetic camera. Probing, experimenting, finding limits.

What we have here is a completely ordinary, actually vacuous story. Some acting is good in a showy way, some horrible (I guess Kristofferson was still under Babs' blessing). Scorsese gets an okay performance from the kid only by having him mug to his "mom." Keitel and Foster were already working up to "Taxi Driver," and seem unprepared here.

Never mind. Scorsese's camera is the star. It is always in motion, sometimes circling, sometimes looking into the light, occasionally working with color. Strangely, this director seems afraid of darkness, but many other experiments are here. You can already see here his belief that the camera is NOT the audience, but some disembodied, dancing god-narrator. There's no arty self-reflection here, no direct engagement, no mysterious non-narrative sideshots. I don't know all his films, but this seems a constant.

Unfortunately, this stance is essentially a commitment to telling a story. So for Scorsese to work, you need a very, very good story. "Temptation" and "Color" provide that. Alice does not.

I recommend this film not for any of the ordinary reasons, but because of the youthful, unstudied exuberance of the camera, radical in its time for Hollywood.

I haven't seen the Brando version yet, but this version is quite different than the Gable-Laughton one. The cinematic requirements are different. In the early version the motivator was an inherently cruel man. So we had to focus on the voyage out and what tensions were created by that cruelty.

The shooting of the 1936 ship (copied later in extreme emulation in Pirates of the Caribbean) is architecturally aware and the editing is adept, increasing the tension. Everything that follows merely recalls that cinematic power, burning it in.

This version is radically different. The captain in this case is a good man, with great kids (giggling little girls). Good friend of the mutineer. What causes the mutiny in this case was the allure of Tahiti, specifically the ready, open sex.

If there was ever an opportunity for something cinematically effective it is the erotic allure of a an exotic array of women and an easy place. All our cinematic drivers were explored by artists earlier and the echo of Gauguin's vaginal meditations in color and anticipated desire are what roots this.

It does as far as it goes anyway. The women are barebreasted. They always appear in a wall of smiling, demonstrably simple pulchritude. It tantalizes with knowing what would work here.

And then it blows it, so radically it almost seems that some daft crew of kids stole the beginnings of the production and blindly sailed forward.

Gibson is a lout. He knows how to shout, but he knows nothing about adoration, the soft surrender leading to hardened resolve that this version of the story demands. Hopkins differs in being a real actor and during this period he really was effective when he had a soul to work with. But the director has thuggish sensibilities, and Hopkins complies.

Tahiti and surrounds have a place in the history of the cinematic imagination, probably beginning with "Legong" and that 36 "Bounty," and then transmuting with US Navy war experiences ("South Pacific" and its strange, distorting filters), and the redefinition of exotic sex.

This is a major disaster in most ways. But it is fascinating in how it approaches acquired copulation as a possible center of life -- and then runs away. The impulse of repression mutinies against the comparatively weaker ones of pleasure.

Two comments on the narrative. The story is presented as recounted to us by Bligh in court, recalling from memory and reading from what seems to be a detailed log, written even when being beaten by cannibals. It doesn't work at all. Not in any respect. Puzzling.

The other is the presentation of the ship. We know from the beginning that the sensibilities of place will be centered on "horizon shots," and the cinema of silhouettes (which are reversed with the burning ship at the end). Compare this to how the ship is handled in the 36 version and the modern Depp pirate movies (only two of which have appeared as this is written). They are profoundly architectural and presented as the container of what we see.

Not here. The ship we see is undeniably real, but you can see that it is a modern ship dressed out to look as it were built of wood. The cinematographer has to avoid any detail of the ship. That's even when the ship itself is important, as when Bligh insists that the deck is filthy and has Fletcher's watch repeatedly work to clean what we understand as imaginary contamination.

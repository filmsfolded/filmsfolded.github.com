The story IN this movie is of a man, a bank teller who is laid off. He has a crippled wife (okay to say "crippled" in those days) and a sweet kid, both of which he loves dearly. So he embarks on a second career of murdering women. He gets caught and gives a speech about the inhuman forces of society that drove him to that state because it didn't appreciate his talent. The story OF this movie is amazingly similar as Chaplin tries to reinvent himself as all his worlds have collapsed.

Most of the movie is of his escapades. We are supposed to be charmed by his methodical approach contrasted with his ruthless morality. At the same time, there is his almost trademarked folding: Chaplin playing a character who himself is acting, and within those folds are all sorts of ambiguities about whether he enjoys it. He may be enjoying the seductions and possibly the accompanying ravishment -- this notion is introduced early on in the first seduction we see, one that goes on for much of the screen time.

The interesting thing about this is how it began: a real life villain, an idea of Orson Welles' to bring Chaplin back in triumph. One wonders whether Welles could have pulled it off with all the combined foibles both men would have brought to the project, both famous as poor collaborators.

Well, we know that Chaplin alone couldn't handle his own story; we know that the folds enveloped and smothered him. His was able to master them in his next venture by quite literally taking the persona of a washed up clown.

Both that and this feature a young woman at risk who he helps and in his moment of greatest need is repaid.

Polanski is a dear friend, and relationships like this weave in and out of the most internal paths of life as it flows.

He's polish, through and through, the sort of Pole who knows that life is music, music is composition not discovery, and composition is all about what you leave out. Its selection by purification, love by a sort of shared seclusion. Its a basic enough way of living that when applied to art, it can seem that the artist is drifting, moving from self to self.

Not so. Polanski's expression comes from the same place, whether producing "Vampire Killers," "Repulsion," "Ninth Gate," even BAD movies like "the Pianist," or whatever that seem all over the map. They each have this core generative notion of assembling pure nodes around which story elements selfconsciously assemble.

Here the idea is to leverage hardy's peculiar way of telling a story. Hardy is all about external needles stitching together an individual's fate as she stumbles forward. It was a deliberate, radical reaction to the Germa and French ideas about different forms of pre-existing global fate that humans SHARE and discover. He was the first to experiment with characters that are lucidly writing the environment that write them.

Its a great notion for someone like Polanski. His approach was to engage his creative soultools with sex, particularly sex with an innocent -- someone whose stirrings in the context of worldly intrusion remind him of what he knows. He chose Nastassja knowing that her father was much the template for this notion in film. He fell in love with her. Its a sad sort of symmetry that she later reported that he was an incompetent lover, but of course that's the point.

Anyway, what he chose to do is frame this entire story in terms of encounters on roads. Its all about roads, coming and going, interrupted voyages, and intangible obstacles. Unfortunately, the cinematography that was planned, with creeping intangibles of fog and creeping stones, machines and interruptive sounds, glances that are avoided -- all this was terminated with the death of the cinematographer right after the project began. That, inexplicably, adds to the charm of this: intense, discovered as it happens, and doomed.

I cried for my friend.

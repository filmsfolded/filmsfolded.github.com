Sometimes genius settles into that space between a soul and the world, and keeps spinning things or value. Sometimes an artist can mature into it and reshape the gift into something of his own. But sometimes it just escapes, a matter of inattention or poor nourishment. Only the second reliably produces art that can be rebent to fit, and that is the whole exercise, right?

But the third of these is engaging, even though the films are bad, because you are watching a real tragedy unfold, one that is deep and full of loss.

Argento really mattered several decades ago. His intuitions were brilliant. He changed film, and thereby changed me. The ecosphere of dreams shifted with his colored tone poems. He both invented and mastered the notion of filmmaking based on structured color. In doing so, he reduced the narratives to what he thought of as the basics of life: violence situated in sex, sex situated in breasts and forced penetration, extreme penetration situated in evil. His extremes -- and they have been extreme -- forced the viewer to find their own constraints and limits. 

I believe this all to have been intuitive, but it worked because the actual cinematic vocabulary was so rich and the colors had edges so sharp we allowed ourselves to believe that the world of the camera was magical, full of sex and penetration. That was then. Now we have this, which is more violent and fantastically less cinematic, but for the surprisingly arresting first 20 minutes. It matters that this sequence was filmed first, even before funding for the remainder was secure.

But it is interesting for a couple of reasons. One is the mere fact that this man mattered at one time. He and DePalma changed the camera, feeding off one another like John Lennon and Bob Dylan. Now he is merely a memory as we have internalized his innovations. We think the camera always was thus.

We know that the mix of forces he was playing with early in life was unstable and that he would have to continually fight with internal chaos each film. And that the value of those films resulted from he himself battling his notion of evil and (barely) winning. Because he kept pushing the boundaries, and because his sexual vitality (his prime weapon) would fade, we knew that "evil" would overwhelm him at some point.

What we have here is a visual record of the man in his battle against the evil of an internal chaos that eats his cinematic genius. And we see him lose. It is a sad thing to know, but such a noble try. He knew when he embarked on this that he would win or lose, but it would in the cinematic form. If he should die, he should die within a vessel he made. 

This is something we need to honor. 

The second interesting thing is that he cast his wife and daughter in the key roles.

His wife is the now faded white witch who weakened the previous evil mother so that she could be defeated by a "dancer." (Argento has called his moving colors dances.) Now she is a ghost. The daughter is a restorer in a museum, who finds herself the only one now that can help the men (police, always right behind the daughter) defeat the evil witch descending on Rome. This is all so overtly autobiographical it need not be explained.

Asia Argento is the daughter playing the daughter. She spends almost all of the movie witnessing tokens of a creative self being violently destroyed: church, museum, infant, mistress, wife, friends. All are killed in a way indicative of his inner turmoil. I like watching Asia, because I think she as well is a natural, with gifts to give. Near the end, she is defeated in front of the evil, sexy witch, with the only choice left being which of the coven will eat her. (The policeman who has stuck with her is also captured.)

So far, we have simply a record of how Dario has been defeated by himself, the only choice he has is how to show each "death." (The death of the "mistress" is probably too horrible to be seen and I warn off most women, and anyone who registers these things well.) At the last moment, Asia is able to snatch the colored "dress" from the witch and burn it. This red garment has everything. It is profoundly sexy. It is Dario's signature red. It has the secret symbols that animate the forces of the world. It burns, the earth shakes and the building crumbles. An erect tower of the building turns in on itself and impales the evil witch, but forever destroys the building.

We've been carefully told by a scene that does nothing else, that the building is thousands of years old and has everything: sex, magic, church and even, yes, Nazis!

Asia and the cop who tags along, are forced to wade through the sewers below, turds dropping on her as she wades through millions of maggots. This scene last three times longer than his usual. They come to the surface laughing at having survived. 

The story of a genius aging and using self to build self.

Spoilers herein.

Here we have a film for kids that may have resonated in its day. But now it is only of historical interest. But what interest! So many actors got a start here.

Cage and Whittaker are hardly there so not much interesting to see. The two really interesting ones are Penn and Leigh. I've seen this film, 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'The Pledge' in quick succession. Of male actors working today, Penn and Downey are in a class by themselves. Downey being more internally focused. Penn likes to let us watch, weaving his own watching, his display of himself and his display of his character into a single performance.

You can see him doing that here. I recommend you get the DVD and listen to the comments of writer and director. After nearly twenty years, these guys still apparently don't know what Penn is doing. He's graduated and they are still in high school.

Jennifer Jason Leigh fascinates. I think she is every bit as serious an actress as Penn. But she has an instrument that holds her back -- being a woman actor carries a curse because there are fewer risks you can take in how you move your body. Think why we don't have a female Jim Carrey.

Lesser actors like, say, Jeanne Tripplehorn have a more appealing instrument, so we the audience accepts more effect with less talent. The contrast is so much greater here with Leigh working next to Cates. Just as all Americans are inescapably racist in some way, we all have this high-school level barrier of archetypes of woman that limits our skills as dramatic viewers. (Sissy Spacek, another effective actress, suffered from this same problem I think.)

I'm sure the dynamic about how actors find intelligent roles has much to do with small town politics, but Leigh has given us a 'Mrs Parker,' and a reporter in 'Hudsucker' that is every bit as self-referential as Penn's Surfer Bud. The problem is us I'm afraid. We need to graduate.

Also. A lesson for P T Anderson. Crowe here writes the characters first (they are based on real people) then creates a series of small episodes. This works when the point is to evoke a general feel as in the porn industry 'Boogie Nights,' here, the rock industry in 'Almost Famous.' But usually that environmental impression has much less impact than other narrative approaches can accomplish in drama. Watch this film and you are reminded that its only charm is the evocation of an environment, which has since been mined numb. 

Better to develop into real drama. Crowe hasn't since this. Let's hope PT does.

Sometimes a movie isn't a movie at all; sometimes it is just a play. And sometimes when it is just a play, it is a just a forum for the playwright's reaching. Fair enough I suppose.

You'll find a lot of those in the 30's, where America was trying to find itself and was toying with socialist ideas that today seem radical. At the same time, movies were trying on several ideas in a quest to discover what they were.

Both of these exploratory periods are largely forgotten today and the options they offered aren't grieved as they should have been.

This play was a sentimental screed on the terrors of capitalism, and how it necessarily destroys the soul of everyone who participates. The bad guy drives competitors to death, aspires to be the world's largest arms provider, a monopoly in fact. Bankers = bad. Dropouts - good.

There's an inserted bit where our hero (Barrymore) refuses to pay taxes on the grounds that they do nothing useful. And another (from the play) where inept cops arrest the crowd as suspected Soviet revolutionaries. They are tossed in a cell with folks obviously there because of financial injustices.

Its entertaining enough, and if you thought "Wonderful Life" was a great film, you'll like this too. You'll probably like "V for Vendetta" also, as it is a similar simpleminded polemic wrapped in a minimum of cinematic sugar. Same core, different sugar.

And it is the sugar, after all that makes this work.

In the similar, later one for Stewart, "Pot O Gold," the characters weren't comical. They did comical things, but none of them were ridiculous, even the greedy capitalist who, like in this, needs to buy a house and is thwarted by happy campers.

This script is different (Pulitzer-winning, incidentally). Silly characters populate the thing: A girl who imagines herself a ballerina and can't stop dancing; her dope husband who still thinks he is on the College football team; a man obsessed with fireworks; another with mechanical toys and so on. A large Russian visitor who comes for the free meals and whose opinion of everything is: "It stinks." Black jitterbugging servants.

Beware, you'll like this little confection, and even buy the message within as a result. Or you'll wish you lived in a so-called "simpler time" during which this simple wrapper and message worked.

If you come to these old things because you like one of the actors, let me point out Ann Miller as the dance-obsessed wife. She was 14 at the time, having lied about her age to get the job. What an amazing presence she was, even then.

Wow.

To understand my reaction, you have to know that there is a huge shift underway at present in the US military. The promise of artificial intelligence has repeatedly disappointed, so it will be some time before we have autonomous robots with weapons. But there's this move to remotely controlled weapons, starting with planes. Its happening now. And not everything is working out as intended.

So seventy years ago we see this cartoon. Its one of Tex Avery's first, and of interest just on that score. Its also interesting because its in the first wave of movies that assume the inevitability of Americans entering the war. 

The joke is that Porky is in a remotely controlled plane. The control is by voice, and that controller accidentally overhears kids telling a puppy to perform tricks. The plane complies and we laugh. One clever joke has the plane fly through a wagon of hay and end up with a wagonload of straw hats.

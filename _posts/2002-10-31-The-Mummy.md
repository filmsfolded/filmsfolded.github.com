One forgets with the many subsequent versions and remakes how good a film this original is.

The acting is goofy of course, but that it a matter of the period rather than the caliber of the project. The camera-work and editing is perfect within the scope of the craft at that point. The lighting and composition in particular.

What I like about this is the very clever writing. It is in the tradition of 'The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari' where some element of the narrative is not to be trusted. There it was the ravings of a madman. Here it is the scroll which creates one of the characters and drives the action through a 'curse,' actually a spell.

I am a student of stories-within-the-story. Here is one of the earlier ones, already mature. The reanimated mummy 'shows' in a film the history behind the story. This film follows what I consider a important rule in screen writing: the 'distance' of the film from reality (the abstract dialog and posturing for instance) must match the distance from the film to the film within. So it is here. This same film-within footage was reused in several successive Mummy films if I recall.

Amazing how many early Hollywood personalities were Hungarian.

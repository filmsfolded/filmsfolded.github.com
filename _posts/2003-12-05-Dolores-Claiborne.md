Spoilers herein.

Stephen King is cursed: most of the tricks he pulls in writing seem like they can be  translated cinematically. But when the time comes they fall down a well.

The trick this time is simple: Two realities. The one we think we see and understand,  running concurrent with a past that annotates and changes the future so that at the end  we see a changed reality.

The agent and as it turns out fulcrum of the past story is a reporter, whose eyes we use.  The clever fold is the reversal of the detective form. There is a detective, and he is  persistently working on a hunch as the form requires.

Detective stories are a game between reader and writer for who successfully invents  reality. Usually, the reader is given the detective's eyes. Here, the reader is given the  writer's eyes: JJ Leigh does her fast talking writer from 'Hudsucker' and 'Dorothy Parker.'

The cinematic translation is Dolores' visions. But it just doesn't work on screen as it does  on the page. In the written version, WE see the past and can map it onto Selena's  discovery. Here, Dolores sees and we do too. It confuses us about who we are.

There's something about melodrama that we cannot avoid. We seek it out. We impose it on politics, sexual relationships, even traffic accidents as we drive by. We seem to need it.

Nowhere is this more constant than in animal stories, stories about the struggles of creatures that we equate to that of humans. In this case, they seem more human than, say, lions. They walk like people more or less. They caress and swoon. They are loyal and experience despair. 

The "children" play like ours do. All this is shown to us in a way made to emphasize the "human" drama of the thing. Why do we find it appealing? Because it abstracts what we know about ourselves, or so we think when we want to see the world melodramatically.

About 30 years ago, this unseemly tendency was satirized by an Australian radio program called "Death of a Wombat" where a narrator took us through the most horrid of dramatic excess. In its day, that excess was so extreme, it was comic.

Well, over the decades we have experienced melodramatic inflation so the even more ridiculous tone and script of Morgan Freeman is considered as an honest rather than a comic account.

I suggest you watch this it you can with your ears closed and an eye towards the brilliance of the thing cinematically. The melodrama is bit repulsive.

Spoilers herein.

Pretty thin stuff, this. The entire structure is based on some supposedly snappy sex-tinged dialog and the reverse of the scam-the-scammers. Because of the first part of the latter, it is often compared to 'Company of Men' but that completely misses the point of the reversal. No matter, if this could have had value, it would have been in the diner, in what happened there among these four guys and the movies they weave with their stories. Some of this DOES have edge: the pair that screws and steals, the fabrications of the masturbator. 

But it doesn't have nearly enough to justify spending time with. 'Red Meat' is vastly superior in this regard.

I watched this because Amanda Peet was very effective in the one 'fulcrum' scene in 'Igby' where she meets her lover and is rejected, all soundlessly. Effective film drama that she inhabits. No skill or charm here however.

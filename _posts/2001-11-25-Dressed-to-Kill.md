Spoilers herein.

Empty stylization. The Hitchcock references are beside the point in my mind. But that stylization is terrific and original! A much more intelligent eye than Hitchcock ever had.

Which raises the point: can a film be worth watching if its only plus is in the novel stylization? Here's my problem: 'Snake Eyes' blows me away with such a radical vision, and it has less in terms of acting and story than even this.

I say yes, but you have to take this appraisal as from someone who sees a lot of films, and who appreciates genius and risk even in an incomplete result. Part of the distraction here is the poor acting all around, the screwy makeup, the derivative plot, and the mishandling of how sex as a driving force behind the story. 

This last is the only real problem. That's because sex is salted here and there, but doesn't connect as neither a real driver of the story nor an inspiration for the art in which it is wrapped. An example of sex as an effective driver is the inaptly named 'Frenzy.' That story moves as a result of our connecting with -- even collaborating with -- the murderer. The actors in Dressed just don't have the juice; though Nancy is cute, she hardly seems really really bad. Another example of a director blinded to the limits of the woman he loves. 

As an example of how sex can be infused in the environment, I'll cite 'Mulholland Drive' as a recent example. Doesn't happen here. Even the shower scenes seem sterile.

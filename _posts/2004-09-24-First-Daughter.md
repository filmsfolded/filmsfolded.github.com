Spoilers herein.

I'll let others comment on the general vapidity and unoriginality of the thing.

What interests me is how Whitaker works. I've long maintained that actors and filmmakers have differing agendas, and it is a rare actor who can make a passable film. Whitaker is at least a good actor. But look what he does with this.

He shapes every speech, indeed every scene as a closed phrase - something that has a small opening and a neat close. The story itself is a set of vignettes loosely tied together (with the thinnest of borrowed excuses), so the style is an apt reflection but on a smaller scale.

Even Holmes' acting is based on setting up a pose, striking the pose, then resolving it. Interestingly, this style of acting is the sculpted 'sound bite,' something directly criticized in the dialog. 

A real filmmaker will have some notion of tone and shape to the project as a whole. Whitaker's solution, like John Carpenter, is to write much of the music and to tie things together with a certain musical feel. But that's not cinema.

But you can see how Forest writes himself into the thing: he is the roommate, the silent (until the end) guard, and the steward on the plane (played by his brother!) all of whom are designated observers. This is an intelligent idea. I didn't say he was stupid, only that he lacks cinematic vision.

The only mildly interesting moment was Andrea Avery as the roommate from Hell, though the script bungles whose roommate she was to be.

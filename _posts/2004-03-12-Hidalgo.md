Spoilers herein.

I've spent time in a large script engineering lab. That's where they confabulate something  like this.

Start with a timely notion: a noble American in Iraq, employing honest grit and will in the  face of Islamic fate and goofy beliefs. But this must be a true American, so make him half  Indian. That way he can also be of a 'people of the hoof.'

Then triangulate among three formulas: 'Lawrence of Arabia' so you can be cinematic  with sand (and even reanimate Sharif); 'Seabiscuit' which takes the theme of the little  mongrel horse up against 'purebloods' (here transformed from the 'liberal' politic of the  original to 'conservative'); and 'Last Samurai' so we can borrow the drunk who carries  the guilt of an Indian massacre to a dead life in a wild west show.

Triangulation is unfortunately a standard in these recipes. Then season with a couple  women, a couple villains (better if they overlap), some parental conflict, some effects and  a few other standard mechanisms. Then cook and promote.

I do willingly enter the theater expecting to be manipulated, and yes for profit. But  there's something intolerably crass about this sort of mechanical button-pressing.

There was some extra story about the hawk saving the day at the end: more not quite  subliminal reference to Bush. But test audiences took it out. Good for them.

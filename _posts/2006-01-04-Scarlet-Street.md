I suppose there are things worth mentioning: the relationship between a whore and her pimp/lover and the skill of Lang. Perhaps you see some extraordinary acting.

As for myself, Lang upsets me because he seems merely a highly skilled filmmaker with good intuitions and few signature tricks. But he seems to have no soul in his projects. They seem mechanically conceived, German, if you will. Sure, the sets of "Metropolis" were extraordinary, and the staging of "M." 

But I think Godard had him right in "Contempt," a knowledgeable old guy with no blood in his projects.

This one is often cited as among the best of noir, but I don't agree. Noir for me has lots of bizarre coincidences that could only happen because our poor victim is in a film. We conspire with the goddess of fate of that world to jerk the players around. Plus, our hapless target has to be innocent, so far as the territory it drifts into.

This guy causes his own problems. The story moves along because of the conspiracy of the two lowlifes, not by some capricious force. And the end is strictly Poe. Its no "Detour."

But it does have some interesting folds. It is, of course a project made by an artist and it is about an artist. It features an actress whose character pretends to be an actress, and then a painter. While the original movie is related to painting (and is a great movie, by the way), it doesn't feature painting. That was added into this version and is the one element that truly works.

Lang uses a different camera mode whenever a painting is in the frame (except for the last), as if he were stepping back and letting us know that we are in the painting.

This is not noir by my definition, and Lang isn't the master that many suppose. But this definitely is worth watching.

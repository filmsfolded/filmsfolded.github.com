Spoilers herein.

I suppose this film is a failure if seen out of its context as one of only three films by Malick. But if you have seen his 'Red Line,' then you can discern what was in his mind in this first outing: 'Tracing entire sentences on the roof of my mouth that no one can read.'

At this time, some, led by the French were creating a non-realistic parallel narrative but in the direction of romantic idealism; the Swedes' parallel narrative tended toward archetypical symbolism; Kurosawa, Kubric and others were weaving parallel alternatives, but always targeted. For instance Welles had targeted architectural space in his manifolds.

Malick had a notion of internal parallel narratives that instead just float -- a thread that hovers over the visible action but does not annotate it. That makes it the center of the film instead of just a stylistic addition. Everything is reversed: the players and story aren't the focus, they just provide some liquid for the chunkier matter of the visual soup. The real features here are disembodied words, ethereal music, unrelated lovely images. The story needs to diminish to the point of a mere shadow of a real movie, the performances to copies of real actors. We are in fact told just who these actors are.

An example of the anti-idealism is the handling of sex. In an ordinary film, sex would be ridiculously miraculous -- fireworks! Here, the only appearance it makes is a comment on how unremarkable it is.

This is the earliest instance I know where an auteur deliberately casts an actor that he knows cannot do the job. He doesn't want dimensionally acute verity, so Sheen's dimness is a plus. Spacek is intelligent, here as a 24 year old actress playing a 15 year old by sloughing off any effort at the same self-awareness that Sheen struts. She has problems at the end, because at root her method relies on the investment in character, in this case the very character who throws away all the elements of character.

Malick is a semiotician finding lucidity in the mechanics of dream incoherence: a philosopher first, filmmaker second. Kubrick was later to adapt Malick's notion by going much beyond: his 'Eyes.' has an apparently zen parallel, but falsely so -- it appears to not make sense, but in fact does.

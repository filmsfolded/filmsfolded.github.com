There's a deal you make with an artist: they get to satisfy themselves but they also have to satisfy us.

What's interesting is the balance Figgis has struck. There's a whole lot more emphasis on the film-specific elements: blocking, transitions, particularly apt sound and soundtrack, in out in in out cadences.

The ordinary theatrical elements are slighted: dialog, character development, old fashioned story values. This balance works for me in 'Time Code,' because the filmic experiment is so intriguing. And a similar balance works with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' a film congruent in respects other than the city. 

But the balance completely fails here. I don't care about Cage, or his character. No greater focus is raised. There is a successful evocation of style, but it is wasted. As contrast, 'Fight Club,' raised a much more intriguing and troubling world. The acting doesn't impress me so much. Playing a drunk or a mental incompetent is a lesser art, and it is a rare film where illustrious acting can alone make the trip worthwhile.

Figgis is interesting, and I'll go out of my way to watch his fuses, but he hasn't connected them to anything explosive yet.

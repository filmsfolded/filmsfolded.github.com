Spoilers herein.

Something weird is happening. We are in a state of accelerating change in American society, at least as rapid and perhaps as radical as the sixties. Just think about this film.

The revenge story is old old old, but nearly always the issue is revenge for an evil or unjust act. Think about the hundreds of revenge films, like perhaps the Bronson flicks. The revenge setup is always that something incredibly horrible happens to set the stage. Then, we allow ourselves to feel no shame when incredible violence and usually supernatural luck or prowess is brought to bear.

Then we had the pretty radical 'Unforgiven,' where the revenge is purchased, and as things progress the original offense keeps getting amplified. Pretty strong, powerful and intelligent stuff.

Now with this film, things are turned around. The revenge story is from the other side. As viewers, we never question that there really is a truck driver out there who fully justifies his actions the same way Bronson did. Millions, even whole nations, to whom an apparently trivial sleight actually carries great weight. Watch as we understand completely how any amount of force can be brought to bear.

Watch how the surprise ending is a surprise only because it completes the cycle: the debt is paid, everything is washed clean, newly corrected and balanced life goes on.

LeeLee was effective in 'Eyes Wide Shut,' where she played a rather simple role. Here, little is demanded, but she delivers less. She's off my list.

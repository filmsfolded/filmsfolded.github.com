Another film with an actor acting about acting. This is a common and appealing device, one which I especially appreciate. But those traits make it hard to say something new or even modestly interesting. Neither can be found here.

The excuse for making this was to update Hitchcock, using some young hot actors. Also to take advantage of a stylish director, recently lauded for his English Patient. Well, this doesn't work for me. Am I the only one who thinks that Matt Damon has a hard time? Oh he tries hard enough, but he wants us to know it. There are lots of acting styles out there. But this 'watch me work' style is distracting.

This director and I do not connect. He's fundamentally a storyteller via narratives from novels. This is pretty risky business, partially because of the fundamental differences in narrative requirements --  between seeing in your mind and on screen. Also, he picks books with some adventure in narrative structure. His approach is to distract by focusing on intense acting to fill multidimensional characters. A second tactic is to distract with some lush texture or another.

The first trick fails because he has thin actors this time around, as opposed to the strong ones in 'English Patient.' Jude Law has some potential it seems, but the others aren't very intelligent. Don't they know not to put actor interviews on DVDs if all they can say is vapid?

The second trick fails because the director just doesn't have the skills to sustain a strong, unfamiliar thematic vision outside of the desert. So we get mostly more or less the mundane, punctuated by attempts at artsiness.

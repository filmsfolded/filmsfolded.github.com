Spoilers herein.

Filmmaking has one immutable law: although a collaborative art, a coherent vision must result. That single vision is magic when it appears, transporting the viewer. Viewing films in a theater is a collaborative activity as well.

So when you find a film -- or better a persistent team -- that creates that sort of a world, it is cause for celebration. The Farrellys aspire to this capability -- and one can see how they are getting better with each film.

Humor is a seemingly necessary component which can form the primary lever -- the Cohens for instance create a physics based on whimsical self-reference. The Farrellys shoot lower, which means they have the potential of a larger audience, but they depend more heavily on the comedic skills of the performers.

It worked with 'Mary,' and failed with 'Irene' and here because the actors couldn't find the groove and that's because the groove wasn't deep enough. Proof can be found in Graham's character in 'Boogie Nights.' There the whole crew was able to get to a singular platform which each performer could exploit.

Not here.

Spoilers herein.

Two cameramen actually, so that among the everyday industrious events of life are included the photographing, editing and showing of this film. The self-reference has other dimensions as well: The rhythms and motions of the shots matching or contrasting with those found. Some symmetries: cutting hair/nails and cutting film, stitching clothes and film, recording the recording of events (marriage and divorce), machines (printing and transporting machines) and the machinery of film.

Leave it to the Soviets to take the manifesto of nonfiction art (much reincarnated) and cast in terms of proletarian activity and industry.

This is experimental, which means it is not a whole film.

There are only so many things you can do to punch up a story. One of them is of interest to me, a sort of "watcher" inside the story. And that's what we have here. 

The deal is that Grant's character watches first the girl, then the couple. There's a couple of kids that watch, a sort of running joke. Passersby watch. There's a Russian watcher who provides some plot devices because he is so bad at it.

Salted in are recorders and a crowd watching the proposal in the midst of a sporting event.

Pah, even with all that, none of it is done effectively and the movie as a whole sinks.

The designated cutie here is someone chosen only because of her long red hair and small nose.

Spoilers herein.

This film was from a period in which the definitions of and borderlines between genres was changing, perhaps the most in the history of film. This experiment is a 'safe' noir, where the viewer is returned to the fuzzy familiar world of the happy ending.

In other words, this movie is one thing that disguises itself as something else, something darker, more mysterious and less 'scientific' (meaning in this case, logical).

And the story is the same thing. Would be pretty interesting if their were at least one other element that was done well.

Spoilers herein.

There are lots of tiresome slasher films. But you can find some interesting elements,  either in the level or method of self-reference or (most usually) in the story behind the  story: why is the slasher doing it - and sometimes how and who.

What makes this so totally bad - quite apart from the poor production script and acting  (but then they all have that) - is that it has no underlying story. This guy just shows up.

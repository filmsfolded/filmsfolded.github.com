I missed the first one, and I suppose that's okay. 

If you do not know it, the gimmick is the same as "Speed," gosh more than 20 years ago. Something in the plot requires the action to be hyper, so the cinematic narrative is given an excuse to be frantic. 

Frantic can work. Frantic can be good. John Coltrane moving faster than my synapses is good. But then John Coltrane was doing what he did because he could lead the synapse firing architecture by being in the future before I could sort it out myself. To occupy that space and be something other than simply loud takes a greater talent than doing things slowly in the open. 

This has the basest cinematic reliance: it depends on clear, crystallized stereotypes, nothing else. Really, some motion and nothing else at all. So in watching it, I placed it in the company of similar films striving to reach a transmedia state through brute force. I am convinced that we are in the midst of a transition to a new, more intimate and effective media experience. I am also convinced that if in retrospect it will not seem to have sprung from movies, all the experimentation is happening in movies. 

This is merely one sparkle in a large fireworks burst, of no significance by itself.

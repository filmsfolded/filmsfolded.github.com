I believe that the lucid imagination puts their own markers in the public conceptual landscape. 

Regular readers know that many of these for me are films that anchor personal structure. But I have some books that do this as well, and probably at a more fundamental level. One of these is "Alice in Wonderland" and it is a minor game to recognize that work in contemporary copies.

This film is blatantly patterned after Alice. The two worlds, the vaginal transition. Mirrors, small doors. Animated flowers. Wicked queen. There's the business of returning to the origin by walking away and even the cat that advises. All of those bits are here, plus a dash of "Pinocchio." But there is another influence that may not be so obvious to you.

I encountered a very special piece of stop-motion work a couple years ago: "Blood Tea and Red String" which is also derived from Alice, has this surrogate ragdoll notion and also supports a storyline of capture for love. The stylistic elements in this later project clearly were influenced by that film which I gave my highest rating. So in watching this, I touched two of my most important markers, plus having the folded notion of one world similar to the other, but more magical except for artificial eyes. Its an example of Ted's law, one which may help to extend or better understand it.

The dimensionality of the thing -- advertised heavily in my area -- was trivial, uninteresting. It was a compelling show, owing to its structure. But you'll do better to go to the sources, I think.

Spoilers herein.

Opening scenes are seductions, promises. They transport one to the world of the story and establish who you as viewer can expect to be. Done right, they are an art to themselves. This film's opening is among the best I've seen, establishing the world of performance: politics as theater and love as both. It lets you know the perspective is centered on a stylized stage and concerns loss, sexually ambiguous brotherhood and betrayal. All in a couple minutes.

And then it unfolds. That unfolding is not wound tightly like the entry; it keeps the play outside the play notion, but epically sprawls. This is clearly a film worth watching, but not all the character/actor combinations are powerful enough to carry the epic scale.

There is something that bothers me. China is an old civilization with its own stylized conventions of storytelling. We somewhat see those in what is depicted on stage, but the film uses none of them, instead taking a strongly western stance. The dissonance is jarring, especially since so much is made of the symmetries between the film and the opera. This is somewhat true with the style of acting, but in that dimension I admit that innovation is near impossible. 

But the stance of the camera! We went through a dynastic-like period, a Japanese period, a brief nationalistic one, and then a couple iterations of mob totalitarianism (with a Soviet flavor). But except for the sets, nothing changed so far as the environment in which the narrative was presented. Should have, could have. Instead we have the Hollywood style as transferred through budget-conscious Hong Kong: Static camera, few setups, languorous editing.

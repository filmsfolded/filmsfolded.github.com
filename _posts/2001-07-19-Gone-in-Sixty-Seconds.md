Spoilers herein.

Cat's eye comments follow.

Having made a gallizion dollars making colorful wallpaper, Bruckheimer turns in this film to producing something to make his life worthwhile. And he produces a surprizingly sensitive study of class and angst. Obviously, his years of study have paid off: his form is Shakespearean -- to build a story around one character in two bodies. Following French filmmakers and recently Greenaway, he uses a homeopathic character study, the less time on the screen for our main characters, the more powerful.

The primary character is a valley girl, a girl of privilege, who has been sheltered her whole life. Never wanting for possessions, never being disciplined, never being loved. One day, she is having some friends over; these are similarly dead. purposeless people (apparently Bruckheimer has a fixation on this crowd). Drugs, sex, thin profundities. Then she encounters some guys stealing her Cadillac SUV. The encounter proves thrilling.

Fast forward, she has left her riches, become a homeless prostitute and addict. She seeks the thrills of car theft to recapture that one moment of escape. In that pursuit, we see her here joining a car theft ring composed of a bunch of morons. (This is underscored by using the same crowd of goofs to stand for both the current and past gang.) She needs to take stuff to validate her life. That need now transcends drugs, sex, will. There is a side plot about fraternal fidelity that builds the context for the mechanics of how gangs substitute for family.

In other words, this is a Breathless Breathless. It preaches that thrillseeking kills the mind and saps the spirit, and it does so by wrapping its message in thrills. Pretty intelligent, this.

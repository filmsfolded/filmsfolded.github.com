I have a special fondness of "girl coming of age" stories, especially when they deviate from the formula a bit. 

This particular one seems to have been a hit. It is remembered more fondly now that Julia has become a star and collected mass endearments.

But it is horrible by any measure except for the moderate appeal of the seaside town. Only two of the actors seem to really be acting: D'Onofrio and Taylor. Usually in such enterprises, the characters are given snappy or clever or engaging dialog.

The closest we get here is a fianc√© getting upset when her boyfriend renames his boat "Nympho" and the townspeople cheer at her tirade.

I dumped all over "Passionada" for being incoherent and compromising on the ending. It was clearly derived from this: cross-class romance, Portuguese girl and family, fishing, bigmouthed redhead.

And in all the things that matter, mainly charm, it has it all over this stagy confabulation. Some actors can literally be seen reading the words on the insides of their foreheads. The upper class boyfriend and owner of the pizza joint were embarrassing.

And this is during Julia's fat period, before her surgeries.

If you get stuck watching this, pay attention to how the buildings are used. Each existing structure is employed as supplement to character with more competence than anything else. Naturally, the only villain in the piece is an architect.

Spoilers herein.

Television exists as a sort of palliative, designed for small familiarities so that hawkers  can be inserted to make their pitches. Since the earliest days of radio, the formula for  familiarity has been to create simple characters that we meet every week. TeeVee made  these even simpler in their version of the "situation comedy," and in the sixties dispensed  with the plot altogether with "Laugh-In." That was a true innovation: character alone. SNL  made it hip in the early seventies, and then after a couple years lost the hipness.

Still, the notion of a funny character works in that medium, which I remind again is a  palliative designed for selling stuff.

How to transfer to a film? Mike Meyers knows that film is essentially about itself, so you  should make a movie that goofs on movies and incidentally has your funny guy in it.

They didn't learn that here. To the funny guy bit they added the most standard of TeeVee  guy/girl plots. The whole thing is a waste of neurons.

Except. Except for one scene of about four minutes that is incongruously shoehorned in.  It involves Julianne Moore and was almost certainly written by her.

Julianne is one of our master actresses; that means she knows that much of what she  does has to be a matter of self-reference. So in comes the Ladies' Man to her  dressingroom: Julianne the actress plays an actress, getting ready to perform. She goes  behind a screen and emerges as a horny clown and does a bit so funny that it shows the  rest of the movie as just something waiting for a commercial.

You have to know her other work to appreciate this, but if you do it is precious. Not  worth $30 though.

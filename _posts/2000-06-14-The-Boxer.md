This film has a finely constructed drama, well acted (with two very effective actors). So why am I unsatisfied? Because this could just as well have been a play or a TV show. There's no FILM in this film.

It used to be that if the camera wasn't stationary with only a few positions, we'd notice. Now, the opposite is the case. The old style of doing things -- as used here -- creates a distance between viewer and actor that cannot be bridged by even the heaviweight characters we have in 'The Boxer.' The editing is unobtrusively predictable, and the framing of shots apparently accidental.

The Irish -- especially Irish storytellers -- deserve better support in the art of storytelling via film. There's a distinct excess of discipline and lack of passion. Seems more Nordic than Gaelic.

Young filmmakers send me films or point me to them, and it is always a matter of trepidation. Young talent needs to be both encouraged and challenged, but the internet is a poor medium for making the prerequisite human connections. The only way to communicate therefore is through the art itself.

It is easy enough to say that the filmmaker shows talent. Also that it is clear that he masters less than he believes. It is equally apparent that there is too much here, too much packed in. This is movie video territory, not an exploration of long form. The most rewarding filmmakers don't need to dazzle. They can use their cinematic competence as the foundations and let things unfold at a pace that is subtly negotiated with the viewer.

That said, this is a very good movie video - type short: several layers of existence each imagining, dreaming or recalling the others. The attractions of sex, the disgust at gluttony. If this had more shape, one could see it as a Joycean element done through the Keislowski mirror.

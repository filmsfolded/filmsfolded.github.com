On several script girl's office walls are different versions of the same chart. Its a derivation of Earl Gardner's wheel he used to compose his Perry mason stories. The idea here is that there are only a few threads to weave into a story of a certain type and only so many ways to put them together.

You need to know this chart. When you consume a story made from one of these, whether it is explicitly used or not, you die a little. You literally die, energy from your soul being sucked into a vortex to anchor those parts of the world we all need for safety.

You die for the common peace, but you die.

The three threads in this little thing are more obvious because there's been less elaboration than usual, fewer decorations of jokes.

This particular spin of the wheel gives you a fat/thin finding yourself story (probably only because fat suit technology has advanced so much.) And it has a big city versus heartland component, duly acted out by human representatives.

And then there's the date movie piece. Boy has girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back with uplifting music.

As with many of these things, the text is to "be yourself," to not copy a pattern in order to achieve. But it itself is a clich√© swirl.

Sophomoric profundities. And what are they?

--Dogma about verity and the omniscience of the camera. Done much better with 'The Limey,' in terms of the faceted eye. And mined as a subject itself in "Snake Eyes."

--Self-reference about people in the film imagining that they are in a film. Done so much better in dozens of films -- the ones that come immediately to mind are the ambitiously conceived 'Nurse Betty,' the truly cinematic 'Sex, Lies and Videotape,' even the glossy-arty 'American Beauty.'

--The tragic grind of fate. Done better (plus self-reference to film studies) in the recent 'Hamlet,' the one with Hawke and Stiles.

The songs did not work for me, did not transport. And that's strange since this is supposed to be deeply welling from the visual.But it is not very visual. Think how much better the effect of 'Drowning by Numbers' was.

Bjork DID work for me. The strongest criticism I have heard of her performance was they she was fey. Yes, and damning too, but that's all right with me in this case because she is risking her soul. And that is something one can't avoid watching. What is truly interesting is the self-referential nature of her performance. She (Bjork) is only effective because she imagines herself to be in a movie.

A final comment, which I am surprised to not have seen before. It may be difficult for a Scandinavian to appreciate, but one cannot do a piece about tragedy in the US, a piece about sweatshop factory labor in the 50's, a piece about the penal system, without including blacks. There are essentially none here, minus one (two?) of the Danish dancers. (The friend was supposed to be black, and I suppose we are better off without a completely artificial character.)

The DVD documentary on the choreographing is much more 'dogma' than the film itself.

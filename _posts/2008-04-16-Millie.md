This is in black and white of course, so you cannot tell the hair color. But everyone would have known this actress to be redhead. Its mentioned about a dozen times in the dialog and in the middle is a song written for her that celebrates the fact.

Its one of a class of films about lovers separated and becoming party animals, discovering their unhappiness, and then refining their love. They are all a bit clumsy. Most have a trusted observer in the story, usually a trusted friend. The novelty here that there are two trusted friends, both lovers. One returns as a a true friend, the other (the one with a mustache) is a cad.

It revolves around the fact that all men are dishonest in love, and like them all, it wraps up quickly with some sort of redemption. 

There isn't anything cinematic or otherwise remotely imaginative.

Its precode and involves loose sex, and one lesbian pair. But in terms of what is considered sex in today's movies (skin, simulated sex) its tame.

I'm a bit attracted to movies that are bizarre, not bizarre because they are planned that way, but because they are so abstract, so refined, so dependent on movieworld shorthand that they lose connection with us and we have to sit outside in awe instead of inside the story.

This is so abstract its almost experimental. Others have commented that the story makes no sense at all, which is sort of true.

There's an inventor. When mentioned, his (adult) daughter says of him that he's the man who invented a cosmic ray that (somehow) gives great power. As with many movies, the idea is on paper which is being sought by evildoers (new word, that). The idea itself doesn't seem to exist, nor does it seem possible that the scientist that invented it (who does appear) could know it apart from that singular piece of paper. 

I like this because it is an element of abstraction in the story that reflects a similar notion in how the story is abstracted as notation. There is a comedic pair, more unreal than, say Jerry Lewis or Abbot and Costello ever were. There are a passel of folks in a remote warehouse, all (but one) of whom turn out to be detectives of some kind. There is an apparently trained giant octopus under the partial control of the evil stealer of paper. She is transformed in a very effective special effect from an appearance that denotes a kindly aunt to a witch. Same face, slightly different makeup. A lesson in notation, almost as if the transforming ray was aimed at her.

The gag is simple. Start with a private, exclusive girl's school, something the Brits inexplicably call a "public" school. Then transform it into something criminally mischievous. At once you get the two mainstays of British humor: reversals in class and sexual tweaks.

Since nearly all movies of this type are gag movies, the story is disposable, only allowing the situation to be displayed. Its a bit delicate though.

In this first of the series, the class token is chosen as someone safe, an oil sheik. And the sex bit is far, far more subdued than in later episodes. The only one I have seen, "Blue Murder," the next, suggests the older girls are running a brothel. There, you have solid knicker jokes. Here you only have a soccer game inserted so you can see their figures.

Since these girls are depicted as undefeatable, the situation ends up pitting the fourth grade against the sixth, since they back different horses in a race.

One wonders whether this was done the Ealing way, by consulting a chart of comic situations, or the ordinary way by intuitive brainstorming.

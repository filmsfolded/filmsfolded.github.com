Part con movie, part revenge story, this is yet another example of how scriptwriters can splice genres together.

The con movie is one of the most interesting in all filmdom. Our lives are occupied with the creation and inhabiting of a story. Films are the major supplier of stuff for this process. So it is particularly cool when a film overtly features a story that one character spins for another unknowing rube. Always there is a twist as we viewers shift from the awareness space of the rube (as we have been similarly fooled) to that of the on screen author. Few things are more engaging than knowing that the investment you are making in the narrative is frangible, and will be broken in some unexpected way, planned by a noir-like force outside your control.

In this case, the twist escapes the noir constraint and our hapless nobody gains control. Quite literally: we see at the beginning the writing of the story we see. At the end we literally read it and then twist it as a coda to the ordinary twist. 

That last twist is unexpected, and a bit of a joy because the folding is so literal. (Our guy is an ad writer who earlier was sacked because he "didn't follow the script.") But until then we have it cloaked as a simple revenge movie, a subgenre that I believe is the necessary counterpoint to the great invention of noir from which there is no escape.

Cassal snarls.

Spoilers herein.

'The Muppet Movie' was an important film and is one my must watch list. That's because  it is remarkable in its self-reference. It is about the making of itself with many clever  observations along the way. It is possibly the most intelligent thing you can show your  kids that they will believe is made for them.

This film is equally intelligent. It references the first by making a show and takes us  behind the scenes 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' -like. And it has lots and lots of camp  references to genres, all genres as far as I can tell.

Sure, it is full of ridiculous sex and violence, just as the genres it spoofs. This, 'Heavenly  Creatures' and 'Forgotten Silver' are worth watching. All else from him is portion  controlled restaurant food.

"Death to Smoochy" could have stood some of this fearlessness.

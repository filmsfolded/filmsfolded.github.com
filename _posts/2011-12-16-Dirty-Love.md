What an entertaining movie!

I share the critical consensus, that it is poorly made and a failure in all its intended dimensions. But I watch movies a different way, and that allows me to get a lot out of it. In this case, it matters that this is Jenny McCarthy's project.

If you do not know her, she was a nude model with artificial breasts who achieved the golden prize, the 'Playmate of the Year.' She was able to create a marketable persona as a lovable ditz. Later, she would become a spokesperson for one of the more dangerous ignorant memes; that vaccines caused her son's autism. What is salient here is that she is a dumb model with an act like the early Goldie Hawn and who married a filmmaker.

She gets enough leverage to make her own movie. This was written by her; she plays the main role and her husband directs. So what is it about? Both sides of her: a vacuous supermodel who has no understanding of 'real love' and who spends the movie involved in embarrassing his hapless lover. She physically plays that target, who is a photographer like her husband..

Among the embarrassments we are supposed to find comedic: her jilted tantrums; being vomited on; publicly slipping in a pool of her menstrual blood; having her breasts exposed in public; volunteering for casual sex with a couple losers; any number of silly 'girl talk' episodes; an extended drugtaking sequence and the final wrapup (where she finds her true love) triggered by a ridiculous belief in fortunetelling.

To emphasize the embarrassments, we have two on-screen observers in her roommates, also extreme stereotypes. One, played by Kam Heskin, is actually effective because it finds the comedic balance Jenny misses.

So, the fold here is simple: a woman's real life, exploited by her. It is supposed to leverage a dumb blond stereotype on screen and fails, but succeeds if you know that the created it herself.

Some westerns are carefully designed to emphasize one strong element that makes westerns what they are: the interface of man with the land. Its why we have so many farmers versus ranchers movies, I think. The folks behind this grind this into a potion, grabbing every element that they can. There's the story of course: about loyalty to the land regardless of the sacrifice. Even about the land as woman. We have Jane who understands this with her gait, her face, her body. And Robards who understands less and has a borderline silly plot line to carry that conflates sex with Jane and drilling on the land.

She really is fearless, projected more then than now, because at that point she was the prevailing "sex kitten." She is the earth, the land.

But much more profound is what Pakula has done with the horsework. The two leads, so far as one can tell, do their own riding. And what riding it is! I doubt if anyone has captured more complex movement of men and animals n terrain, often hilly. There are scenes that today would be done with animated cattle I suppose because they really do control these beasts. Actors! Except that when they do these things, they are doing it full out as selves -- there is no barrier in these scenes. We see Jane and James no more acting than the horses are.

It has to be one of the most dynamically honest cinematic capturing of human and terrain, surely that I have seen. If you have a chance, See this with "Straight Story." Farnsworth has the type of death in this film that I suppose he would want to be remembered for. Its noble. Its married to the place. Its just how he carried himself in that last movie where he knew he was dying.

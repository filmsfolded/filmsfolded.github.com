Spoilers herein.

Ed Norton has ambitions. He's done some resonant acting and now tries his hand at shaping a picture. He chose a comedy/drama which is on the hard side, but he chose do work on the simplest, smallest level. And he surrounded himself with competent actors.

The notion is simple, but the script chooses to not exploit any element of the possibilities. Everything is so watered down, you have very little left except a few jokes. There's no picture. There's no relentless focus. (See 'the Pledge,' for an example of how high Ed should shoot.)

Two actors interested me. I don't watch TeeVee so don't know her. She lacked magic in EdTV. Here she really does well. It is a simple character, but she grows it from inside, so when she shines you feel warm. That's her job and she does it well. I kept thinking of her as a Gwyneth who knows how to use her face. Hope she doesn't get stuck being cute.

Bancroft is a blot. Since the director wasn't in charge, she elected to do her patented shtick. Offensive.

Norton played parallel roles on top of each other in 'Fight Club,' so we know he's interested in folded texture. I kept seeing him trying to make his plastic priest into something more. I'd say this was a directorial failure because he didn't see that the story was weak, didn't have the moxie to overcome it and didn't have a clear vision of how to direct himself.

I see he's optioned 'Motherless Brooklyn.' He's going to have to come a long way to get around that one directorially.

Spoilers herein.

I am amazed at films like this. You know them: say, the story about a teenager learning that life is not about superficialities but the film relies on the most stereotypical and superficial conventions to tell its story. You wonder: is the form so much of a formula that no senior participant see what they are doing?

Now along comes aging groupie Bogdonovich, who purports to know the inner workings of Hitchcock and Wellesian rebellion because he spent time with them. He thinks he knows Hollywood because he's made pictures (one of which seemed novel). He thinks he understands infatuation with perky pixies because he is has that addiction himself. He thinks he has the dramatic 'eye.'

And so we are delivered with this oafish project. Every scene, every element, even every set dressing is presented in a deliberate, plodding, obvious, explicit manner. It starts with the pseudonoir narrative and is nailed home with a very long fade from coffin to similarly sized and colored yacht. Wink wink; nudge nudge. Every development is contrived and bluntly staged. No educated eye is used. The lessons of Wells and Hitchcock are ignored despite the ample opportunities afforded by the boat. That prompts some viewers to think this was deliberately 'old school.' Look again folks: he uses the same angle and lighting playbook as everyone, rejecting anything that might be honest, fresh or clever.

I must admit that there are some competent shots which pass the motion from one player to another. But since Altman, that's part of the standard vocabulary. I also admit that Dunst has some charm here. But the part revolves around the assumption of a charm of a different sort. What's assumed is some cuteness, with superficial caprice but deliberation underneath. What Dunst gives us is opportunistic caprice all the way down. A good director would have rejected this or repaired it because the whole drama revolves around this disconnect.

Every other player tromps through with relatively high professionalism. But the director seems to have had no high level view of the orchestrated whole and instead collaborated independently and differently with each player. That sort of worked with 'Picture Show' where the whole point is daft kids playing roles that bump up against each other. Doesn't work here. No.

You know, there is some fine movie-making in porn, exploitation and other stupidfilm categories.

In this case, it the first few moments of storytelling. In general, a film has a only a short time to establish itself as a world and to slip you in precisely where the filmmaker wants. Think of it as the face of the thing.

Watch this otherwise uninteresting beast as it introduces itself. See how efficiently we are introduced to the reason for the story: the doctor, his skills, this new invention of a "hypo - dermic" needle, mention of Conan Doyle and the backstory of his lost romance. All in a few minutes.

Consider this the "face" of the story. An attractive one to a hollow inside.

The story (since you probably won't watch this) is:

A handsome man performs a gruesome chore for money and has his face frozen in a death grimace. He wears a mask to cover this. With his new wealth he acquires a beautiful wife who happens to be the lost love of the doctor. Oh, and the doctor also happens to be the world's expert on restoring frozen muscles. Natch, natch, natch.

He comes and restores the face via psychosomatic means, but the restored state is frozen shut, so our evil count dies horribly. Ho Hum. Barely enough for a Twilight Zone episode.

So it is padded with all sorts of evil doings of our count. Seems the devilish face has given him a devilish soul. Oh, if only the marvelous face of this movie had given us an equally fine film.

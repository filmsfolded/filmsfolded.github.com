Spoilers herein.

I have found a Wong film that I cannot recommend. I thought it wouldn't happen: I've seen 'Fallen Angels,' 'In the Mood for Love' and 'Chunking Express.' These are works of a visionary mystic. The first two are especially brilliant. 'Angels' moves faster than our mind can adjust to the world, shifting among narrators and narrative modes; 'Mood' is at the other extreme, minimal, repetitive, moving deeply under our ability to follow a narrative thus provoking an altered state. Both take huge risks in opposite directions. Both are highly intellectual in how they refer to themselves and their making within the story. 

'Happy' is placed in between the two in terms of risk, no barrage but no meditation. And along the way, no self-reference except the brief smell of sobs on a tape played at a lighthouse at the end of the world. Its a great image, but not integrated into the Jarmusch-like flow of drifting lives. There's still the visual poetry, but it isn't shaped to have power here, not like his other projects, not like his stuff that is reinventing our imagination. Please go to those other projects if you have not yet.

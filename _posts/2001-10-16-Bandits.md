Spoilers herein.

Here is another intelligently conceived notion, ruined by an uncentered director; having a dozen producers may have had something to do with it.

Levinson has some skill. He does some interesting camera management, which keeps us occupied. And he does understand what's going on, as the writing is pretty cleverly structured. He just has no center.

The cleverness comes from two things: the elaborate framing and Ms Cate's games.

The framing is rather studied: We are given two Dylan songs right off the bat that concern someone acting out well enough that the act becomes life. A Dylan strength, at least before the fundamentalist excesses. Then we actually have Kate the character who wants to become a singer, and this develops first into a fantasy and then beyond to the con. Song lyrics both annotate the action and are woven into the dialog. I'll bet the script idea started with those Dylan songs.

We have the conventional framing of a noir-narrator's flashback. Ho Hum, but that is deftly woven into another common device, the film as an extension of a film within itself: a televised interview that contains the 'story.' Which incidentally is partly told through bank surveillance cameras -- and in one case, the camera of someone filming singers! Very good folding joke. More: one character (Billy) is highly suggestable, so the other character (Bruce) toys with him by feeding him suggestions about 'dis-eases' that then become real.

This is pretty crafty stuff, and the execution is well conceived in the casting too: Bruce and Billy are superficial actors. They act by 'putting on' their characters -- while keeping their 'real' selves just visible. The 'real' Bruce often winks out at the audience in his roles, which is something we post-postmodern audiences like. So we pay them truckloads of dough. What they play here is -- you guessed it, men who put on disguises and with genteel manners walk away with scads of cash.

It only works because of Cate, who is one of the three most intelligent actresses in film today. She comes to a role by actually transforming her soul, at least a much of it as we can see. So when she is bereft, looking for an alternate reality, we not only believe, we climb aboard. She is so charming and open we believe -- and conspire in -- creating the film to suit her needs, even if it means concocting these two prancing oafs.

Bottom line: even Levinson's clumsiness cannot dampen the conspiracy the gifted Cate weaves with this clever writer.

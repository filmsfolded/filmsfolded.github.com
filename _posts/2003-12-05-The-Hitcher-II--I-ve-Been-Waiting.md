Spoilers herein.

The original of this was very clever. It introduced a particularly economical version of the  stalker, and it did so with introspection. What the hitcher did to the kid is what the  filmmaker does to the viewer. And it used Hauer in precisely the way that emphasized  that folding by citing his 'Bladerunner' character.

The transference of paranoia was about as complete and perfect as one could imagine.

Now comes this. It is like a high school tramp: it resembles all the 'grown up' stuff, and  may even be recklessly committed. But it lacks any meaning or soul. Even 'House of  1,000 Corpses' tried what this doesn't.

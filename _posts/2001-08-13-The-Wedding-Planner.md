Spoilers herein.

Cat's eye comments* follow:

This is a story about the crisis in the North American economy with services replacing manufacturing. Two women (women as creators) compete for the same trophy husband. The potential groom represents the health care dollar, which is the economic sector most at risk in this competition.

The manufacturing sector is represented by a blond woman of northern European origin. She was born as middle class and worked her butt off to create a business (in processed food, the most fundamental manufacturing). She has created substantial primary wealth and can in a sense buy her husband.

The services sector is represented by an equally earnest woman. She also works her butt off. Oops! Well, she works hard. She is represented by a southern European character. As with all service businesses, she must chase the dollars created by real wealth, so she is cast in the position of facilitating the acquisition of health care by manufacturing. And hating her lack of fulfillment.

But wait! The movie business enters in a sly selfreference. The Doctor never had as much fun in his life as when dancing to an old movie and because of this 'memory' he chooses the service sector.

Moral: If you are in a business that does not create primary wealth, and you want to capture society's primary assets, do so using the influence of film.

(*Cat's eye comments result when the primary narrative of a film is so formulaic, so trivial that nothing intelligent can be said of it. In such a case, we comment on the deconstructed secondary narrative.)

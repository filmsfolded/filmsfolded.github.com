Spoilers herein.

I dread the Robin Williams projects. Its not so much him, as long as he doesn't give us any more grieving husband retreads. No, it is all the fuss that is made around him to focus on an exaggerate his apparent quirkiness. The man does know a few things about energy and how it affects the engine of self. But most of what we get out of his characters comes from others: the lighting, makeup, design, strange notes in the script, even adaptive reactions by other actors. To see how powerful this effect is, pay attention to Williams' voiceover as narrator. See how ordinary it is, how inapt it is at conveying what is intended, how poor the rhythm. Now contrast that with his on-screen presence, where the world is engineered to support him. Striking.

But in this case, the interesting thing isn't the story or the acting, nor any of that. It is the example, yet another one, of a growing acceptance in mainstream film of the notion of explicit self-reference. That's where we have a collection of images made about the making of a collection of images, usually film or photography. (Another thread are performances about performances.)

In such self-reference, the voyeurism of the character is folded into our own voyeurism in watching what is going on. A clever writer will trick us into believing the character to be right until the end where he and us are revealed for what we are. And so we have here. I remark that the self-reference is particularly explicit, but in this case not particularly well done, because no moral ambiguity is introduced. I understand that such a thing was part of the original project, but as with all Hollywood efforts now, test audiences and 'protect-the-investment' strategies washed it all out.

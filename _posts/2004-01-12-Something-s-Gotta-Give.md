Spoilers herein.

I admit, I am a sucker for films like this -- films which rely entirely on the smart reading  of snappy dialog.

The story -- as most love stories -- is just filler to allow the filmmaker to do something  else, usually charm by various shortcuts. Beach, kitchen, bedroom. Here it is filler to  allow some very practiced actors to snap and pop to fresh timing.

Comedic timing changes over time. Like music, it depends on expectations based on less  clever humor. So Jack today has to calibrate himself differently than even five years ago.  To get the same breezy wink today, he has to do something quite different to make it  seem the same.

This is hard to test because when you see one of his older movies, what you see is what  you remember -- not what is really there. But he his different here. He uses his neck  folds as part of his face, one of the few instances I know where the elements of the  instrument have actually increased in number.

Watch the way he winks to himself as he talks to Diane on their way back from their first  walk. He is talking to her by talking to himself at the same time that he is having another  conversation with himself physically. He works harder as he gets older, different than  almost any celebrated actor.

There are quite a few jarringly false moves here: Diane's yip when his blood pressure  registers good; her cries when writing, the obligatory leave-em-smiling ending. But there  are enough well managed moments for me to expect to see much of this subconsciously  quoted in future comedies -- especially in the timing.

Check out the syncopation among different parts of Jack's face and the words he speaks.  Each of those dozen parts plays a role, each one setting a beat as if each finger in a  chord was playing with its relation to others in coming a tiny bit before or after,  differently each time. Facial comedy. Nothing like it in the world.

Almost as if to underscore that this is all about faces, there is only one piece of physical  humor: when Jack falls off Diane's bed when she returns from her date.

I make a special study of folding in films. A simple fold is when a writer writes about a  writer, writing about the story you see. The play within overlaps the movie and in this  case outside the movie since we know the director wrote it. Three women writers  overlap.

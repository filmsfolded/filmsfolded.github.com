I had forgotten about this, about what it meant and how it affected many of us when it was new.

The reason I had forgotten was that I have seen many of the following Rambo movies. There, the characters are not people, but collected concepts of institutional evil (always nonwhite) and violent justice. People, even Rambo, appear in the things as part of the motion, icons to show us that the battle is ongoing. Sly himself has become a cartoon, a buffoon who (we suppose) is no more in control of himself than a bullet in flight. We come to the Rambo sequels -- and similar movies -- when we need a visceral shot of self-approval for rooting for the good guy. Justice has always been affirmed by this feeling, this notion of post- testosterone-overflow rightness.

In many cases, we even speak of it as if it were connected with blood, even the blood of your god. I understand those later films, but it was a shock to be reminded that this first one is -- or was -- something quite different.

The nation was divided in a profound and lasting way that endures (and is actively sustained) today. There were many factors, but the Viet Nam "police action" became the focus. I think this is because Hollywood during and after WW II ended up helping Americans define the narrative of what it meant to be an American. It placed a packageable notion of goodness in a suitable situation of nationhood. Because the US had no single racial identity that others we defeated had, the notion of a "real" (meaning white Christian) American was fabulated, together with a notion of collected "values," that previously were incidental and unrelated. 

Hollywood's war gave understanding and thereby meaning. People felt good about themselves. The economy flourished; racism became more vile; political movements were born. 

So when we ended up in Viet Nam without thinking, these "values" polarized a people. One group clung to this notion of honor in the blood, the other reacting to it, mostly just as a reaction. But one group had the guns, the White House, the lies and a resurgence of fundamentalist Christianity. 

This film marks a major shift in that public meme. Watching it, I am amazed at how incoherent it is, how slapdash, how poorly made. No one involved would make a decent film afterward. But the viewers of 1982 were so hungry for some resolution of a divided nation, we imposed our own irrepressible narrative on this and found peace in a different sort of broken narrative.

On one side, you have the "family values" small town real America who wants things simple. Half of America thought of this as "Wonderful Life" America and half as "Deliverance" America. Here we have the Deliverence variety. Into this walks the guy that until that moment in history would have been a walking icon of their ideals, a backslapped god, a paragon, a hero. But he is rejected. 

When he turns on the town, a whole cosmology of self-identification shifted. (Incidentally, the action movie was born.) The polar opposites until then had been stable.

On one side: valor, Jesus, war, small town goodness, order in law, Caucasian simplicity, competence, the flag. On the other side, let's just simply say opposition.

In the film we now had on one side the small town, the law and exclusively white faces. But all the value was sucked out of it. Now the opposition had the competence, the justice, the flag (in an ambiguous way), and racial diversity (at the beginning in a safe way). The film when new was this radical inversion, and audiences went nuts cheering for Rambo. He actually kills no one, carefully so and we all took note. Everyone in the nation was affected by this relatively incompetent thing.

Interestingly, the meme collection snapped back more strongly than ever. Today we have the very same polarization, stronger than before. The same clean division, driven by the coherent narrative of religion, fundamentals, flag, whiteness, violent justice with demagoguery, active wars and TeeVee networks.

We need a "First Blood" film for our times. One that will stick. One that will help people understand what drives them. One that will not simply produce a new, useless genre.

Incidentally, so powerful was the icon of Rambo's knife-of-justice, that Paul Hogan was able to make his own blockbuster movie "Crocodile Dundee" based on one scene with that knife.

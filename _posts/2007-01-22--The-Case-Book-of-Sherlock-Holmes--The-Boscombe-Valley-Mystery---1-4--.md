Now here's an example of a Holmes adaptation that is almost precisely as in the story. Inspector Lestrade is substituted by a more gentle fellow for some reason, and a key clue (the cry of "Cooee") is absent. But by and large this contains every element of the story and nearly every line of dialog. 

And its pretty bad storytelling. If there was ever an example of how the detective mechanics of books and film differ, its here. This isn't the worst of the Brett adaptations. But it lacks energy. And Brett of course is in a funk himself.

What makes it truly pleasant is the sets. Everything about this is ordinary except the sets which someone really made into complex, clever, interesting and beautiful spaces. Every shot is set is a wonderful place shown wonderfully.

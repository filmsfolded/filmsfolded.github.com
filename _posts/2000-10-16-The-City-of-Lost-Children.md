This film has a fascinating set design philosophy. The idea is to use a sparse sense of retro machinery (rivets everywhere), and lots of water, stark lighting and not overly creative framing. It also has a competent score. Both attempt to support a creative stance that is, alas poorly structured.

The problem is that there is no core vision. At root, we have an attempt to make a deeply self-referential vision: a dream stolen from your own self-conscious and presented as a story about the same, with deep symbolic hooks. The idea has great potential, but fails. The problems are two:

--the images are not deep enough. The evil is thin. The characters are stereotypes, not the archetypes the drama requires. These should grab and puzzle; instead they introduce and act predictably. Also the drama has many discontinuous fragments that are never harmonized, nor presented as dreamlike discontinuities. Its just thrown up at us as the result of partially digested cartoon gluttony. Would have been better to steal from Dickens than Stan Lee.

--there's an attempt to be humorous, and this undercuts the primary goal at every turn. Every single image or vignette has the filmmakers winking at us as if to say, "You know we're not serious here. Isn't this cute?" Gilliam knows to hide the humor. Greenaway knows how to disturb with depth. Here, we have the Tim Burton syndrome. It should have been well enough known to avoid by 1995.

I usually give a lot of credit to films which shoot high and fail. But these people only pretend to shoot high and so fail in an uninteresting way. Yet another example of the bankrupt system of French film subsidy: you have to promote the "French" view. Whatever that is, it maps poorly to this type of creative endeavor.

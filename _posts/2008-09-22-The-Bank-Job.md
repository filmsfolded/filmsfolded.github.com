There is a good movie in this that was stolen from us, a darn good one I think. It dives into several well defined story areas: the heist film, the con film, the story that is drawn by sex (here in multiple ways). The business about multiple watchers in the noir mold manipulating the situation so it comes down to a battle of the watchers. Dueling photos and records. The cleverness of Brer Rabbit as he escapes once again, here played by someone we expect to have qualities we associate with that character.

But what we get is bits and pieces of five or six probably successful movies. The sexual center around whom all the urges revolve is played by Saffron Burrows, who I think is capable of this. She's done something like this role before. But here she is directed into a shape of mystery that is not natural to her, and she comes off as just another of the women in the story, drifting.

Like so many failed projects, you can watch this with the intent of wondering what you would adjust to make it work. I think I would defer the revealing of the multiple cons and doublecons until later, and have Saffron be simply as alluring as she can be. I would have made less of the Oceans 11 references, and more of the Guy Richie stuff.

Two scores, battling for control. Simple stuff, but this could have been a winner.

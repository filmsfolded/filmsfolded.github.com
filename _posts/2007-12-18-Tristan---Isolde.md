I guess when a film tries to be nothing more than a simple story, it gets extra points from me. Because I actually enjoyed this. But then again there were large parts of Waterworld that I liked.

The story didn't get in the way for me. It was so predictable that it became invisible. Who goes to the opera for the story? The fights and all that, feh.

It was the cinematography that was good. Yes, there were grand postcard views. Ordinary in type, but then nature is too in that way. Its still magnificent when you see it. 

No, the thing that charmed me was the way the cinematographer framed the thing, quite personally. Shifting between having space be central (with people in it) to the other way around. I was puzzled by this: it just seemed too good. I knew the Scotts were the people who assembled this and assumed that they found someone special or perhaps mentored someone. 

Afterward I looked it up. And holy cow, I was right! A Polish cinematographer, and what I was seeing was after the fashion of Kieslowski. Its not as personal; it couldn't be because the story is so blocked. But you just cannot escape how Kielslowski turns a camera into an instrument that loves life, breath, being.

The story is about such things. Its blunt and simple. But the use of the eye here is not. I don't know how long it will last, this specialness of filmpoles. But it is special.

Spoilers herein.

I'm getting more and more familiar with the disconnect among these three things: a good film, a good idea for a film and a good idea about a film. I think these are often unrelated. I know that many bad movies are worthwhile for me because I take away some interesting thought about it.

But there are lots and lots of movies where you can just tell that it started with a clever idea and good intentions. Then for whatever reasons, it just falls apart - perhaps because of studio bosses or inadequate talent or the money ran out or the experiment failed.

I suppose the original idea here was no less fertile than Big Chill, Stand by Me, City Slickers or Rats Meet Henry. Set it up and let references to other films waft by and deal with them skitlike. It could have worked. It was a good idea. All movies are about other movies anyway.

I think in this case, the actors simply had no skit talents.

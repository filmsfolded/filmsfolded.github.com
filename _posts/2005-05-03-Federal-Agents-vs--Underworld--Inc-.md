This is a Republic serial, which is to say that it is tedious watching. You'll find everything about this cheap and unimaginative. The device this time is an evil woman who has one of a pair of golden hands. Obtaining the second and solving a puzzle will result in untold riches. The "underworld" (meaning the criminal class) is involved.

It moves only as far as a car explosion or a capture and then resets until the last chapter. The only interesting thing about this was the evil villain, played by Carol Forman. Hard to believe it but moviegoers of the time actually saw the characters more on lobby posters than on the screen. Though Carol never appeared in a color movie that I know, everyone knew her as a brilliant redhead.

She's no great actress, and this is no great story. But even though she's not given many villainessy things to do, she's a great villain, memorable. Or so it seemed in the day.

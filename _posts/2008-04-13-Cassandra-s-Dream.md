I imagine Woody has a very strict, self-imposed schedule. He doesn't have much time, and other logistical factors determine when and how often films get made. So if a project hasn't been fully ripened, that fact is just ignored. I believe it sharpens him -- or so he thinks -- to have to mature things in the process of bearing them.

But sometimes its pretty obvious, as it is here.

We know that he is obsessed with surveying the forms of narrative. Unlike Welles except with his Annie hall period, he's more interested in inhabiting those forms than twisting them. He's a curious visitor, a player of known forms using his own jazz riffs in the small. (Uninvolved commentors think of this as a focus on dialog.)

This is his second adventure in traditional Greek drama. We know if from the boat's name, deliberately dropped before anything happens. Its in the dialog where a character invented just to say it asks what Greek dramatists are preferred. With another week of preparation, Woody would have worked the idea of us watching a drama with the notion of our hero's seduced by the actress he sees in a play with her nude, copulating. Past experience tells me that he would also have referenced performance in the restaurant -- the inevitability of that place is already there.

And the hotels of course, contrasted with the notion of caprice in gambling.

So what we have these days is half-baked projects, made so by this relentless schedule, and made palatable by the skills of everyone involved. I admit, they are first class.

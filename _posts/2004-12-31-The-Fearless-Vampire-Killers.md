What does it take to be a filmmaker? I mean apart from the craft of the thing.

I think there are two different types of answers depending on who you think you are and how the world is put together. I suppose the most common answer would be that you have to have the innate sense of a master storyteller. God knows, there are scandalously few of them, especially in the theatrical world, and no amount of training or gloss can hide that. 

My answer would be a bit different. The kind of films that register with me are those that are placed midway between my own visual memories and the images and threads I imagine to recall my dreams. I suppose this is what most people mean when they say that someone has a visual imagination, or is inherently cinematic. I don't want a spoken narrative illustrate with pictures. I don't want actors animating characters that can be described. I don't need the story to even "add up." I need it to connect.

For some reason, Polish and Spanish-speaking filmmakers possess this cinematic ability to connect more than others. On beyond logic, to a place that Italian, Italian-American and French filmmakers just don't know.

Why mention this? Because even though Polanski often produces a drafty product, you can always sense that his eye is magical. Yes, even in this silly, half-baked scone of a movie. Yes, he had a supremely competent cinematographer, but not one known for art. And he had an amazing location. But just see what this young man did with how he staged and framed the story.

There's not much to say about the story itself except that he understood that Vampire movies never are about the vampire (who is not really a character but an embodiment of force), but about the girl. And she should be redheaded, as he has made his naturally blond lover here.

Of minor interest is the peculiarly Polish humor about Jews. No American can do it, regardless of their Yiddish background, and few of us can appreciate it. But that's our vaudeville legacy, right down to the horny old Jewish vampire dragging the corpse of his dead blond buxom maid into a borrowed crypt for a quickie. And the daftness of the Einstein professor lookalike.

Spoilers herein.

It must be quite a challenge to create films to feed a distinct audience of any kind. You can only go so far with stories about gangstas, earnest kid transcends the ghetto, black dating plots, Eddie Murphy farts, and Denzel 'pride' movies. This at least attempts to be respectful, working to tread the line between poking fun and building warm appreciation. The makers of this treaded so carefully, they made a film so tepid it is unwatchable. Thats the dilemma.

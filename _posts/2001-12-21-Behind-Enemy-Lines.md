The first thing to ask is what is the center? With this film, the center is in the camera-work, and the frantic editing. This makes it similar to 'Spy Game,' which had a more consistent nervousness. This one plays with lots of styles, from war correspondent hand-held while running, to the clean choreography of the attack on the F-18. Until the end, very effective.

The acting and story are mere excuses. They don't matter and a good thing too -- Hackman is more and more living up to his name. I'm intrigued by Owen. He gives an arythmic, unexpected reading of lines that seems deliberate. In preparation for this, I viewed 'Minus Man,' in which he has the same odd lilt.

I am willing to pay for a purely cinematic experience from time to time, and don't mind the hackneyed story. But two things did bother me in this experience. One is that shot of the helos rising from below the horizon. Please, it's just too tired, and led to a set of ending shots that must have been dictated from the financier's playbook. With such a promising beginning, to become so trite is a shame.

The other thing is a biggie. There is enough drama in the way war is really fought. The truth is much better than what we see here.

Carriers are monstrous machines. We didn't get that. We didn't get the sense of a whole city on board, nor life with planes constantly in the air, patrolling hundreds of miles out just as an umbrella, and the thousands of miles covered with collaboration through control and spy aircraft. We didn't get the sense of the whole battlegroup, 12-20 ships and subs with their own, various lethalities that could have been used. To reduce the whole thing to 3 (invincible) marine helos is pretty lame, and probably shows more pennypinching on the part of Hollywood than the Pentagon ever would have.

The chain of communication and command is far, far cooler than what you see here, as is intel. For instance, every cell phone conversation would have been monitored and reported to the field command even as far back as Bosnia/Kosovo, which it should be noted was the saving of Muslim skins.

Since so much of the world seems caught up in conspiracies involving the US military, I fully expect someone to claim that pictures like this are part of a disinformation campaign. Elsewise, no one could get things so wrong in such a way that it makes the film less entertaining. This must be the chaff, thrown off to divert attention.

I watched this in an audience of Navy pilots back from Afganistan. A real experience, I tell you.

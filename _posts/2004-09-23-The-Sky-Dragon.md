Spoilers herein.

Yes, this stuff is racist, and poorly produced to boot. But originally, the idea was to annotate the game of detection - that strategic movement between writer and reader - with Chinese sayings. Those were really pretty apt, both so far as the mystery and the denoting of wisdom. 

In the hands of a good writer, it was innovative and useful. In the hands of a hack, its Saturday morning skit quality.

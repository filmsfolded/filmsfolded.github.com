This actually has a pretty good idea behind it, as do many teen-oriented movies. The story structure here is that the serial murderer in question is striving to become a hunter of serial murderers. Clarissa is Hannibal. And the deaths are specifically to advance her career in this endeavor, sort of "To Die For" but with watchful, ironic fold.

Oddly, the approach they decided to take was no scares, no sex (and by this I mean the teen version which is no nudity), no blood. So its no wonder that the teen audience has turned its back, despite the girl being -- it seems -- a TeeVee starlet. But the idea is sound, and the top professor of serial killer hunters is played by William Shatner, no less.

The style and music is jaunty. It could have been 40 minutes, had way more edge. If it had, it would have fit nicely in what I watched it with: "Three Extremes."

There's actually an artful scene, just one, where our murderess throws a bottle at a fridge in a running stream. Fruit Chan could have built the whole movie from that.

Spoilers herein.

I yearn for cinematic adventure, so often duck down unfamiliar, sometimes dangerous alleys. I found 'Akira' and 'Mononoke' to be exhilaratingly challenging. Oddly cinematic. So, with scant knowledge I picked up this anime.

The story is simple enough: Faux Shinto warriors in the forms of 14 year old girl scouts live dual lives as silly useless (pre-) teenagers and as superheros who fight evil with the aid of magical gems and wands. It features strong pop music and minimalist animation. At first viewing, didn't impress me at all.

Then I checked it out in the literature.

Seems this is quite a phenomenon in a few target communities. Preteen girls, as one would suspect. But a much stronger following among males, those who presumably lust after preteen girls. And the characters do what they need to to accommodate this crowd: The girls in their scout/senshi forms have impossibly short skirts which often are the only element animated, never revealing a flash of panty. Most of the plots have a boy-girl (or here girl-girl) 'love' element, the villains are older (here topless) women. The gems are vaginal in a Georgia O'Keefe fashion and the wands phallic.

Turns out that there is a HUGE web presence of Sailor and similar amine porn, focusing on the Japanese obsessions of menarche, school uniform panties, and the myth of innocent lust.

Films define life to a large extent, especially where sex is concerned. Here we have the effect when it has the strongest impact. The series was around long enough to evolve to propagate the meme in the most effective manner. This is real movie power. This is really worth seeing.

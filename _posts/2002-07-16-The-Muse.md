Spoilers herein.

This is a wonderful idea for a film about film. It deserves to right up there with 'The Player,' 'I'll Do Anything,' even 'Sunset Blvd.' It is cleverly written, containing the mirror of 'cookies,' and the notion of divinity. Albert Brooks is not a deep thinker, but he is a talented stylist and storyteller and he's all over this cool self-reference.

What's wrong? Sharon Stone, that's what. To pull this off, you need someone who goes beyond sex -- even film sex -- to an allure and charm so powerful a mere whiff is hypnotizing. Unfortunately, the whole enterprise revolves around this notion. Unfortunately, Sharon can't even take the first steps on this voyage.

What a scandal. What a missed opportunity.

Ted's rating: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

Its a noir value -- the sort of things that characters would do in a noir movie -- to be very particular about what it means to be noir. So allow me this deviation from the conventional wisdom. This ain't noir.

For some people. Noir is merely dark and "off," either in the photography or the story -- or both. For me, noir is a wholly new, cinematic notion of the world, something invented by cinema, American cinema. Its the notion that there is a world where some sort of designer manipulates things against the interests of the on-screen characters and for our benefit. More: the implication is that story twists and particularly the supernatural coincidences are indeed supernatural: that our own desires as viewers drive the cosmology of the movieworld. 

Its a very strange feeling, that the very act of watching creates the story, and that the directions of the story reveal something about how our minds are put together. Watching what happens surprises us in revealing what we desire to make happen. Most films made today acknowledge and play with this dynamic in some way, even humor.

In contrast is the "old-school" style of drama, where the dynamics happen in front of us, and the reasons for the dynamics are explained and revealed to be completely in the world we see. So in an old-style "Hamlet," the tragedy is motivated by the nature of the actors as revealed; in a noir "Hamlet," there are supernatural forces driven by the ghost as our avatar, and the center of the thing is wonder about how the world works in terms of drama and dreams. 

Why isn't this noir? Because the characters all bring disaster because of obvious character flaws. Old style. See?

I haven't seen the deNiro/Lange version, but I suppose it to be much of the same, deNiro doing his intensity thing instead of the energetic life-hopping thing Widmark does.

I'm going to recommend against this. Its only engaging if you like car wrecks for the disaster alone. Or if effective acting by itself is enough to satisfy.

Western viewers will find this dull. I did. I am supposing that there are enough colloquial hooks to make it engaging for its target audience. It certainly seems to be narrowly focused on Chinese Singaporeans. 

If you do not know this, it is three short films by the same fellow, a local humorist. The "where got ghost?" theme is distributed in three places: Roadside, Forest and Home. Each is played for comedy.

You might like this, as I did, as an exercise in going further to enter the film's world than the filmmaker provided for. He very clearly assumed that you would of course resonate to the cultural jokes. It is assumed that you will naturally understand the local superstitions of this one (of four) culture in this tiny nation. They are quite unreachable, which makes them all the more alluring. They all have to do with manipulated fate.

It is easy to go even deeper though and try to get behind the specific structure of the thing. This is not composed structure we are talking about here, at least I think not. But it is there. All three set up the world so that there is no such thing as luck. There are three places to stand: in the movie itself as hapless nitwits. As the viewer, a position clearly reified. And in the position of the ghosts, who here are all-powerful but still conforming to a (rather illogical) code. 

The people in the story aren't quite people: There is much made of the 4D lottery, and you get the feeling that these people are no more than lottery numbers. The structure comes from how the power of the viewer as a sort of ghost is woven into and sort of competes with the powers of the on-screen ghosts. In the last segment, we even see the ghost on TeeVee! In the middle segment, there is a sort of middle existence, where characters transition from humans to half-ghosts. It is strange, unfamiliar, and a bit titillating.

There are two effective cinematic moments, at the end of the two earlier segments. The spell in the first segment it triggered by the theft of some oranges. As our dummy lays dying in the road, we see hundreds of oranges roll toward him as we have an overhead shot.

The second effect is the result of an elaborate setup, involving trees, a house, magic that is real magic pretending to be fake, and a sudden transition. It is really quite breathtaking visually and forms the spine of the viewer-ghost structure.

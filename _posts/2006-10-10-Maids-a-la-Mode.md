Another sweet spot movie.

If you rattle around old movies, you'll certainly spend some time in the early 30s because the experiments from that era are so fresh and novel. And you'll want to be in that area before the code clamped down on how women are allowed in movies.

So you probably will wander over to these sexual comedies where women worked in territory usually reserved for men. And of course what you see is pratfalls and embarrassment. But because these are women its often sexual humor. Here its about being undressed in public. 

I'm a fan of sorts of Zasu Pitts, an Olive Oyl type. because this is thin comedy, its not something to ask you to seek out to watch. Its short and silly, not much funnier than your typical "Our Gang" episode. But if you are in the neighborhood and can have a gander at this, its pretty interesting how sexual embarrassment is handled.

Our two women are dress models, which gives us a chance early in the thing to see women in underwear and night things. There are a few comic encounters with mechanical and manufactured things. But the real setup is for our girls at a posh party in purloined dresses. Zasu first has her underwear removed by a drunk pulling on a thread until it is all pulled out. Then she has the back of her dress ripped off. And finally her comrade accidentally sews drapery onto her back in an attempt to repair. So there can be a mix of ordinary pratfall and sexual embarrassment.

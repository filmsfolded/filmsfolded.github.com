I'm dutifully plowing through all film versions of Christie's work. That's because I believe that her work profoundly affected some key notions of narrative in film, The puzzlement is that there are no (or possibly few) films based on her stories that actually exploit her tricks.

This one is a particular touchstone because it features show-biz people and their inner circle. All are in a typical isolated location where everyone has a motive but no one an opportunity. Christie's trademark is to bend the narrative in unfamiliar ways. Always some assumption of a narrator is exploited, here the narrative of discovering the body.

That element is preserved from the book, together with most other original components of the story, but some things are oddly re-arranged (like the thrown bottle) for no apparent reason.

But the key change from the book is in the game. The books have a continuous contest between writer and reader starting from the beginning -- or nearly so. The movie adaptations, virtually all of them, take a different tack, one which exploits characters and place rather than the situation and compromised narrative.

So one is left with the question of whether the characters satisfy, as the story is only an excuse for us to see them. Generally, these characters do not. This Poirot tries too hard to be comical; there's a humorous "swimming" scene for instance. It scores a chuckle or two at the cost of completely destroying the officious Belgian of the books. He's supposed to be our guide, and that would never occur to us with this version at all.

Maggie was wasted here. See her in "Murder by Death" instead.

Various other actors, good ones, march through this, each doing their assigned theatrical bit. Of them, only Jane Birkin is at all interesting -- that is, if you know her non-film background and prior film work. She made a good career out of strongly playing vulnerable girl-women with hidden deep intent, and that's what her character does here.

Hurlyburly meets Dick meets Stone's Doors

I thought Brazil was sophomoric; 12 Monkeys thinly profound. But here, Gilliam has found his subject. The book was much better because it represented the real connection -- a man living on another planet superimposed on mine sends me a telegram because he's been able to hold onto words. Actually, he's used the weaving of words to continually reconstruct his mind as it unravels.

In the book, these words bridge the gap between dimensions, proving that words themselves are beyond beyond. Now we take a step back in creating this series of film images. We don't have many of the actual words here, so the expression comes not from the disembodied traveler, but from a film journalist and his skilled avatars. Makes it an entirely different thing -- the humor is directed against the situation, not found intrinsically in it. The narrator and his muse are objects of the vision rather than originators of it.

The book was the real report from the sixties. Then, we did it. Now, we consume translations and reflections (that incidentally must be amusing, just read the comments here). But if you take this film at that level, as a Python skit of the time, it is terrific. Depp is quirky, but he has balls and this time it clicks. He's intelligent, and knows how to play an actor, playing a character playing a role, with each level thinking he's connecting with the cosmic audience, which for Depp we faithfully provide -- damn our voyeurism. Depp is similarly intelligent in Ninth Gate.

Del Toro gets left out because he only knows how to play things straight. Works in Way of the Gun, but not here. No wonder he is unhappy with it.

Gilliam still doesn't know how to live with a camera, so the eye here is never from a master. But he does know how to build startling images from props and sets. (The circus was masterful: how about that trapeze birth scene!)

Contrast this with Requiem for a Dream, which has a good eye, but little understanding of the visual mind. And Hurlyburly, which masters the mind part of this world, but might have been better as a radio play.

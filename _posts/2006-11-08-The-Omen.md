Why is this so bad and the original considered quite good?

I think the major reason is that the original was made in a gentler cinematic age, when a child with an evil look could spook you. And the dad being Scout's father too. It could work. There was absolutely no humor in it either.

This one has a few elements that tell you right away that it doesn't take itself seriously. The two most egregious are the casting of Rosemary as the nanny, and there's a few Rube Goldberg "Final Destination" inspired grisly deaths as if the devil's job were to entertain us.

But for me, this carries no fright because its obvious that the filmmakers don't believe in the devil. Done the road from me is Pat Robertson's film school, a billion dollar affair, tuned to making Christian filmmakers. They don't yet make competent films, but they will some day. Even the incompetent films from true believers can be startling sometimes. That's because when you see a movie from them where there is a battle with the devil, you know they believe the film itself to be part of the same battle.

You have none of that feel here.

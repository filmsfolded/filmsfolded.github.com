I was pretty impressed by "z-Boys." It was about the improvisation of a ragged, comparatively radical style. All about the style, and the film itself was in that same exuberant style.

As I write this, the "Hollywood" version is out, reportedly a disaster with none of the risktaking style of the original skaters.

So instead of shelling out $40 for that, I sought out this.

This must be a third or fourth generation of skaters, because it is way, way different. The purpose of this film is apparently to showcase some skater-related songs. The songs are laconic, moving fluidly but with a dispassionate dullness. That's the affect of skaters today: cool to the point of dull. Stuff shouldn't look radical, instead reflect the obvious mastery of a distinct world.

This gets points because it is genuinely homemade, but I miss the raw energy and risktaking of the earlier skaters.

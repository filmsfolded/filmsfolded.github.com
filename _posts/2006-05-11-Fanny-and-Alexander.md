This may be the most competent film ever made. It truly is magnificent in how effective it is in satisfying its intent. It has glory and pain, close to perfect in most respects, all the ones that matter theatrically.

It is ambiguous in its gloom, which removes it from the relentlessly depressing stuff that preceded it. It is richly constructed, with lots of folded levels with: plays about plays in several different ways.

So why do I not rate it a "must view?" My glib answer, one I actually gave once, is that 1982 was a very good year for film and I only allow myself two from each year at the supreme level. Technically, those two I selected aren't as gloriously balanced in the dimensions this is.

But they instead take us somewhere that is useful, that challenges. This is a ride to the moon in a comfortable tour bus. Those other two visit less sophisticated theatrical landscapes, but they do it on foot, engaged in the hot, sweaty and dangerous transport of ourselves.

So I will tell you it is sublime in many ways and not very useful to building a real life in film.

Bergman himself is in three characters here: the boy (as widely known), the magical Jew who makes the illusions that we believe to be real as the film, and the stern stepfather. There's too much of this last, too much of the bitterness he forces us to swallow by surrounding it with sweetness.

So instead this comment is on the Jew's perspective, the kabbalistic folding of the thing.

The Jew is a master puppeteer in two young guises, Aron and (female) Ismael who we learn have created all that proceeds or follows, perhaps. That is roughly framed as Hamlet's play within the play, during a rehearsal for which we witness the father play the ghost, then become the ghost. Later, he is replaced by the stepfather through a similar channel.

(Remember Hamlet's qualms about killing his stepfather without allowing him to confess his sins.) 

The thing begins with young Hamlet (Alex) as the stagemaster, and at night the filmmaker, showing slides and illustrating the ghost story. Then life at grandma's house as theater. In fact, at all three houses as theater.

If it were just the Jew Isak behind the illusions, weaving the structure, we'd have something with emotional kinematics. But that guy with the spiritual pharmaceuticals gets in the way. Darn.

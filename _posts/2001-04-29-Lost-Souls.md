Spoilers herein.

Here is a man who has mastered his camera, and had to bend to the prosaic, simple visions of Spielberg and other cinematic bozos. Putting him in charge means you get really, really creepy images, really powerful stuff, close to the bone. The down side: he doesn't know much about acting, and narrative pacing. Kaminski is clearly influenced by Polanski, even to the knife, the images from the walls ('Repulsion'), the clear references to 'Rosemary.' Even the Devil is Polish: the Polish devil is unique, much more malevolent and visually-based than any other.

Horror is perhaps the most cinematic of the genres, unless you are goofing or grossing. Horror tales never depended so much on story beyond giving some shape, some excuse for the images. So investing too much in story is a mistake I think. Script aside, I believe this is one of the most powerfully shot pure horror films ever. (For the most intelligent, you might check out 'Ninth Gate.' For more viscerally visual, see some Greenaway if you have the guts.)

Here, we have an actress who is still Depp's soulmate in the sense of being adventuresome and deliberately traveling beyond her reach. Like him, she is also generous, willing to not be the see-me, see-me focus, and to submit her presence to the effect. She worked with Kaminski on 'American Quilt' and one would assume some special recognition of talent occurred there.

Here we have an actor in Hurt, who frightens just with his commitment. Often this detracts from his performance because Jesus, he just intimidates. But he is just right here as the Devil's primary adversary then agent.

Here we have perky Meg Ryan who is becoming a (possibly intelligent?) force in production. Winona has been as well, but here it is Meg's Prufrock pictures that takes the risk of being visually oriented. Problem is, they panicked at the previews and dumbed things down. This would have been better (but still flawed in pacing) if they had kept their meek mutts off.

This visual meditation requires a self-aware eye and is not for people with attention deficit disorder.

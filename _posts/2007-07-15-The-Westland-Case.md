This may be hard for you to find. Mine is the first comment, so I will describe the story a bit.

It is fairly typical in many respects. You've got a wisecrackin, drinkin, womanizin detective and his sidekick. There are backstabbin partners and cheatin wimmen. There's a gathering of all the suspects for the announcement of the true murderer only seconds before the enframed is executed. Witnesses are killed as soon as they are identified.

And the basic form is a locked room mystery. The woman is killed in a locked room to which the only other key is the suspect's.

What makes this interesting is that it begins with a film within the film. Its a bit tortured, so its obvious that the writers went to some trouble to arrange it. The same group of suspects is gathered to see this movie. It is a "re-enactment" of the discovery of the body, made by the prosecutor and involving all the original characters -- and the body. It must have been made moments after the real events.

I don't know of any other detective movie with this device. There is lots of joking about watching a movie and not making one, when this is happening.

So even though the mystery is ordinary, this narrative device makes the movie important.

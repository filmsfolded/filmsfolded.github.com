Spoilers herein.

I know of few instances where a film is vastly superior to book on which it is based. The  book was clumsily written around a clever idea. The film is anything but clumsy. Well,  except for one thing and that was deliberate.

The book was jarring in its anachronistic language and perspective. It seemed almost like  a visit to a zoo where you impose your own senses on the animals. Peter Greenaway has  this precise notion in mind when making his Vermeer film, 'Zed and Two Noughts,' also  filmed in Huguenot territory.

It is preserved in this film in the way we are meant to see her cool acceptance of the  situation. Never mind, the story is disposable and is only there to allow us something to  photograph.

But that dissonance of anachronistic vision is apt. Vermeer and other Lowlands painters  of the era were revealing humanity with light, were 'looking into' people by displaying  not them but the effect they have on the light. The light both sees and commingles with  the person's being, just as our sight of this maid helps determine her character. The  notion was actually well ahead of its time. Vermeer was poorly appreciated in his time  and we have only 26 paintings.

I am a harsh critic of films about art that are themselves contradictory in presentation to  their subject. Not so here. The matter of this enterprise is to give us that romantic,  probing light in its compositions, the interior ones anyway. It is worth watching for that  alone. Weaknesses are Firth (who is not sufficiently strong to play weakness) and the  obligatory streetshots that show the 'history' of the time and place.

Vermeer is all about hair, skin and cloth and what light can discover. This particular  painting is notable because it lacks the hair and replaces it with the gaze back at us. It  was indeed considered obscene. The film does a wonderful job with hair, precisely to  make the subliminal point. (Again, Firth's hair is the exception.)

Griet's hair is lit to show red the one time we see it, though we have previously been told  it was brown. And that was during an exchange which underscored the private nature of  the sight of that hair. When briefly released, that 'inner' organ entered the light as if it  were the air we breath. Catherina's hair (ostensibly blond) and Cornelia's (probably  brown) are also changed by the light into shades of red, reaching out to us.

The choice of Scarlett had little to do with beauty (the camera can make nearly anyone  beautiful), but instead had to do with those blurred lips. Look at the real painting and you  will see a nearly impressionistic mouth, two centuries before it became rote. The red lips  are blurred in a way that the mouth conveys many simultaneous meanings. Scarlett  cannot quite do that as Kate and Cate and Julianne could, but her anatomy suggests it,  especially when she 'wets her lips.'

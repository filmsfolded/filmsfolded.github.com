Spoilers herein.

Building a life in films is sometimes a matter of digging into one's self using tools provided by clever artists. But sometimes not. Sometimes it is a matter of sorting out the bombardment of images, worlds and relationships that entice. These come from decorative imaginations, and no one is a better example than Fellini.

He is not an intelligent man: he doesn't have a cosmology he is visually unfolding like say Tarkovsky or Greenaway. He is instead a costume designer with a particularly acute sense of staging and a deep connection to his own emotions. That can still be worth watching, worth incorporating into your own life. '8 1/2' is his best because he was able to overcome an attention deficit disorder and create something sublimely coherent. The storytelling is fluid -- so amazingly so you actually notice it -- while it rambles through realities. That fluidity and coherence is missing here.

Where '8 1/2' was centered in his own eye, here he takes its harem scene and blows it into its own film, but from his wife's eye. Unfortunately, one of the primary messages from this spirit world is that he doesn't understand it at all. He still tries to make sensuality his anchor, and misses what he knows and says with the other side of his brain: feminine sense is different.

Oh well. Bits and pieces of this are so imaginative and original that they are worth keeping and weaving into our imagination but using someone else's world.

Woody Allen's remake of this ('Alice'), while less visually meaty is much better in all other cinematic dimensions.

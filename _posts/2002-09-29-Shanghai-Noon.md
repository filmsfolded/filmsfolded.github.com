Spoilers herein.

Martial arts movies have a hard time in the US. There is a small core audience that likes to see fighting of any type, and a still smaller group interested in the ballet. So to make the numbers, producers wrap them in something else: racial commentary, cop buddy movies, the thriller, comedy. Jackie Chan was always a comedian, but in China, his comedy was in the actual fights. That won't work here, so he has been forced to search for a comedy form. And boy he's tried a lot of them and failed.

I think this is his most successful. That's because of Owen Wilson. Owen is not the type of old fashioned actor who tries to adapt to each role. He's the John Wayne, Harrison Ford type who markets a personae that people can exploit if they wish. When Bruce Willis does this, his commodity is a smirk; he is winking at the audience in a layered conspiracy as if to say: 'I'm acting this stupid role, so chuckle along with me at how stupid it is.' He didn't pioneer this attitude, but inherited it from Cary Grant, who adapted it from some of Clark Gable's winks. Willis has spawned a bunch of copies, some of whom Chan has tried on.

Now along comes Owen Wilson. What Owen sells is a whole next generation of audience-winking. With him, the attitude is 'You and I know this role is bogus, so lets trash it.' Its the attitude we all know from some guy in school who made trouble by going along. TeeVee opened a niche for this attitude in acting, and now Wilson is making a career of it. Stiller does this too, and that's why 'Zoolander' was such a gas; it exploited just this sort of posing.

I'm amazed at how many places Wilson has made this work. His ironic comedy of course. But 'Minus Man' was made more chilling with him doing his thing, trashing his own locker. Garofalo is the queen to his king of selfdeprecation, and made 'Minus' work. 

Now consider this film. What works is the completely goofy space Wilson creates. As an example, that speech to himself at the showdown with the sheriff: 'I'm going to die! No, be the bullet, be the wind, you can do this. No, I'm going to die!' Interspersed with Chan crushing the posse with a horseshoe. Its rather clever engineering of mood, and the creative force behind this film needs to be congratulated. This is Wilson's best comedy, I think, because we aren't asked to laugh at him. He sets the tone for Chan to step into so we can laugh at him. Its more comfortable and less risky than laughing at ourselves.

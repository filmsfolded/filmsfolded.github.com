Spoilers herein.

Woody makes films about films and how they create life. Each project adopts a different set of ideas he finds, so the whole body of work is a sort of encyclopedia of notions about self-reference and folding. In a way, what films you like are determined by what set of ideas you use in your own home world of film. 

This one is often compared to 'Sherlock Jr,' where a projectionist enters the world of film. There is a framing element of that notion here, with Mia's fantasies. The fantasy we see is the other way around, which is more clever: the world of fiction entering the 'real' world.

It's an amazing idea, until here always found in science fiction in the form of 'virtual' or artificial beings seeking a more human existence. Mapping it to film is an imaginative leap. It is as if the viewer creates something that in turn creates the viewer.

Everyone lives in their own movie, and for most of us that movie controls us.

Inside that film world, Woody comes up with some clever ideas: each screen has its own world, parallel with the other instances of that film. The characters are aware of repeating each instance; some would rather be doing something else. Without a script, they are lost.

At this point, Woody was changing girlfriends, and switching therapists from Freudian to Jungian. It shows.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 3 Â– worth watching

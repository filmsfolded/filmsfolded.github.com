I suppose you could see this on three layers. The first layer is what you talk yourself into: a romance between two people who have been passed over. You could place it in London, as we are meant to, in the "new" UK. It is earnest and dear. 

Under that, you get what most people actually pay for: two actors who have mastered the body language of denial, placed into well-written characters. The trick here is that these characters have to hint that they have great power under their incompetent persons. That is to be handled by two actors who usually overinhabit their characters, so even ordinary lines work well enough.

But under that... we have the layer that fascinates me. This is in effect a movie about an old guy who made himself lost -- losing his wife, child and ability to live -- by not believing in his talent. If you have not seen this, he is (we presume) a natural jazz piano talent who has compromised himself down to the lowest level we can imagine in movie-land: commercial jingles. The story has him finding his jazz by being cast adrift. The amazing inner fold is that the movie itself is highly musical. It has a bigger background score, more intrusive than usual even for a romance.

That music is trivial, tinkly. It is trite, artificially bright. It demeans the whole enterprise by presenting an escape from mediocre patterns by expressing itself in mediocre patterns. So while our hero escapes (we suppose), the movie does not. And so we do not.

The most interesting actor here is the buddy of Emma's character, played by Bronagh Gallagher. She does to the Irish face, what the silly music does to our world. But she has fun with it, and we don't.

Spoilers herein.

I watched this because it had such strong recommendations from IMDB, and because I'm interested in whether Sarah Polley may emerge as an actress worth following. Also anything that Cronenberg endorses piques my curiosity.

But I found this dreadful, at the level of actor's workshop at the community theater. A couple situations had promise: the mother's grasping at fantasy in the beginning -- the 'make me love you so you can kill me' reasoning at the end. But it was inexpertly handled in all respects: no element was notable, not the staging, writing, acting photography, sound design -- nothing. These elements are less important if the project has soul, but there is no energy here.

For enthusiasts of independent film, I invite you to compare this with John Sayle's 'Limbo,' which explores the same territory: relationships and family-sex driven ritual under the threat of a great unknown, stressed by the environment, all developing toward an 'end' ending. See how Sayles masters the various elements of the craft with an understanding of how to shape the effect. See how no movement seems contrived and as a result we are sucked into the emotional space. See how tone and style are controlled through the dance of the eye and the light. See how the actors understand the film's intent and live within it.

And then watch for any inkling of that here; it just does not exist. The Canadian independent community has riches: Cronenberg is a talented production designer and his 'eXistenZ' was surprisingly multidimensional. Egoyan understands time folding in narrative at a world class level, possibly even beyond. Is the community so small and inbred that even the slightest talent is supported? Perhaps people just cannot afford to make enemies.

I found two of McKeller's prior projects equally dreary and mechanical. '32 Short Films' had the burden of focusing on a soulless, mechanical performer and amplified that weakness. 'Red Violin' missed every of the many opportunities presented to create something as powerful as the violin.

I cannot recommend this. See 'Limbo' instead.

You need to see this and "Funny Face" together and perhaps another Astair musical from this era with a woman who was a more appealing dancer, like Cyd Charisse. All of these feature French romance. 

"Funny Face" is about the photographed woman with the dance just part of the elaborate pose. "Silk Stocking" was centered on the allure of Paris charming romance out of a flattened woman. They're good material for a musical, because the music can be used to convey the charm. And isn't that the point?

This is about a wonderful French girl who is wonderful before the thing begins. She is spied by a character intended to stand in for us, a viewer, indeed a voyeur. Rich enough to be able to sustain her anonymously. 

Superficially the plot is smarmy. Based on one lascivious glance, our rich guy buys himself a girl about a third his age. The construction was obviously for him standing for us, to watch and woo. This also is natural stuff for a musical, but requires some real cleverness and energy compared to the other examples.

Caron is a real dancer. Not of Fred's type. His business is starting with ballroom and mixing in stage tap, or sometimes going the other way. Leslie is a ballerina. She has a ballerina's body, extraordinarily shaped by torturous training. She moves without the bursts that Fred used to be able to do, and that he does with drumsticks in the first parts (and also in Easter Parade if I remember right).

So its a mad mix, an old guy who once was explosive but cannot now be and someone who is graceful and appealing but passionless. The central bits in this have Caron dancing basically alone, sometimes with Astair's character watching. These are abstract scenes, clearly derived from "Red Shoes."

There's a cool little fold in one scene. The movie is in cinemascope, a very wide screen. Our rich guy is reviewing marketing slides from an airline he owns. They are projected onto a screen in his office with the same proportion. Okay, we immediately say, that screen will soon show a movie within the movie, and so it does within minutes: his imaginings of her imaginings of him.

Pretty good bits, too.

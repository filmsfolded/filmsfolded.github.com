These were produced in bulk. Hal Roach's Filmography must be the largest of anyone. But even in these, where the thinnest of ideas was overblown to fill the time, you can see some ordinary folding.

The business with the gang was all about mugging. And Spanky was the star, at least in the early ones because he was the best at facial expressions.

So here's the setup: we see a recording of someone trying to record Spanky. The success of the recording we see depends on the failure of the photographer.

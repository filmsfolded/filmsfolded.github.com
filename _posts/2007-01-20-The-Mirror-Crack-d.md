Commenting on film is in the long run a matter of advising on who you can trust and who you might want to avoid.

I can tell you that one person who to avoid is the adapter of this, Bowen. He's been involved in other Christie adaptions and is so brutal in how he handles the core mechanics of what Christie created, he's so evil in his intent he murders the thing.

So either you can avoid this, supposing what you want is a good mystery after the fashion that Christie created so wonderfully...

or you can watch it and try to deduce why Bowen murdered it so, what there was about his intent that made this happen. The mystery at this level is quite fascinating, especially if you look at the other Christie screenplays he's done. Its a metadetective narrative: why did he do it? What's the motive?

It puzzles me that anyone would rely on the term "surrealism." I suppose that one could say that everything that is not "real" is surreal, but what is the value in this? Annoyingly, newspaper critics toss the Quay Brothers, Bunuel, Jodorowsky, even early Cronenberg in the same bucket as Lynch and call that that.

All art is surreal. If an artist is worth your investment, it is because she has something unique to offer. 

I'm not all that crazy about Bunuel, but his gift was how he could seamlessly merge the sense of things we know with those we lose control over. The Quays astound me with worlds invested in object views. Jodorowsky's stitching into the familiar is via worthy comment on theatrical tropes.

Lynch is different, wholly different. A whole different experience.

There are a number of ways to get from the world each viewer believes is real to the world of the film. That world by itself is less valuable than the connections that are maintained between the two worlds by the process of pulling them apart. These are what the artist can pull in changing your soul.

Cronenberg for example does this by adding to certain elements of the ordinary and blowing them into crystalline forces. Many artists do this in a general sense. Cronenberg selects the most uncomfortable obsessive seeds to grow from. Madden from worried elements of memory.

Why Lynch is so vitally important to your viewing journey is that he abstracts into his worlds by taking away rather than adding or expanding. I imagine his legendary bible verse, the one he says that "explains" this is a verse in the New Testament clearly not there and taken away, erased. Though Lynch is hardly a good authority on himself, this matters.

This whole thing's value -- and his much more mature "Inland Empire" -- is about what he takes away. Lynch did not start as a filmmaker. Like Greenaway, he started as a painter. Painters understand this notion of showing by removing. He made extended studies of dessication with animal remains for years before entering the AFI program. One of them is here, the decayed hollow of some pet animal that Henry plays with via an attached wire and his shoe. 

Memories are made of what is omitted. The gift of birth is as much about the unmakings and undone as anything.

Some of what Lynch does here fails I think because in spite of it all he could not escape some desire for overt obviousnessess. The business about the sperm- embryo- brainstem props is simply juvenile and gives stoners something to chortle about. He abandoned that stuff later. Really, "Empire" is where you need to be, with its erasures structured according to a polish tradition -- which just happens to coincide with that missing bible passage.

Lynch's God here should be taught in school, next to Joseph Smith's gently healthy patriarch.

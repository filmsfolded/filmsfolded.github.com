If you really follow these things, you can find some quite interesting elements.

One constant is that since film and books use different narrative conventions, there must be an adaptation from one to the other. That's less true with modern books because they are usually written cinematically. (Also, books today are incidentally more episodic, but that's because of how TeeVee has reset our expectations of narrative cycle. But that doesn't apply here.)

You can trace several phases in the adaptation strategy in these Basil Rathbone projects and its even more interesting in the context of all Holmes movies (and those that copy those adaptations). Holmes is not a bad thing to work with in studying the pathways that adapters can follow, because it was such a profound shock to literature. It was important, not only in the way it shifted narrative, but because it introduced the notion of characters with scientific logic rather than simple need or passion.

So we have the original stories, in which Sherlock was a scientist, with all the foibles and characteristics of the stereotype of a scientist of the day. By the time Rathbone came along, this had transformed to a more theatrically centered persona. Brits place great weight on accent and elocution, and Holmes was defined first in the way he stated things and only secondly in what he did, which in the early films was rather mundane. We relied on Watson for amusement, a man now turned from narrator to comic.

Then alone came the war, with a threat against the existence of England, and Holmes was enlisted to fight. Many film characters were and all movie detectives on both sides of the Atlantic. In this mode, Holmes morphed into a more firm character, with all the logic being used in the context of this focused resolution. If nations believe that God (and therefore justice) is on their side, in this case we saw that logic and science was too. So instead of Holmes being a character on the fringe of society -- and valued because of it -- that shifted to him at the defining center of the national character.

Now, so far as England was concerned, the war was over and Holmes shifts again, reflecting the great relaxation. They were able to cease being parts of a staunch war machine and go back to whatever role hey played in society before the war. So its no surprise that Holmes is back fighting crime.

(It should be noted that these were always funded by US studios, but I believe I am correct that the production teams -- excepting parts of "Holmes in Washington" -- were British.)

But the genre had shifted in the meantime, so when Holmes shifts back, he is registered on new expectations. Agatha Christie had completely reinvented the form, with amazing experiments in hiding and shuffling the identity of the murderer. "Murder on the Orient Express" was part of the template. The traditional Holmes had never encountered such subtlety: his opponents, the real ones, were simple geniuses, single souls matching wits. These criminal minds were as much about the game as the ends: money.

You can see the influence of Christie in this story. Yes, we have the old Rathbone Holmes back. He's not Sherlock as written, but the Sherlock of the prewar "Hound." But the situation isn't anything Conan Doyle would have recognized or understood. This is a Christie world he has entered.

So you might find it interesting on that account. Otherwise, it is drek.

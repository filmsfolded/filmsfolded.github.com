This has been universally panned because it just isn't funny, or at least most folks think so.

So if you want to get some value of watching it, or even reading this comment, you'll want to think about why it isn't.

And to do that, you'll have to start with the cartoon. It started decades ago in the midst of an avalanche of cuteness, often symbolized by a cute kitten. The grand joke was that we would have a fat, selfish, obnoxious cat, more or less occupying the same space.

Thousands of comic strips later, the joke has changed little. It is deliberately juvenile (in both the humor and the world that contains it) and actually sometimes works. Meanwhile, some very savvy marketeers smelled a sweet spot for marketing furry stuffed animals. They were able to sell to youngsters who wanted anything soft with a recognizable brand, and their older sisters who saw or sensed the selfish irony in the thing.

The success of the marketing has extended the life of the comic strip, which is pretty tired now. But it is like McDonald's, unrewarding but predicable.

So if you had this property and wanted to make a movie, what do you do?

Well, the solution here is to abandon the comic strip Garfield. Keeping that would mean keeping the whole abstract world of the strip. This would require Tim Burton, I suppose.

Instead, they used the world of the stuffed animal. Real people and everything, and only the furry thing different. Then they applied the Disney 101 Dalmations formula.

So coming from the start, there was none of the Garfield humor that could have been brought over.

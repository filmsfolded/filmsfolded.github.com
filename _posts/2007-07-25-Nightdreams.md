Some porn from around the late seventies is worth it. "Deep Throat" had at least put money into the system and there were serious expectations that after the sensation wore down, we'd have explicit sex in "ordinary" film as we do in literature and, well, life. My own belief is that the pushback from religious zealots forced sex in films into its own compartment. The result is that harmful stereotypes have been reinforced and we are all worse off.

Anyway, there are a few films that you might find interesting from this suspended era. This isn't quite one. For a film to be a film in my book, it has to have some long form coherence, what folks usually call a story. But it is more than that; its a context, a way to situate the coupling in the world. Porn today is characterized by simple episodes. Context only matters so far as it supports the stereotype being exploited. So for instance if we are supposed to know the guy is a poolcleaner dude, or the woman a schoolgirl, we'll get enough to define that. But only that.

This film is something in between. The "story" has two whitecoated doctors behind a glass wall observing a woman having some sort of erotic hallucinations. The substance of the movie is these episodes of course. All are some sort of ravishing of our subject. The sex is conventional by today's standards but the situations are decidedly not in some cases. There are devils, cowgirls, odd demons, and (get this) Arabs.

The idea is to exploit all sorts of fringe fantasies. Its all pretty hohum, mostly because the cinematic power of what this could be is unexploited. And the actress is a dolt.

But there's one sequence that really is quite spectacular.

Its a well-groomed black man. Not a rough muscular buck, someone that looks like a young rail porter. He is inside a Cream of Wheat box and has sex with our fantasizer while a jazz saxophone player dances around the pair. 

Oh, and he's a piece of toast. Its pretty striking both in its cleverness and the completely unique spin on the racial stereotype of the black man, and the implied buckwheat, and cream jokes. Ah, those days, where sex, role and race could be played with in this way.

I think this is not much viewed today. It was never good art nor is it "good" porn by today's standards. But see it for that one scene.

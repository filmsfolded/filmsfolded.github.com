What's so interesting about these stupid little films are the assumptions they make. And that we easily accept.

Here's the setup. We are an audience watching a movie. Within that is a gaggle of people within their own play. Someone gets dressed in costume, not because of our drama but their's.

What's a bit interesting about this is that the chief designated audience (Moorland) is herself a mystery writer who as the story develops is writing it. That's three levels that are so acceptable, so natural that we usually never think about it.

Along the way, the mild twist is that the usual bad guy (Price), who we've been prepared to believe is the Bat, is not. Actually we see it coming because with several winks, the writers have told us this cannot be because he too obviously is indicated such. He kills early. He clearly is after the money. He keeps and is obsessed with bats...

You may be incidentally amused at how Agnes thinks this character is defined. Lacking a strong director, she just shows up every day and does what occurs to her, something different every day.

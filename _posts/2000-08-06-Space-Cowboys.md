This is an utterly forgettable movie, and the flaws are ordinary and uninteresting. But there are some interesting things about it.

Clint Eastwood is a rather highly regarded director: he is not someone who can get inside a script and create (and pare to) a unique vision. Rather, he is a no nonsense stick-to-the-schedule craftsman who focuses on performances. So he's very popular in the business, while keeping his distance.

Here we have four actors. None is a great actor, but each has mastered a particular approach. The problem in this case is: if we let these men do what they do, and each has a different, contrasting style, how we pull off an ensemble piece?

We do have radically differing styles here. Garner is a natural, comedic, with an emphasis on body movement. Eastwood is purely facial. His comedic strength is in his vocal stance when speaking, while Garners is in his timing. Both are 'external' actors, meaning they 'put on' their role. Jones attempts the most in his general approach, the standard 'method,' and is the least accomplished, while Sutherland has thoroughly mastered his simpler, but similar goal. Both are 'internal' actors. It must have been quite a set with Clint trying to get some shared vision of what to project and how.

All the ensemble scenes (other than walking) are cut and we have instead individuals and pairs. That works well enough for this film, though I think more Garner would have been funnier.

I have been in most all the places at Johnson Space Center where the film is set, and that took some of the fun out. That's because folks, NASA uses really OLD technology, partly because they are not the brightest kids on the block, partly because of they way they buy things and partly because older stuff is more reliable. And they have many, many old guys on board (mostly as double-triple dipping consultants). So the notion of an 'obsolete' guidance system is laughable. The shuttle's flight control system was essentially designed 35 years ago! But Clint doesn't know that I guess.

The nearly final shot is a panning shot of the moon which seamlessly zooms in a few thousand miles to 'normal' figure distance. This computer generated effect is best in class.

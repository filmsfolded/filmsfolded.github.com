Spoilers herein.

Film allows so many different modes, that we depend on the first few minutes of a movie to tell us what world we are entering and something of the rules of that world.

The first muppet movie was one of the most important of films because of the new dimension it added: highly self-referential annotation. It was about the making of itself. At one point there is a fight and Kermit gets tossed around into the piano. (The piano player is the film's composer.) Kermit looks directly at the camera and says ' I hope you appreciate that I am doing my own stunts!'

Jim Henson did not invent folded realities in film, but he surely was a key innovator. He took this notion pretty far with his ambitious experiments in 'Labyrinth' and 'Dark Crystal,' both failures in the end. The high point was the 'Muppet Movie' which was directed by a 'real' director. Since Jim's death and the entrance of Disney, all the creative steam is gone and we are left with simple exploitation. The kind of folding Henson had in mind can never be repeated, so this project starts off with a structural handicap.

Meanwhile, Charles Dickens. He invented much of what Modern Christmas is. (Santa Claus' appearance and importance would be invented later by Coke.) The magic of Dickens is that he is totally without irony in the story, or folding if you will. He creates characters and lets them bump up against each other on their own accord. The whole thing works because it is without folding.

Now these two world-creating paths (folding and antifolding) meet and do a good job of temporarily merging. It is this merged world to which we are introduced in the first few minutes. The clever idea here is that a muppet portrays the writer, the creator of what we see. Gonzo is a fabricated actor who acts the writer of the story. He both creates the characters and intermingles with them as a created character himself. As a clever idea, is is a rehash of older muppetry, but it works at least so far as making a watchable film.

As it develops, in addition to the muppet narrator, it folds several other layers: familiar muppets acting parts, humans acting parts (Scrooge and girlfriend, Nephew and wife), newly created puppets who are not muppets acting some parts (the ghosts). The oddness of Dickens characters as created by him smoothly meshes with the similar oddness of Henson's exaggerated characters. That alone makes this the second most successful project in the muppet world. 'Treasure Island' for instance, tried a similar trick and failed because Stevenson built his characters a different way.

There are three or four muppet jokes inserted that do not derive from the story. But because we have a real narrator, we can get more of the actual language of Dickens' written word. And oddly, that makes this one of the most successful 'Carol's on film in spite of Caine's excesses.

The songs are dreadful except for the appearance of Marley (here as brothers).

Bottom line: it is neither good Dickens nor good Henson. But no stage or film drama is good Dickens anyway, so if all you want is a sentimental echo of the real thing, this will do better than most.

The substance of this is the same old stuff. Tired, unreachably stupid. Juvenile. 

But its been engineered with a few folding tricks to make it palatable. Folding is a collection of narrative devices that place the viewer in the story, thereby engaging us more deeply. 

Its clear that the authors of this are just dummies who brought to an advanced script lab and they fixed it so that it would make money.

Look at two devices here. The first is that they story we pay to see is told as a story by Tom Green to a bunch of hapless innocents. They become entranced as we are supposed to. During the telling his own notions distort the story. There's a particular scene early in the thing where this is burned into us. He describes a simple conversation among some girls. But in his version, they are nude and topless, and it becomes in the folded "reality."

The other device is that while we watch a video, the plot revolves around attempts to keep someone from watching a video. She's a pretty redhead, as any solid narrative engineer would have it. Everyone else isn't.

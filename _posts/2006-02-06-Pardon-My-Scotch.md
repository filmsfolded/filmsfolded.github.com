So many of the Stooge projects run into each other. After all, formula and consistency is part of the game.

That's why comments on then simply will identify something unique to that one: in this case, the injury from a stunt. These guys must have been completely used up physically by the time they left us.

Here's the one thing I'll ask you to look for. In the midst of other hilarity, the guys sit down to a ritzy meal in their kilts. Curly does the roll-dance. That's where you stick forks into two dinner rolls and do a dance with them. This was invented by Chaplin in "Goold Rush." It was huge hit in its day, but I've found it to be a sort of tune that future comics can interpret in their own way. Johnny Depp and Robert Downey did amazing commentary variations on this.

And Curly does here. It is only a couple seconds.

Curly was the Stooge most like his real personality. Most of what you see in the shorts in him is stuff he just naturally did without planning or rehearsal. This little dance is clumsy and inept in precisely the way he was. This is followed by a bit where the rolls (actually a substituted larger one) move from becoming feet to a mouth, so when Curly tries to bit a sandwich, it bites him first.

Spoilers herein.

I corresponded with PKD during his flowering period. He was an amazingly reflective mind: someone like Nash (with whom he was also communicating) who could deeply engineer his alternative existences. He had completely and utterly merged this arbitrary parallelism with the ambiguities of the word: the reader and writer, the writer and character, the creator and character, the character as creator, the word and meaning in all this.

That is his genius, something he explored with other writers, but few scifi ones, and with an appalling, exhilarating fearlessness and personal investment. We do have some clever films that have resulted and a strangely stupid fan base. Some of those fans, parasites and acquaintances conspired to create this documentary.

As you no doubt know, this is poor, even annoying, in terms of production values. That would be tolerable if anything interesting were conveyed. But though some of these people knew him, they are all completely uninteresting and apparently never tuned into the man's juice.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

Spoilers herein.

As bad as the one the preceded it. Worse, even. There is no detection here, only a protection  scheme, the ever bumbling Watson, a pretty girl (actually pretty this time), an invented  nemesis, some fights and the old switcheroo. None of this bears any resemblance to what  made the original stories the most popular and influential of its generation.

Spoilers herein.

I can't believe I watched this a second time. I did so because I am interested in the  mechanics of narrative folds, usually called 'plot twists.' This has one which is worthy of  Agatha Christie in its boldness. 

Christie and her peers invented this notion or establishing a truth and later demolishing  it - in the process revealing hidden motives and reinventing all the story you have just  seen.

But this is a tricky business. It fails if the story seems too contrived, unreal. It fails if the  mechanics of the reinvented story don't quite make sense compared to the established  story. It fails if the actors aren't sufficiently talented or guided to make the shift.

This film has all of these flaws, quite apart from Petersen' s other deficiencies.

One of the extra problems with this film is the casual way it uses film stereotypes to  carry the story. I am particularly sensitive to overuse of the 'architect' as a character  stereotype. In this case, the architect is both the designer and developer, with massive  skills related to making things happen in space.

This exaggeration is allowable in my mind when the film concerns itself with space and  mastery of space. Despite the fact that Petersen made his career in just such  explorations ('das Boot') there is nothing here other than repeated soaring through  space in car wrecks.

Whalley-Kilmer is a puzzle to me. She has only one groove and that is her facial posing  in what amounts to Victorian soap ads. Helena Bonham-Carter consistently delivers on  these poses and sometimes goes beyond. Whalley does neither.

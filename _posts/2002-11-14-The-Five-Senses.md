Spoilers herein.

The problem with this sort of film is that everything  you can get comes from the actors, and the absolute most that they can deliver under these circumstances is truth. But both film and film actors are capable of so very much more that even when these little projects are done well, they lack the greater magic.

Still, sometimes this type of thing captures me. The Altman and Anderson rambles do, even 'Perfume' in its way. Certainly 'Things You can Tell..' though that's serial not parallel. This and 'Lantana' did not, though I have no complaints with the actors. I guess I need something with more teeth than general angst wrapped in a rather poor metaphor. 

And I was expecting so much more, because that metaphor could have been cast in terms of cognition in general meaning the connections and perceptions of the artists to the viewers. The subject of human relationships could have extended to that of them related to us. When the tagline advertised after the style of Egoyan, that's what raised my hopes. Now, an interesting question is how many people think that Egoyan is just about the lives of the characters, that it is constrained to the story? Not many I hope.

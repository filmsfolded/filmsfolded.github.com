I'm easy to entertain, and the digital water was good enough for me. But in a very short time, it will seem ordinary in retrospect. That's because the horror (might, cold) of the water never came across. Even Titanic was better in this regard.

Clooney made wonderful films the last two. Petersen made Das Boot, one of the best ever. Here, I guess everyone thought the digital water would be enough.

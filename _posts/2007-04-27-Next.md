You know, so few of these popped out action movies are good. To be so, they have to have an edge, somehow push the tension and thrill buttons. This doesn't largely because the director isn't capable. And probably because the budget was relatively low.

So don't go to see it. That edge is probably what you are looking for.. But it DOES have some fine things. It starts with a story by P K Dick, and so far as I'm concerned, he's the John Lennon of science fiction. He particularly knows how to play with a bent consciousness and in truth his stories are pretty hard to muck up. Even "Minority Report" for all its sins had that.

It involves premonition on the part of our hero/narrator, and if you pay attention the device is directly in the mainstream of noir fate. This is a big deal, what's happening with film narrative. We have tons of movies now about premonition, time travel, luck, reversed events, parallel events... What's happening I think is a new genre is evolving, much like and as important as what happened with the detective experiments of the 30s. So its fun to watch the visual grammar evolve even if the movie itself is not so great.

I would have seen it even without Dick and in spite of Cage because of Julianne. She's got the chops to deal with folded narrative, and surely that's why she was chosen (as with "Children of Men"). But alas, she seems to have divided her projects into three groups: the ones she cares about and shows us the real stuff, projects like this that are just a paycheck, and movies she makes with her nitwit husband.

A redheaded agent of noir. Its classic.

Oh. There are lots of bits of the story that are unexplained. I appreciated that.

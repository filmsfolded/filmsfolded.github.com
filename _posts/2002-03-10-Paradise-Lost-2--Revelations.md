Spoilers herein.

This is a depressing piece.

It is ostensibly an expose of the injustices committed by the Arkansas legal system because of stereotyping the satanists convicted. Such a thing may have happened, but one will never be able to tell from this video.

That's because the video project itself is an exercise in stereotyping those ignorant southern hillbillies. The intent of the producers is clear: they want to entertain, to entice, to engage, to outrage.

I wish I could believe in ethical journalism, especially in the US, where the whole experiment in democracy depends on an educated public, informed by a free press. But what we have here is a drive to present a story. Just a story.

There aren't many things more loaded than a war movie made by your own country. Cinema is so powerful and there's perhaps an unhealthy overlap between that power and the power of tribalism. We go to these films in part to establish our national identities.

That identity -- the US one, I mean -- has changed from World War II to Vietnam and now again in Iraq, and the shift makes some war movies seem oddly out of focus. This one was a bit out of focus when it was new.

It was started when WWII was only five years from ending. For perspective, the Iraq business has gone on longer than the US engagement in WWII and as I write this 9-11 is five years old. 

Few people appreciate what a strong role the (then brand new) Pentagon had on Hollywood. There were outright subsidies. There were relaxed prosecutions from big things like monopolistic terror to individual violent felonies. There were implicit subsidies as well, often in the form of allowing military assets to be used. So when you see a film that was made during or in the decade after the war, think of that.

For instance, Paris was not considered a romantic city until Hollywood made it so as a deliberate strategy to entice tourists. This still holds today, even though the populace then and now is undeserving. We saw similar efforts (with different values) focused on Japanese topics (noble people, beautiful brides), and other allied cities.

One truly great thing the US has in its history is the rebuilding of Europe and the undoing of the demonizing of the enemy. It really was a noble effort and something to be proud of, a lesson perhaps forgotten now. Along the way, the goal was to pretend that the German war machine, multiple brutalities and holocaust were the product of a few madmen and that the people as a whole were, well, just like us.

So this movie was made, with a lot of Pentagon support. About a quarter of the movie -- all the war footage -- is real footage from the action. That alone should make you interested, seeing men that really would die soon and never get back up.

By today's standards that's several tens of millions of dollars free. In exchange we get a noble portrait of Rommel. The Brits started the story of him being first a good professional soldier who would treat the enemy (the Brits, mostly) with honor and who turned against Hitler, perhaps too late. He also was a good father and husband.

Its questionable history, all elements, plus even Rommel's value as a strategic planner. But it hardly matters. 

What is rather cool to watch are the strings from the minds of the creators to the story, and thence through the screen into our hearts and minds. I'm not one who believes in vast supercompetent government conspiracies. Especially today the competent part. And I know that the Pentagon-Hollywood link is mostly dead, the last partnership being "Top Gun."

But maybe watching this today will do what the best films do: stir you, make you question dimensions of self that you rarely do.

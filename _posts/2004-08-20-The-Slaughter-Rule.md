Spoilers herein.

Dramatic tragedy is a precarious thing as it is balanced between capricious mechanics of fate  and conscious decisions by the character. Only a few scenarios, and fewer approaches can  manage the delicate balance of making this engaging.

Artists who don't have the skill or understanding to effect the balance, instead substitute an  environment which governs all the behavior. No character makes decisions. No control of any  kind is given to anyone. All the characters tumble towards a bleakness not of their doing.

That makes for pretty weak drama, no matter how earnest the actors. That's because you  lose all the drama. The story has nothing to do with what happens. The characters are mere  snowflakes in a blizzard. They merely indicate rather than drive, an actor's nightmare.

This is further limited here by the unrisky approach. It is as if cruel fate came in portion  controlled packages. An example is the clumsy love scene, perfectly unclumsy in its staging,  partly to allow engineered modesty and partly to facilitate borrowed camera angles.

The actors themselves cannot risk because the filmmakers never define the area of risk. So  each actor has to make up his or her own movie. Clea Duvall has the plum role here and she  comes close to hitting home. Its her own invention, but that tone of 'you're not okay' is a  pretty good moment.

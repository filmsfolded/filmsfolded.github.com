In my survey of film are some porn films. A few from the 70's; anything that mixes porn and psychedelics; recent things with cinematic aspirations including old films by Brass, Sarno. Franco.

And anything by Gary Graver. That's because he worked closely with Orson Wells during what is his most important and inaccessible period. I've seen some overlap, even in the most grotesquely banal porn of Gravers'. So I keep watching.

This was done under one of his pseudonyms. He was still working with Wells but the heavy lifting on "Wind" and "fake" was done.

Gravers in this case seems to have just been a cog in an ordinary machine. No clever Shakespeare in this one. No odd camera angles that circumnavigate incidental objects. No exploitation of space, though there are two candidate nice houses here.

No, its just mechanical porn like hundreds of others that year.

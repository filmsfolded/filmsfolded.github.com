We come to these things for a simple reason: we want to feel good. And so did the war weary audience it was made for.

There's a solid compact with the audience. We know we'll see a love story that ends well, or at least according to the formula it seems so. We know we'll have a simple story, one that can be completely encompassed in 20 words.

We also know that at some points, we'll leave that narrative for song and dance.

The core attractions in all this predictability will be the players, the songwriter and the choreographer.

Where in modern films we talk about engagement in the film itself, in these projects we engage directly with these components. And who is better in each of those categories than Garland, Gershwin and Berkeley? 

This should be one of the best films of all time in its class. But problems.

There are some Gershwin masterpieces here. But the arrangements are tepid, misunderstand the intent of the energies and disguise themselves as sappy tunes with some perk. Gosh, what a travesty. Gershwin never wrote film music, but his ability to be in he phrase and out of it at the same time was inherently cinematic.

Judy and Mickey are as charming and committed as always. But if you compare this Judy to the one in "St Louis," they are two different creatures. You can tell in the later one she actually felt pretty. Check out her crying here when the "college/ranch" will be closed, unless of course they "put on a show." (This college has to be one of the strangest in all fiction.) That crying is so fake that it immediately reminds us that this is an imprisoned performer who just cannot wait to sing.

But the real disaster is the Busby routine. Here's a man every bit a giant, and more. Of the three, he changed film the most, creating the basics of human motion in counterpoint. Yes, I know we credit Eisenstein, but Busby's motion was through the intent of people we actually see on the screen. That they drive the pinwheels is something we can trace in all the cinematic dimensions now.

But his stuff was just too expensive, I guess, because he was tossed out before he was able to polish the one sequence we have here. It was originally intended to be in the middle, at the "show." But here it is half-finished and tacked on at the end. Obviously all the low photography was done and the high shots abandoned. Too bad.

Too bad all around. The story has Mickey thrust into a situation that he is unprepared for, so he gets a sore butt. Me too,

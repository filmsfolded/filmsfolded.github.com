Here we have a simple experiment. We are shown extremely moving scenes of inland water. A narrator recounts a fantastic conquest and settlement on the river, dammed to create five lakes. The era is in the future (12474). The exercise apparently is to double the lushness of the images by reference to aural imagination. It works, but don't go out of your way to seek this small experiment.

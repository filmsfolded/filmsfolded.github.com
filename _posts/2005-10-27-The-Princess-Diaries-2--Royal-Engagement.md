There's a checklist in large studios for evaluating date movies. Wedding at the end; check. Impossibly endearing girl paraded in endearing episodes; check.

Girl meets boy, girl loses boy (some non-threatening problem here which the audience knows is less damaging than what she thinks), girl gets boy back. Check, check, check.

The only challenge is the wrapper and the machinery to move from station to station. I myself find it boring unless someone plays some tricks on the formula. Nothing tricky here. But the girl IS very endearing, even if the endearing vignettes seemed tired.

The only remarkable thing in this franchise is that they did what they all such movies infer. The girl is a princess. She gets treated like a princess and deserves it. It is always in the background in other date movies. Why not make it explicit?

Look for the multiple Audrey Hepburn references, including of course the "Roman Holiday" stuff.

I saw this coupled with "Revolutionary Road." 

After "Titanic," Kate chose an amazing project. Its the unappreciated "Hideous Kinky." Its deep, appearing to be shallow and undirected just as the character seems to be. But I find it strangely hypnotic each time I see it. She went in that direction and generally has made intelligent choices about what she does, poor Leonardo has made a mess of his career.

He knows how to be intense. Actually that is the only thing he is truly good at, but it is only recently that he has discovered how to channel that for many uses. At this time in his career: after "Gilbert Grape" and before "Romeo + Juliet," he was truly awful. 

We can't blame this whole disaster on him; there are many screwups. But wow, he is so inept, so untuned to the narrative, so out of touch of what is needed that if all else were right, he would spoil the thing. Interestingly, that is the complete opposite of what the story brings; his character is so intrinsically, so intuitively right that he changes history, changes the world.

This is a replacement comment, the original having been deleted by a vindictive user.

I often fail to understand why John Malkovich gets work. He makes deCaprio look good here.

I remember seeing this when it was new. Ann-Margret was the basis of many fantasies, and really was the product being sold here. Watching it much later in the context other musicals with sexy girls gives a different impression. In fact, Miss Ann's singing and dancing are pretty poor. The main things she has going for her are her photographic hair, her very sexy movement (also cinematic), and her whispering voice. Such voices are associated with the then hot notion of "Sex Kitten."

The movie itself is classic Elvis, which is to say horrible. There's even a scene where Elvis is driving a racecar (actually, he's obviously sitting in a prop with a race backprojected). He is wearing a helmet and goggles, which is to say that no element of the top half of his head is uncovered. Yet he wipes his forehead, as if to show us he's drivin' hard.

As bad as it is, I think this could have been saved with a better set and costume designer. Its all not just bad, but bad for the time. That said, the father's house is the exception: fresh, multilevel, nautically sloped windows on the right.

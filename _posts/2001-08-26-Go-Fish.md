Spoilers herein.

I just came back from a trip visiting an artist whose specialty was lesbian art. Not making, but curating and collecting. She really showed me some stuff that blew me -- a straight guy -- away. Film for me is capable of mainlining the same sorts of effect: The ability (with a little commitment) to transport to new worlds, intensely internal, personal. So I rushed to this film.

Alas, its a miss. It had some powerful images and lines, but it really would have been better, even worldclass as a photo shoot with enticing captions. The production was so unartful -- despite valiant aspirations -- that I felt embarrassed. The acting was largely night-at-the-Y. The dynamics of the camera just weren't understood. Its so strange that for some communities if you speak to them at all with honest intent, they forget all else. In a way, this film is like 'Left Behind,' which fundamentalists love, but most others think is curious but fundamentally blunt and bad art.

Guinevere Turner does have an endearing film presence as the focus. I have seen some of her later films and frankly didn't notice her. But here she is everything.

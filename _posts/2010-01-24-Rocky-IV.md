Somebody's gotta die. Rocky has to find himself and basically learn how to take a punch. 

Along the way, we get:

-- Brigette Nieslen when she had appeal.

-- Possibly the worst collage ever.

-- Already a reach to try to photograph fight scenes differently by adding split screens.

-- A bizarre internationalization of boxing. The last edition deftly handled matters of race. This one assumes that we can buy the same deftness with Rooskies. It is a gamble that did not work at the time, and is comic now.

There is the strange notion that Soviets cheat at sports by using steroids, and that good old American boys don't. This was well past the point when it was known that Sly was having sexual and health problems from steroid abuse. He was hospitalized during this as a result (though the press story had it otherwise).

Between Rocky III and IV, someone bright made "Rocky for Women" (Flashdance) and ran away with the legacy.

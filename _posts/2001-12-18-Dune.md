Spoilers herein.

I saw this when it first came out and recalled it now, more than 15 years later. And you know the main memory? Alicia Witt as the 8 year old prodigy playing a two year old one. She is only in two scenes, but her delivery is the stuff that embosses your memory.

Got me thinking about her subsequent film career. (I don't and won't know her TeeVee work.) I've seen a few of her films and she doesn't show any talent now beyond being pretty and playing the piano. I think Mike Figgis put her in 'Liebestraum' in part because of her role here: she represents the human transformation from the folding of space and time. You can't get that from the Dune movies; you have to read the books. But it is no accident that she is the center of Lynch's movie, the only small gem he could get past the exhibitionistic dumbness of De Laurentiis.

Then, because of the Figgis connection, I am certain Crowe used her as a taliswoman in 'Vanilla Sky,' where she plays the same pivotal role as in 'Liebestraum.' I mean 'pivot' literally as the fulcrum around which origamic visions move.

What an odd presence to have. I'll study some of her other work and get back to you.

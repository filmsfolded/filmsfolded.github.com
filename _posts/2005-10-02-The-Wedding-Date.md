Date movies are a manufactured product. One essential property is its predictability. Girl and boy get together in an unlikely situation. Some crisis drives them apart. Then romantic love drives the reuniting, so much the better if the end includes a wedding and/or a party.

Studio readers have a checklist to eliminate date movies that do not conform. But viewers want SOME variety. You only have two places to innovate. What is the situation that puts the boy and girl together? What is the situation that temporarily drives them apart?

I was really impressed with "Wedding Crashers" in how the solved the first problem. But this one had a clever solution to the second problem. In part that is because the two problems were solved by two interrelated plot lines. Good structure. remember the bit about heart transplants?

Then it is all simply a matter of texture and appeal. Jokes, pacing, lightness, readability. This first time filmmaker fails on this score, so if you take these things seriously, if you actually count on them to reinforce your romantic fantasies, if you are so hampered in the management of your life you actually NEED this, you will be disappointed.

But if you are following the evolution of script devices for date movies, stay tuned to this and what may follow.

Redhead note: Redheads factor heavily in the iconography of the date movie. Here, the troubled woman who is the main event has her hair artificially reddened, while her equally troubled sister, normally a lush redhead, is turned super blond.

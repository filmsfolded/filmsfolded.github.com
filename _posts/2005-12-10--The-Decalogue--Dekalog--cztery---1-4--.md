You really cannot be a centered adult these days unless you seriously look for where the razorblades are hidden in the beachsand. Any of the rich experiences in life can tear as well as nourish.

Art is our only defense. Cinema is our most visceral art. Within that, Kieslowski knows wounds from frolicking -- dangerous breathing -- as well as any and better than nearly anyone. 

This is to say that everyone should watch "Decalog." No, more than watch it, you should accept it in the way it is formed, a series of emotional encounters that relentlessly teases you into baffling conundrums. No escape.

These are tools for life and really should be seen as originally intended, in sequence over a couple weeks. Do it with the person you love, because love is the price of entry into these.

This one is a message that you can either interpret or make up as you wish, about a message that might have been made up.

(The spoiler is: there is a letter and its forgery. Both are hidden but not. At the end, one is burned but you do not know which one.)

Within this story is a sequence in acting class, where the young girl and her older male teacher act out love. This exercise folds into the "real" play we see. Who is acting? Who is fooling themselves? Who can escape fooling themselves about love? Which messages are genuine?

If you just encounter this by itself, you may think it a simple, beautiful drama. But if you see this as one of ten, it is already the fifteenth colorful Persian carpet murderously unfurled under you and your lover.

It cuts.

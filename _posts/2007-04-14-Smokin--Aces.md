There's something rather wonderful about lucid reception of stories. You aren't bound to take them the way they are intended; if you weave a strong enough story yourself, you can find new paths for what you receive. The opposite effect happens also; if you have a given story (like religious and political wackos) you MUST twist things to fit.

It seems the best defense against this is the lucid exercise of freeing yourself from the tyranny of imposed stories by playing with what you encounter as stories, shifting them in and out of your reality. I've noticed that our best black comedians give their audience the illusion that they are doing this shifting from making fun of certain stories and then inviting them into those very stories. 

You can do this yourself with any movie, and I sometimes do. But the best movies to do this with are ones that are overloaded with good story material that is managed poorly. When a story is not coherent, it gives you narrative space to weave it as you will. Thats's what we have here, a particularly bad film rich with possibilities, a sort of tinkertoy narrative kit.

There's one big container, a story about a dying mafia boss wanting his chief rival and presumptive stoolie killed. Some part of this plan is overheard imperfectly and a bevy of surrogate stories are formed among a number of groups we see and follow. That's why I like this movie so much: its premise is based on the very thing -- the only thing -- it is good for, substitute storytelling to parallel "reality." 

The misinterpretation is that a million dollars go to the crew that kills the target, a certain Isreal (what a name) who himself is a magician, someone who is expert at making a story seem something it is not. 

The second collection of stories is within this framing device and concerns the groups involved: some crazy Nazi stepbrothers, two hiphop lets say urban women who happen to be lovers, three excops, a master of disguise (who knows something we do not), and two groups of FBI agents, one discalced. Its this last group that takes control of the story at the end we see, confounding the "official" agents. All of these groups are extreme film stereotypes, which works against the presumed intent, but for our adventure. 

You already know that the actual storytelling of the thing is inept, and its dangerously uncinematic. 

But you can have fun with it. Several people turn out as masters of disguise. Several deals are being worked. There are several "belonging" stories, in fact they dominate. 

This isn't "Memento" or "Fight Club," but if you are clever enough you can build your own.

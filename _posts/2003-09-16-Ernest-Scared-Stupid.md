Spoilers herein.

It seems that humor is not something we are born with, but something we learn, like  language. And like language and the sense of self, you have a limited number of  abstraction mechanisms to choose from.

In other words, funniness is what funny people do, and there are only a few types of  funny. Some, we acquire late in life. This sort of goofiness comes earlier, so when adults  are exposed to it, we feel a little pang of nostalgia. We even seek it out, as something we  giggled about before sexual humor washed over us.

Its a matter of acting dumb in a way that everyone knows you are not, about speaking  directly to the audience as if you were talking to yourself ("and now the world famous  batter comes to the plate..."), and of making the goofiest faces you can. That's it, those  three things. Yes, it is stupid, childish and shallow -- that's the point.

But check out how intelligently the writers have accommodated this. It is all a matter of  wearing costumes, of appropriating and manipulating puppets or dolls, of working  ancient formulae for your own ends. Of making adults look as silly as kids. We equate  this to a pureness of heart, and probably rightly so.

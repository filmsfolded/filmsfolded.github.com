Spoilers herein.

Long ago, I swore off John Carpenter movies. I revel in junk; I get great enjoyment out of reinventing films in my mind. But he is just too much. His ineptitude is uninteresting. His values are drug-dulled. He's not even twisted, just stupid. This movie, for instance features a fight on top of a speeding train, complete with an exploding disconnected car.

But this film has Clea Duvall in it. Clea isn't the best actress in the world, but she is an actress. I follow some actresses because they really do something rare and valuable. But others I follow because they are totems in the film world. Alicia Witt is such a totem to filmmakers - just having her in a scene carries special meaning in the project. Clea is becoming one of these. Her roles in '13 Conversations' and 'Identity' put her in the middle of an archetype of hidden dreamers, dreaming our dreams.

And guess what? This film also has Joanna Cassidy who played the very same role in the best science fiction film of all time! (One complication of that story is that the whole thing could be an imagined performance of hers.) So I checked it out, and discovered that their appearance here is something of an accident, to judge by how they are used.

But if you wish, you can avoid wasting the experience by making up your own film while watching this, exploiting the Clea/Joanna totem.

In this version, Melanie's drugs invent Bashira and later Whitlock as avatars to fight the Martian ghosts as they create their own avatars. Joining in this is Desolation, who has a similar power, also drug-induced. The entire film (like 'Identity') happens in a psychically-created world, following the 'Dr Strange' convention of evil magical beings versus good ones and all of them conjured by someone else.

Check it out: Whitlock's balloon, Bashira's jaw, where Desolation goes from the train, just who the tribunal is. It's work because you are helping Melanie dream up someone clever (Bashira), knowing she herself was dreamed up by someone (Carpenter) remarkably unclever.

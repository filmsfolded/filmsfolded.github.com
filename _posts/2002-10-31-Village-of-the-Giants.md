Spoilers herein.

This is not as dumb as it looks. Sure, it has cheezy effects, bad acting, improbable situations, and screwy dialog. But so do nearly all the movies from this period.

You can see this in several interesting ways:

--This was when the larger society was beginning to know about LSD, and associating it with the impression of 'beats' on teenagers. It is after the rock and roll scare and just before the serious hippie scare. Here we have the drugs and sex version of 'Rebel Without a Cause,' but done poorly of course.

--I am beginning a study of redheads in film. Check this out. The 'bad' teenagers (sometimes 6 sometimes 8) are three blond girls plus at the end a brownhaired one. The 'good' teenagers are led by a red, Nancy, who has a red brother ('Genius') and a red friend (Georgette who does a sexy dance to distract the baddies), and if you look, and inordinate number of red friends in the crowd. Bad blonds versus good reds. Interesting. Toni Basil makes an appearance as a redhead gogo dancer.

--The writers went immediately to 'Lord Love a Duck' which was a truly intelligent, dark film: black pyschedelia. One of them was apparently in love with the redhead, Vicki London, who appears in both. Look for her. Anyway, these guys knew 'Alice in Wonderland' and put the bad teens literally on a stage, where they are approached by the sheriff. A pretty clever conceit, I say.

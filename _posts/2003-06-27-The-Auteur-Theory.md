Spoilers herein.

I am deep into a study for a book on folding in film. "Folding" is a general term for  various types of selfreference, awareness, self-creation and reflection. The very idea  behind my study is that this is a very useful thing to understand and use because it  makes things more powerful. When exposed as the point of the art -- as in "Adaptation"  or any number of similar films -- it serves as a fun playground, for particularly intelligent  games.

This film puts the lie to that. It doesn't work. It isn't fun. It DOES march through a few of  the folding types I have categorized: films about other films, films that make themselves,  films about the pretense of folding, films where the game of detecting gets wrapped up  in both the story and the story about the story. Judges judging judges.

Metadocumentaries.

But there isn't a shred of cleverness, not a speck of fun. Even "Final Cut" was better. What  could have made this work was better reflection between the two panels of judges and  the revelation that the redhead executive was the murderer for reasons having to do with  artificially enhancing the folding.

When Chris Guest tried this, he knew that the films within the film within the film had to  be really good. JJ Leigh worked in "The Big Picture."

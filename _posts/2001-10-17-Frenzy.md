Spoilers herein.

I find most of Hitchcock's films badly dated. The acting is generally poor, and the notions of suspense unengaging. Hitchcock's importance to me is 1) that he successfully conveys a coherent vision, 2) (as with Kubric) the narrative isn't very important, merely an excuse for visual communication 3) in creating those visions, he has a clever eye.

That last one makes some of his work pretty exhilarating. That's even though all his effects are part of the common vocabulary now, and have been vastly exceeded because of further experimentation. More importantly, current camera technology makes his camera seem tired, generally unaminated. However, 'Rear Window' is still great because of how he created his world to accommodate the camera.

And this film is okay because it has some impressive sequences. The 'goodbye Babs' and potato truck scenes show superb timing and vision, and working as they did in those days they could have only been imaged thus beforehand.

I wonder why IMDB doesn't make an effort to include the body doubles in the cast list. In this case, they did as much acting as the stars. (The DVD's documentary has a brief shot of Bab's double.)

Spoilers herein.

Viewers, beware of movies that depend on sentiment alone. It is a sort of porn and has the effect of covering a hollowness of content or engagement. This film will push buttons, but you'll feel dirty coming out of it.

There are a couple good actresses here. Too bad they were just asked to idle their engines. Anyone who has seen Redgrave really cook will appreciate that the director here has a TeeVee mentality.

Insights are translated into ideas and then into spoken words then letters, coded, light, code again and letters again and words spoken by a boy that result in insights. That's ten levels of abstraction around the wheel of folding. Intelligent films that attempt this will add value at each step, watchable films only a few. Besides letting us know about the steps, this film adds value at no point.

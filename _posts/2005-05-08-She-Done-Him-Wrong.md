If you want to lucidly watch movies, you have to understand what they are. To do that, you need to see the battle over the definition for what audiences thought movies should be, an extension of stage entertainment, plays, photography, literature, radio and other contenders. This was fought in the five years 1929 to 35.

Part of that great competition was vaudeville's entry: a combination of skits and stage acts. The humor was likely blue and all the stories about crime and sex. In movies of this type, the main characters would always be show people who would take to the stage here and again for inserted bits that naturally fit with the story.

What makes this particular film interesting is that it is more than just vaudeville-influenced; it is a successful vaudeville production, written by its star. The struggle for control over what movies would be was largely determined by which audience dwindled and which grew. But that wasn't the case with vaudeville. Audiences loved the sex jokes. But this type of contestant lost because the US government stepped in after this film (and largely because of this film) and outlawed sex on screen, any mention or reference to it or anything connected to it.

Non-American readers: I'm not making this up. Movies today are an accidental evolution of many forces plus one coming from government nannies. Watch this today and be shocked and perverted by its content!

Other than this foolishness, there's a remarkable artifact of the translation from stage to screen. Mae West was old, not very attractive and even by contemporary standards unshapely. None of this would have mattered on stage. Bringing her persona to screen creates a strange dissonance, another joke. West plays someone so compellingly sexy that every man in the city desires her.

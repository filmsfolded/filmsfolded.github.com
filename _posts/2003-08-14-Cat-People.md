Spoilers herein.

Pity Paul Schrader. He loves movies but is oblivious to storytelling. So his movies --  whether he writes or directs -- always focus on some fairly simple cinematic ideas. One  should approach his projects as less of a meal than a cooking show.

In this case, we have a few cooking tricks worth watching. The most obvious of course is  Ms Kinski. Like Mia Farrow, she has done her most beguiling work with directors with  whom she was sleeping, one of whom (in both cases) was Polanksi; they both adjusted  and expanded film sexuality toward vulnerability; they both starred in an artistic horror  film as first a reluctant then a willing player. 

Both of them, incidentally were daughters of show business people, had a long  relationship with a world class musician and in later life became active in humanitarian  endeavors. In both cases, those lover-directors unlocked normally inaccessible nuances  in the face. Interesting, that. She made Michelle Pfeiffer's mouth possible.

Here, the story has Moxie, literally. It is to my mind a minor "Sgt Pepper" of films: the last  drug-supported studio film; the last one done using analog methods. (Anyone who  listens to "Sgt. Pepper" on vinyl in the original 4-channel mono mix will know what I  mean. It has an open, honest depth in its texture -- just like Nastassja.) Like Sgt. Pepper,  is in a exploration into the erotic nature of texture, color, even spiritual perversion.  Something between Bertolluci and "The Cell," and about as successful.

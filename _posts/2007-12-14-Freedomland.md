For me, a film doesn't have to be good to be worthy if it is part of a journey I share with an artist. I just saw "Vacuuming Nude" by Boyle. Its a fantastic failure, but one you register against contexts you bring to his successful projects. Some artists are worth the investment. Its as simple as that. You need to walk with them through the dark areas and get cut also.

Julianne Moore is one of the few actors for whom I've made that decision. Its because she had a period in there of extreme ability, probably acquired. She was a nothing, then participated in some amazing workshops in layered techniques, producing the "Vanya on 42nd Street," a sort of masterpiece. 

Then followed some years where she was in the Cate/Kate class. Inexplicably, she became involved with a man who is cinematically, even dramatically dull, and some years of ordinariness returned. She's bright enough to know this, which is why she attached herself to this. 

As originally planned, it would have been by Winterbottom, one of an elite group of serious filmmakers committed to seriously exploring the form while respecting an actor's aspirations. For reasons unknown to me, he left. I suppose that a lessor man would have lived with some compromise or another. In this case it may well have been the acceptance of Jackson and the muddle of context that's presented here.

His "flaws" are all too manufactured. He's got a son in prison and an absent wife. He's in the middle of a theatrically centered struggle in the police force. He's a delicately balanced agent in some simple racial dynamics. He's a good man, sketched in incomplete ways. All this is supposed to introduce some complexity as he gets engaged with Moore's character.

But this situation is incoherent, so the world in which we see Moore's character simply doesn't exist. Winterbottom could have made it work, probably with a real actor, one who finds characters instead of reuses his own.

So we are left with a bunch of scattered dramatic toys surrounding what Moore is doing. But what she's doing is enough for you to spend time with this. She's attempting to re- engage with that level of being that she as an actor once had. Like her character, the surrounding circumstances don't help. She's alone in her struggle to connect. She's figuratively, killed her child.

The way she approaches her character is different than anything she has done before. She's very physical. She moves her upper torso and particularly her mouth in ways that we've never seen before. She allows herself to become possessed by some controlling being not in her domain, external. 

It doesn't work in the story, of course, because the story doesn't work. But the character is darned effective. We do see at least two beings in there, merged in a way that seems to matter. We do see some of her seeing other elements of herself, fighting and negotiating, coexisting in dynamically changing ways. There's an internal story we can glimpse.

One scene does work, and its the one the title hangs on. Another woman, structured in the same way but more in control is helping Moore's character search for her lost son. They are in an abandoned institution for lost children, called Freedomland. There's an outer negotiation between the two that mirrors what Moore's created internally. Its brilliant. Its supposed to (I guess) be the dual of similar connections Jackson's character cannot make.

See it. See a soul lost to us, struggle to swim back.

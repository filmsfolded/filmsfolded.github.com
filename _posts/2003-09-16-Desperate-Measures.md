Spoilers herein.

Michael Keaton is what Nic Cage thinks he is and Mickey Rourke wishes he were: intense  enough to burn a character through his skin from the inside.

You have to be a master of comedy to pull this off, because you have to know what the  limit is, so that you can barely exceed it. I admire this actor, and think he has been  poorly served, especially in this mess. There's not a shred of imagination or craft in the  writing or directing. But at least he gets a change to show his craft. Opening shots are  promises -- watch how he handles his introductory scenes as the waterbag lifting  psycho.

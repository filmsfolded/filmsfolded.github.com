Spoilers herein.

Hitchcock's work is as good as any to study for the impermanence of style. Let's completely set aside the clothes, the conceit about German spies/mothers-in-law, the obviously fake sets and the trite plot devices (uranium in bottles, poison in coffee). We are still left with two levels of style. 

I suppose it is arguable whether these are styles. I call them styles because they are imposed by society, were a major part of the original charm of the work, and now are noticeably out of place, replaced by a new set.

The first concerns what it means to be cinematic: the staging, the framing and the relationship of lights to eye. Hitchcock was both a master and an innovator of the first two. But he was steeped in the theatrical tradition. Every actor showed that they knew where the camera was. The action comes to the camera, not the other way around. The perspective is constant, and at seated eye-level, seldom moving about as a disembodied observer might. This is obsolete today, even in the most mundane films. 

The second deals with modern acting. Hitchcock WAS modern sixty years ago. While he had one foot in the theater and an obligation to tell a story, he has the other foot in modern self-awareness. Incidentally marked by his walkons, his more pervasive use was how the actors winked at the camera. Grant was a master of this with his smile that was intended primarily for the viewer. So we have Grant in two persona: Devlin, and the actor playing Devlin. Now Hitchcock adds a familiar mix: Devlin and Alicia's characters become actors themselves. She to deceive the bad guys, he to deceive he.

Actors playing actors is quite old (Shakespeare's favorite device) but to make it all self-referential comes from modern French comedy. Inserting the notion into 'realistic' film was the Hitchcock innovation. But this style is passe today, as the sophistication of viewers has moved on. Now we have extremely multileveled, simultaneous roles even in our most low-brow films ('Nurse Betty'). Now we have the camera acting as a character. Now we have shifting narrative stances.

All this shows the danger of being a stylish filmmaker -- you go out of style and your film just stops working. This film is of historical interest only -- it only works if you deliberately assume the mantle of the past -- which is enjoyment enough for some.

Bergman IS lovely, and I think if she were acting today, she wouldn't be so stiff; and I presume this would detract from her appeal. Check out her daughter for instance in "Fearless."

This film is historically interesting, but (except for the kid) not particularly good moviewatching.

Its historical import is usually considered as an example -- probably the first -- of the heist genre: the standard format is: 1) the collection of the crew 2) the performance of the heist, usually as a matter of spectacular competence and 3) the unravelling, but only if it is a European heist movie.

The genre is a particular type of folding, a meticulously planned project that we watch within a larger project (the film) that we watch. The perfection of the first is carried to the second, giving us the impression of deeper engagement. An effective trick.

This happens to also be a good example of where that effect works well because this isn't a very good film, but it _seems_ expert because the centerpiece event was perfect. The only flaw was passion.

As it happens, during this time there was a huge battle for the cinematic between French and Italian styles of storytelling. The French approach was (and still is) cerebral while the Italian is based on personal contact and engagement in spite of reason. Just like the characters here. Because this is a French film, the careful plan is unravelled by the impetuous Italian. Both types screw around, but the Frenchie has his woman situation managed.

It is photographed well.

While the rest of the art world has gone on to explore more and more interesting corners of art, the French are stuck in the sixties. That is because French film is heavily subsidized (by taxes on viewers of "foreign" films), and the subsidized films have to be characteristically "French."

Since the referees are all old guys, this means French film is still stuck somewhere in the past. We have here the standard French formula: you must focus on a pretty girl in contrite involved sexual situations; you must develop (but only partially) a hopeless angst, and you must directly reference a French poet.

If you like ersatz art, this "smooth jazz" art film might engage. But for me it is a fake art, subsidized shallowness.

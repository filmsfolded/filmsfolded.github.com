Spoilers herein.

'The Shining' was a truly risky idea: make the hotel an actual character, in fact the primary character containing and directing all the others. So in standard Kubrick fashion, there was a movie within a movie, the inner movie being that written and directed by the hotel.

This pale copy misses that basic core. Instead it assumes that you can build a movie around two women with nice shapes and funny faces.

Spoilers herein.

Australians pride themselves on being direct, but Australian cinema is anything but. It is  one of the most engaging trends in film today and -- so far as I can tell -- we first see it  here. Actually we first see an inkling in "Walkabout,: a film set in Australia but by a Brit. It  conflated constructed realities, Aboriginal mysticism embedded in the environment, and  adolescent sexual awakening as metaphor for narrative awareness,

That film made overt negative comment on the (then popular) Italian philosophy of film  as stories embedded in characters. 

This is very much the same film, except the conceptual distance between it and  "Walkabout" is the same as between "Walkabout" and "Amarcord." It is a remarkably  sophisticated idea: to create a drama with essentially no story arc, where the characters  are not prime movers but elements of the environment -- where sex has less to do with  panting and ejaculation and more with universal intimacy, what we see and some  unnamed yearning that we all recognize.

This is a film that changed the world, but my own theory is that it reflects rather than  leads a larger awareness among Australian artists. And that all comes from one or two  teachers at the Opera House, which in turn was awakened by the implied hidden forms in  the design of that structure. 

The idea is that film is not a play, that what you experience is not what the players show  -- instead what they help you show yourself in your imagination. We can see this in the  folded acting of Winslet and Kidman, in the projection into the next scene of Crowe. In  the several mystical spaces of secrets Blanchett ephemerally sustains.

Many films along these lines fail, I'm thinking of Gillian Armstrong, Sally Potter and Jane  Campion. Even this film is not widely admired and Weir himself evolved into "message"  films. But thanks to Australia and New Zealand we have a particular approach to film that  is cinematic. It tussles for control over our imagination with other memes in film: the  Hollywood "film as play," the British "film as set," the Italian "film as characters," the  Swedish "film as visited angst," the Hong Kong "film as ballet,"

What we have here in the Australian entry is closer to the Japanese "film as means to  abstraction whereby one purifies reality by alert immersion."

One trick that I particularly appreciate is the focus on reading and how that is tied to  what we think are clues to the mystery. We see a teacher in the wild reading a geometry  text. We see the geometry text clearly; the camera dwells on a particular graphic which in  a British/Hitchcock film means: "pay attention, here is something that will be important  later on." Then we switch to an overhead shot of the girls in trance on a rock. They are  carefully arrayed. This is a staged scene, which obviously relates to the drawing in the  book. Subconsciously that part of our mind that is tracking the mystery is racing ahead.  Simultaneously, that part of our eye that makes sense of patterns is puzzled.

None of this is ever closed and that makes the effect much more powerful. Not only was  the clue never resolved, the hands holding it disappeared -- as if we charmed the scene  into mischief by our watching.

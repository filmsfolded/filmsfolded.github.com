Spoilers herein.

Our Katherine had already been a success in one prior film, and only 5 years into the era  of talkies, they retooled Alcott's story to suit her personality. It worked, but was her last  success until the intense re-engineering of the Philadelphia story.

That re-engineering was a massive change: Hepburn recast as richly eccentric rather  than charmingly brash. For her entire life, she was amazingly incomplete as an actress  but knew how to play the personality game she overtly derided. But this was all before  that.

Here, she moves with exaggerated movements and a severe phrasing of her lines. That  specific style was consciously adopted from Shirley Temple and (long after Hepburn had  abandoned it) popularized by Judy Garland. It features short phrases, with a rising lilt but  short of the questioning tone that submissive girls use today.

Cukor stages this much like a play, with some extraordinarily long takes. The stagey  nature of the production is as far from life and realistic movies as Jo's parlor play was  from the world of the story. The sound is murky and the lighting muddy.

The film was popular because it sweetens the book in absurd ways. Louisa May was an  important writer, one that really did change the world in a way. Her tone was one of  disciplined self-reinvention orthogonal to all the false romanticism of the age. The  notable feature of 'Little Women' was that Jo unexpectedly escaped the form of the  Austen novel, and thereby the strictures of society that Austen emphasized. This was not  a matter of brattish tomboy energy as Hepburn would have it, but a matter of a woman  transcending the narrow channels available to her sisters.

Just as Hepburn gets this exactly the opposite of what Jo is about, so does the whole film  spit in Alcott's eye. The very essence of the book is to escape the formula of syrupy  romanticism. The target of this film is to be thoroughly syrupy, all the way to the  repellent sweetness of the score.

Winona's 'Women' was flawed in different ways, but more true to Bronson Alcott's vision.

Spoilers herein.

I don't know what sins Keanu committed. But someone felt that he needed to be punished, so doomed him to this film. That it is about the same situation is the only sweetness.

I have no idea why someone would think we need another Ducks, or Bears film. I suppose the pitch was that this includes some trademarked 'raw truths.' Wrong. What we get instead is a predictable parade of stereotypes. The genre rather demands it, but it is irresponsible in the circumstances. Is this really any more ennobling than, say 'Romeo Must Die.'

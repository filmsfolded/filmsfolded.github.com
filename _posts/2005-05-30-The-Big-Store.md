Naturally you know that this is considered one of the weakest of Marx films. 

The sad fact is that when your act is based on excess, you have to continually up the ante. This was true 70 years ago and is just as true now, whether you are talking comedy or its sibling, adventure.

Even if they weren't getting tired, and didn't have creative block, and had medical and marital problems... even if they just stayed as frantic as they were when they did the first New York films, they would have been bad.

This is a sad, sad, film. The core of the thing is a chase through the store that destroys it. This depends on a physical comedy that the boys never had and that was intended to evoke similar scenes (especially the rollerskating) from Keaton and Chaplin.

Most of this work here is done by obvious stunt doubles. Please see one of the earlier films again instead.

Spoilers herein.

This is rather dreary and of historical interest only. But what history! Its amazing how quickly we adopted standard conventions pertaining to rockets, rayguns and such. One convention has fallen by the wayside: gangsters in cahoots with anti-government forces.

The rocket suit and helmet would later be copied for 'Rocketeer.' The Commander Cody character plays a major role in the forthcoming (as I write this) final installment of the Star Wars saga.

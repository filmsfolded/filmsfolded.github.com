I've been very critical of the Suchet Poirot adaptations. They are often silly and compromise the detection part of the mystery so. They trade entertainment for engagement, beauty for the puzzle, faces and places instead of narrative complexity.

And for a while there it seemed that the later ones got worse as the secondary characters became beloved and "fleshed out."

But this one is excellent just excellent. The production values are superb. Compare the way the train is used to the faux claustrophobia of the Lumet "Orient Express." This one features less mechanically in the story so far as the possibilities of who could be where at what time, but the geometry of the thing is pretty complex still. I liked the way the camera was shown to be observing, with blurry foreground objects. Its Poirot's virtual eye, you see, not God's or we would have known who did it right off.

Some things are changed from the book, but all in the service of better cinema so I applaud, especially as the characters are more true to Agatha than any other Suchet production I've seen. And we have that great "parlor" scene at the end where Poirot does his standard explanation of how each suspect did it.

Most of these are dreadful, but this is competent cinematically, so I give it a three:

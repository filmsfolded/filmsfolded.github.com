If you think Austen is all about mere story, there's still something to talk about. In the end, things work out despite the structural imperfections of the world which work against happy endings. If that's your take, if it is all about story for you, this is a perfect movie. 

Because it works. And it works in spite of some horrible missteps, some absolutely bad decisions that should cripple it. There are a surplus here, enough to have killed a similar movie. And yet it works. Yes, everyone finds romance at the end, but what I mean is also that we fall in love with the movie.

Why? Three reasons.

The actresses really are centered, the key ones. The characters aren't Austenian in manner, but they are as abstract and dramatic as hers are. Because these actresses don't have to play real, nuanced people, they get to pour all their skills into the three or so characteristics each is supposed to have. The funny thing is that the chords they strike as a group seem to be acceptable. Its not a play about life, but a play about a fictional world of romance that itself relates to life, or so we accept. So the actresses work. Emily Blunt is a power, and I am committed to follow her. She makes good choices.

There are some truly endearing sequences. Its fewer than half, and they are interwoven with some real mistakes. But they are powerful enough to allow us to skim over the badness in the movie. I believe that in part this is because the nature of the story and the being of the characters is to do that. So the two tractors of continuance in the face of incompetence make the incompetence irrelevant. 

And then there's the big idea, what I call the fold. We have the movie. We have the books. We have the people in the movie reading the books and comparing themselves to what they read. We have us "reading" the movie and doing likewise, but slightly differently. We have us reading what the writer of the script did in terms of overlapping the four of these, and us wondering whether we will follow 21st or 19th century conventions (and being pleased to progressively find the latter). Its a simple fold but interesting because it is so overt. Its even underscored by the appearance of that usual folding device: a school play about love where the actor gets to relate to his love off-stage and tell her he loves her.

You may be wondering about the sequences that are missteps. Austen depicts a world that is profoundly broken, but instead of pounding us with it, she presents the breaks through humor, humorous characters mostly, who present attitudes that collectively circumnavigate the world. Austen called this "irony," though the definition has changed twice since then. This writer-director tries this in a way, by introducing situations we might know from old TeeVee sitcoms. There's the computer geek's house that is set up with scary gismos. There's the same geek comparing Austen to Star Wars. And yet this same geek is the fulcrum of many of the most powerful presentations of tentative commitment.

There's a moment when Blunt's character is making a tough choice and literally sees a blinking sign wondering "what would Jane do?" This is bad in so many ways. There are a dozen such spots where you wonder what they were thinking.

This reminds me of some successful people I know. They are deeply inadequate in fundamental ways, but they know how to use their strengths to comb over the thin spots.

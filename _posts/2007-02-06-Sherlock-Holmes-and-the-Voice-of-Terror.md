Usually with these Holmes movies, I get caught up in some metanarrative about the nature of the British people and how they redefined themselves during the war. Or perhaps I wonder about how this truly novel idea of having a character that discovers the story has been coopted.

But this Holmes project is unusual. It is photographed so dramatically, it is a cross between "M" (ironically) and "Casablanca" of the same year (in fact Terror and Casablanca were in production at the same time, but of course with scant possibility of overlap). 

The story is typical, and everything else except how carefully this was framed and lit. And that leads me to a conundrum. When "Citizen Kane" came along (just the year before), among its other narrative inventions was the technique of anticipative framing. That means that each shot is composed not to show what's happening in the shot, but primarily to provide a memory to hold when you are in the next shot. It was an amazing invention, made more radical because as all the other narrative experiments were visited, this anticipative framing adapted to the mode of the moment. In later Welles projects, especially the ones we don't fully have, the arc of the film wasn't in the story at all -- what we normally think of as the story -- but in the rhythm of this narrative dance.

Kane changed everything and immediately. You can see it here, but not everyone could follow the dynamic nature of what they had seen.

With that background, what we have here is each shot composed in the manner natural to the stage and amplified by the Germans. Ironic. The idea here is to use the frame to "illustrate" the scene. There are four key sets here. The first is the room of the "inner council:" ceilingless and huge. The radio is bigger than a car. Then you have an underground bar, an abandoned warehouse and finally a destroyed remote church. Each reflects some element of the other. Each allows some mystery.

In all these the people move in and across in very studied and elaborate motions. It's very German; it's what a German would want to do to Kane, so its strange that the story is about rooting out German moles in influential places.

And it is doubly strange given Holmes' talent. No matter whose adaptation you encounter, Holmes is a man who can see what others cannot (its almost always sight) and who takes the features of that vision to the "next step." So if any movie character could use the new vision of Kane, it would be Holmes. Nope, not here; the Nazis win. But it is a beautiful war.

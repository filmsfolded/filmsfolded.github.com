Going to the movies is a great adventure for me, and as people have asked me over the years, I've developed a sense of two qualities that I value.

One is the mastery of cinematic values, and I was surprised to find that here. The surprise is because I've to my knowledge only seen one other Woo film: 'Face Off.' That seemed nervous and uncontrolled, rather like Nick Cage. Also, I'm normally no fan of Cruise: his instrument is puggish with a big nose and squeeky voice -- he struts too much for me. And summer movies normally bore me with all their me-tooisms,

But here (as with 'Gladiator') is great understanding and control of the motion on the screen, of the anticipation of the movement of the eye, of the mastery of sequenced colors. Thankfully with this, and at this pace, we don't need much acting or story. I'd say Woo is somewhat stupid in many of the storytelling and human engagement values. But gosh, he's got the motion right. And that matters.

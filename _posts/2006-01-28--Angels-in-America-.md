Chances are, if you are reading this, you are wondering whether this will be a worthwhile rental. It is a 6 hour investment, after all. In that time, you could view three or four theatrical films, or view one really good one and just ruminate on it for four hours.

The essence of the thing is a play, a successful play by an accomplished playwright. As such, it does what plays are expected to do: explore relatively unknown emotional territory and to map that into ordinary experience but with more intensity. Usual techniques of overlapping personalities and urges are used, so we have political power, personality dominance, sexual roles and "love" relationships woven together and implicitly conflated.

When you go to a play, it involves real humans presenting these notions to you, so the "medium of touch" maps well into the messages involving touch. Thus we have at the beginning of the food chain a play that works as a play.

Now we come to HBO, which is desperate to fill space with something that is engaging and also outlawed or otherwise impossible on the competing channels. So the thing is transformed from what it is, where the actors are without identity, where indeed one of the devices used is having actors take multiple roles. It is, it must be transformed into something that uses recognizable personalities as players. So we have Pacino, Streep, Parker and others all playing what we think of them as.

This transformation takes all the blood out the thing, except by comparison to the rest of TeeVee. But if you are reading this, it is not other TeeVee shows that are your alternatives.

Then, after these two phases where the shape of the thing is frozen, in steps Mike Nichols. The man really knows his way around the vocabulary of dramatic effects, for sure. But pretty much all he can do here is play with the notion of the large embossed on the individual. And for this, he chooses a single device: grand changes of scale with single sweeps of the camera.

So for instance the first shot where we zoom in on the earth, sweep across the US from San Franciso through cities that don't matter, to New York. Zooming further in to Central Park, then a statue and then on the face of the statue as if our ghost-eyes have landed and are looking up from "human" level. Then the statue shows us that it is alive. All seamless movements, you understand.

A blunt device: the large embossed on the small, the small on the human. We have this one device echoed loudly once each "episode." And it is referenced in some of the "dream" sets: human statues, distance withdrawals at key moments.

It is just too much, too trite. There IS value simply in watching Nichols regardless of the dramatic scaffold he has to assume. But don't spend 6 hours of leftovers on it. See "Catch 22" instead.

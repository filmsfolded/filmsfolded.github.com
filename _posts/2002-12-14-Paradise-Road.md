Spoilers herein.

Beresford lives in a simple world, one with simulated evil. Into this he places characters to indicate but not express drama.

I have two problems with this film. The first is a matter of simple history. The Holocaust was remarkable because it was mechanized, but Japanese brutality was far more universal: there was no honor in any Japanese man in this theater of war. No honor. The brutality was racial, universal and extreme. 1997 sensibilities soften what really happened, and that's a real shame.

The second problem is the matter of the drama. Most film never attempts reality, and play with different formulas of depicting the real. But when the attempt is to actually convey reality, the company involved has to make a commitment to sacrifice. 'Platoon' s company made that sacrifice. Dennis Quaid make the sacrifice for 'Wyatt Earp.' This film does not. Sure, the ladies are dirty, and they are there when we see some nasty things. Some of them die.

But these are remarkably goodnatured, healthy-looking people who mouth artificial words. They line up well in the courtyard. They don't menstruate. There is no lesbianism. There is no hate. It comes through as filtered fond memories of a hard time.

Oh well, watch it for Cate: I rewatched this because it was Cate Blanchett's first film. Already you can tell that she works differently than those around her: she's committed, she's IN the character. She already is working with multiple personalities: her nurse, the older person's memory of the nurse, and her portrayal of both.

But here's something interesting: hair color. Cate is naturally a redhead, and the harsh Sumatran sun makes even brown hair seem red. Jennifer Ehle is a reddish brunette. Beresford had both of these women darken their hair, while he assigned the red hair to Susie Porter (Oggi), a blond.

Female red hair means something special in films, and the art director decided to avoid it in the main characters. (This is no inexperienced art director: he would next do Malick's terrific 'Red Line' and go on to do a Star Wars pic.) The main characters had to be 'weighty:' no redheads allowed.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4: has some interesting elements.

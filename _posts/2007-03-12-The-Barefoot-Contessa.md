You can't really dive into film without encountering the Mankiewicz brothers. Here we have writer-director Mankiewicz creating a character who is a writer and director, a very good one. Like Woody Allen, his writing is better than his directing. This is a soulless movie with a bad rhythm, but the writing is expert. Its written in the neonoir form with the role of fate and the prominence of the narrator. 

A device here is that the narrator shifts among three men, the director, the publicity man, and the monied count who marries her. Mankiewicz's flaw is that he only has a few cinematic devices in his movies (here a statue, shoes and rain), and he glues them together with long, complex speeches with allusions that carry through the movie. He wisely hides much of that in the words of these narrators. Its a sign that he understood himself and his craft.

I suppose there's much to say about the conventions of neonoir, but I won't here, except to advise you to look for three things: the trial, the party with the gypsies and the sexually curious boys who seem to be in the background a lot... And how similar they are.

What interests me more is the highly reflective form he's chosen. It is a movie. It is about the movie business. And within that, it is about a woman with a Cinderella -Prince Charming fantasy. There are many, many moments when the script's lines talk about this not being a script or how closely it follows a script. The characters here are drawn from real film life and filmgoers would have recognized most of the main characters.

Both Mankiewicz brothers toyed with self-reference and other folds, but this and the earlier "All About Eve" are the most extreme.

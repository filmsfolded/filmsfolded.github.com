Spoilers herein.

Ms Drew is quite a woman. I don't think she is a great actress, but she is working real hard with what she has, and that can be said of only few actresses. Part of her plan is to create and control her own projects. So we have this kind, consisting of the Cinderella tale, the never been kissed deal, the wedding singer thing and this. She doesn't mind playing plain. She does a good job at being pathetic. Too bad she feels she needs to pay her dues in this way.

There are two formulas that cannot transcend themselves. One is the story about fabulously rich people. The other is about pathetic losers.

One wonders about some of these scripts. With so many self-referential work going on now, it entirely possible that her choice has something to do with her own mistakes.

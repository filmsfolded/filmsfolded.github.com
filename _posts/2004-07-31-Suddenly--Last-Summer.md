Spoilers herein.

Many times a movie just outlives its purpose, that is unless you can keep some sort of  reason for it to exist in the fires of nostalgia. This might have been such a thing. After all, it  deals with 'serious' matters that don't seem so serious these days. And it uses dramatic  conventions that are nearly laughable, at least obsolete.

But it has transcended obsolescence with time to become something of a comment on itself,  which is what I though the writers intended. 

It is set twenty years before its release, long enough before (before the Great War II) to  portray the time as primitive. The sexual and psychological perspectives of the characters  were supposed to be understood by the audience as quaintly outdated. Now with time, we  get to see both the story and the reality behind the story as pathologically engaging.

The story is about what in 58 would be called a flaming queer. It is written (play and  screenplay) by two such. And the only character who is not severely broken (the wise doctor)  is played by yet another flamer!

Clift's character was a renown psychiatrist, but Clift himself was nearly out of his skin by  that time with madness and all that goes with it. Taylor herself had saved his life from a  probable suicide attempt and the rebuilding of his face is apparent. (He would in fact later  succumb to demons and kill himself.)

Now this is what I call 'folding,' where the movie in some fashion becomes about itself,  ideally untrary. 

I believe Williams and Gore intended this: that's why they staged the 'viewing' of the  operation with (nearly) themselves watching. Its why there's such a clever metaphor about  life as poetry. Its why both Taylor and her character are "procurers." Its why the words are so  near and the images (handled by mere mechanics) are inapposite.

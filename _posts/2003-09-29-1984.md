Spoilers herein.

It is a pet peeve of mine to discover films whose point is undermined by its container.  Most of these are the trivial case of movies about taking chances and being unique, but  the form of the movie is the complete opposite.

What we have here is similar, but in an interesting way.

The book is a minor work, poorly written with dim vision that would have long ago faded  away. It is a morality tale that follows in the tradition of 18th century Christian lesson- stories. But it accidentally fell into a niche that is convenient for the US public school  system. That system has to recognize the plain fact that reading is the very first step to a  life of the mind. 

But education is an industrialized affair, so the core of that truth is bleached down to  books that are an easy read, that have no ambiguity or layering, books that have a  "message" that can be clearly stated and about which simple questions can be asked.  1984 meets these criteria, so has been elevated to the status of an "important book." In  fact, 1984 has survived that status in the last decade of creating similar "important  books" whose "message" isn't even in the text, rather the fact that they have "diverse"  authors.

But the "truths" in this book aren't truths at all; they are instead simple slogans. 

Now, along comes a credible movie version of the book, which makes "teaching" even  easier. Students can now glue themselves to a screen like scabs, to coagulate the simple  point on which they can be questioned. How is this substantially different than the  perfidious conditions depicted? 

(There is one difference: the world OF the movie is unrelentingly bleak and sexless. The  movie is as well, but it has nudity, which -- I suppose -- makes a statement about  freedom of some kind to junior high schoolers.)

"Brazil" was a flawed project, but much richer in exploiting the notion that it was all a  reality constructed by the narrator during a session in a related but similarly constructed  world. Why not show complex films? There are many with this same notion: freedom in  sex as a metaphor for freedom of the mind in a political context. Though that gets pretty  tired, there are many film projects that are at least rich in this regard. (My mind snaps to  "The War is Over.") ... or gasp! Have kids read intelligent, layered books?

As a film, it is all a matter of style, that retrotechno look that begins with familiar Nazi  cinema propaganda and extrapolates forward. In this case, the style is copied from Ridley  Scott's "1984" commercial for Apple's Superbowl introduction of the Macintosh. That  little film still reverberates today.

You could, as a viewer, grow this into a film with depth by adding your own backstory to  the Hamilton character and imputing her as the writer and collaborator with Goldstein.

Spoilers herein.

The challenge of life in my mind is sorting out the things that are important from the ones that merely appear important. It is a non-trivial challenge, composing a life of valuable pieces, because so much of popular art is appealing but vapid. Sometimes that appeal is based on appearing non-mainstream but uses all of the mainstream paraphernalia. Sometimes the profundity is advertised loudly, but melts on observation.

What we have here is some visual imagination, a great deal of borrowing, some pretension, and no focus. There is a 'message,' as plain and simple as 19th century Christian skits. And just as unsophisticated.

Gilliam was not the cleverest Pythonista. But even if he were, their humor was in a well-established tradition of being so obvious, it was funny. By being so literal, it passed parody and moved in and out of the ridiculous. We laughed as much at them poking fun at themselves, as them poking fun as at their target. But this all depends on extreme simplicity, rank obviousness.

If you take that same perspective, those same skills and try to say something important, it just comes out childish. No matter how imaginative the sets. These sets do have some mild cleverness in how they poke fun at themselves. But they are lacking in cinematic power because Gilliam doesn't have the cinematic vision to turn them into powerful images. Scott does in 'Bladerunner,' for instance but you see he makes his living by connecting with the viewer through the art of the medium. Gilliam lacks both the skills and commitment, at least on this film. '12 Monkeys' was better.

By now you probably know all the ordinary things about this movie: the story is trite, the characters are ordinary and except for Robin ordinarily acted, and the jokes are extraordinarily clever.

This comment is about an important trend in animation that most commentors miss, the role of dimensionality and how well it is exploited in this movie.

Pixar discovered this. After they made their character's bodies render visually with dimension, and after they gave the identity of the characters "dimension" (still unique to Pixar, it seems), they realized the power of moving them and us around in three-dimensional space. "Nemo" was set in an ocean purely because they wanted to be able to move in all three dimensions without having to make heavy explanations.

The idea gained extra credibility when the "door warehouse" scenes in "Monsters, Inc" tested much better than expected.

Its not like this is a great secret in the industry. Everyone is talking about it now, and the notion goes as far back as "Citizen Kane"'s camera. Others have tried: "Treasure Island" was conceived to maximize the movement of the camera in three--space. So were parts of "Van Helsing" and the latest Potter.

Oddly, some big investments that should have known better didn't, like the Spiderman splats.

This movie does exceedingly well in moving us in three-space. As soon as we enter the city, we have that elaborate transit system. You notice the depth and are intended to. But after that, you take it for granted that you are disembodied and moving freely in threespace. It is a very clever construction, and unusual enough that it makes us accept the world we see. We would merely think of it merely as the Flintstones (or Jetsons) if we saw it with a "normal" eye. 

That movement of the eye allows us to shift realities quickly, so when Robin Williams does a Brittany Spears routine as combat, we accept it.

There's a school of science fiction -- the old school -- that governs how these things are put together. First you take some social injustice or quirk of the times. Then you cast into the future or some fantasy realm with exaggerations in a sort of exploration. In the worst case, its satire. In the very best, say Phil Dick, it can be an open essay on selfawareness.

Then of course, there's the third step, all the elaborations of this fantasy or future world. Again, there's the worst case where they merely amuse and give the general feeling of otherworldliness. And the best case where each detail of the world somehow elaborates on the curlicues of the essay.

What we have here is the worst case in the first two, but done well. We have the kind of obvious, blunt social problem that only an enslaved people would think worthy of elaboration. We have that elaboration similarly bluntly: two races, blind conflict, etc. Its all at the "Animal Farm" level, which is to say the fifth grade. Just recalling it has a dumbing effect.

It is in the third component that this is interesting. Czechs are not strong thinkers when they encounter something directly. They slide in from the side. Its those side things that cut. Even Kafka. His supposedly big ideas, the obvious ones are only a disguise for all the concept fleas he is able to carry on them.

And all those notions are visual here, purely cinematic, which is a joy. In fact, its better to watch this in a different language than you speak. You won't miss anything story-wise and be able to focus on some of the visual notions tried out here.

Not all of them impress of course: for instance there's the bizarre case of the gremlin in a cage that catches birds with its tongue, shakes them dead and discards them. The area is strewn with these corpses, blossomlike while the gremlin giggles. Some guy came to work one day with this idea and nailed it in wherever.

But there are other visual notions that strike. The advanced race indulges in group meditations where manipulative stingers come from the walls of the room and literally mix their bodies. That by itself is pretty strong. Whether group conceptsex or individual, little bubbles or mind-souls drift out of their bodies to the heavens, literally a moon (their "Fantastic Planet") 

There, these mindbubbles join with huge headless robots with the specific purpose of having sex (which is shown as "dancing"). This is also how they reproduce, by mechanisms not explained. The idea is so visual, so rich, so strangely evocative it makes this otherwise dreary thing worth watching.

Apparently it is often paired with "Yellow Submarine" which has none of the fleas.

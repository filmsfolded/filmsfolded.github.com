This is from the early days of talkies and the mad rush to film existing vaudeville acts.

Its a performance of a well known personality doing a well-practiced number -- "Those Were the Days" -- in fewer than ten minutes. What makes it interesting is how a film trick changes the setup. Through the magic of film, we can have the same performer twice on the screen. On the left, she reminisces while her earlier self is one a stage beach on the right. They share singing the song. 

Somewhat clever.

I recently saw the excrescence, "RV," and wondered aloud about it. These things usually don't come randomly, they have history.

The style of physical humor of course is obvious in its provenance, but the wrapper clearly came from a merger of the family vacation genre with this. So I revisited it. I remember seeing it when it was new, in a theater actually. All of us American middlers were in the honeymoon period with TeeVee. It was in the popular imagination roughly where the internet was five years ago: teachers would become obsolete. Maybe reading too.

But what we turned it into was shaped more by Lucy and Ed Sullivan. Its hard to explain now, and always prefaced by apologies and embarrassment, sort of like admitting a vote for Nixon. The premise of "I Love Lucy" was simple and based on silent comedy. Lucy was always striving for some achievement, and when she tried (often by "a plan") she would end up in disaster.

The comedy was in the humiliating situation and how she valiantly plowed through it, coming home at the end to her forgiving husband. It was only a slight modification on Mack Sennet humor: transplanted to a likable domestic woman and designed for repeatability. The formula was Lucy gets an idea; Lucy forms a scheme; the scheme begins and starts to turn against Lucy; the meat of the thing was when things really turn manic and Lucy is in the throes of catastrophe. Its her reactions that make the money. Then Ricky arrives and forgives, with us knowing that she will only repeat the pattern next week.

Perhaps the highlight catastrophe was when Lucy and Ethel work on a candy assembly line and to keep up with the speed have to cram candy into their mouths. The point is that Lucy and Desi had by this time mastered the art of reaching into the past and grabbing things with cinematic power, slightly retreading them with their brand and serving them up.

And that's where this came from. So the question is, why a trailer?

Oh, I guess I should report that the film itself is excruciatingly unfunny except for one too- long bit where Lucy is preparing dinner in the trailer while Desi drives over rough roads. Lucy is knocked about and ends up as self-inflicted foodfight victim.

I think its appearance was a mix of two trends. 

One is the obvious, the fifties fascination with manufactured readiness, of appliances. A leading magazine was "Popular Mechanics" and its sibling "Popular Science" both predicting robots by 1965 (or 75 at the latest) and a life of absolute leisure for all. (Well, white folks, that is.) It was such a prevalent force in society that any humor where the goods humiliated the humans was welcomed.

The other thread is one that really fascinates me. The equating of bigness with technology. We forget it today, because the smaller something is, the more advanced technology it has. But until the time of this movie, thereabouts, the bigger the machine, the more it represented the human advance. Why mention it here? Because all this bigness was wonderfully cinematic. Trains, Ocean Liners, Huge Bombers. Machines that you could enter and that could surround the frame.

That's why this had to be a long, long trailer. It was the cinematic icon of the achievement of domestic appliancedom. 

And look at what the story is. About a third of the story is what we expect: man, woman and machine in a triangular conflict. But fully a third of the story is about the wilderness and the incongruity of all three in a hostile natural world.

Its a cinematic vocabulary that is lost to us now. Even the death star was retro in 1977.

Its a loss. How will we make up the difference? By stuff like the matrix? Alien spaceships?

I'm increasingly aware of two kinds of ordinary narrative. One is simple storytelling. However well done it is, the point is to display a life changed without changing that of the viewer. Another is a powerfully constructed machine designed to fundamentally touch the viewer. It depends both on real shared passion on both sides (maker and viewer) and sharp design.

Projects like this try to bridge the profound gap between them. The story itself is linear and uncomplicated. The camera and method are invisible as usual for these. But the subject is a great artist. You surely know he is by his or her fame and in some cases you will have been touched by that artist outside of the story.

The power of your experience (or what you imagine could be) is inherited -- or hoped to be.

Inetrestingly, I compare this movie to "Nora" and the comparison is striking because the two writers Dylan and Joyce stand rather like the two kinds of movies. Which is most powerful depends on the size of your table, appetite and hunger.

I thought "Nora" was far better because it understood better the notion of body and poetry, sex and powerful writing. Women as the sea, as more than a drink but something you immerse in.

There is an effective scene here directly addressing the embodied poem and the body itself. And then birth and war. Clear, obvious unaffecting.

"Nora" on the other hand had a much deeper scene along these lines that I will never forget. It is simply Nora having breakfast and her robe falling open when it shouldn't matter. Because it is Joyce, it burns.

These Suchet-led adaptations of Poirot are frustratingly uneven because the producers brought in a different creative team for each one. Sometimes they understand the strength of the source material, and other times they go off on some unrelated direction that they graft onto the plot.

They already start with a disadvantage. Suchet produces an entertaining character for sure. But the foibles of Christie's detective were all found to be assets in how he approached a problem. It was almost as if he were from some alien world where people thought differently and so could "see" things we could not.

In this case, he's just a comic man who incidentally solves mysteries as if that were another eccentricity. 

So instead of the puzzle and his attempts to unwind it, we get:

-- a bunch of buffoonery about Poirot's and Japp's eating habits

-- some excessive cinematic nonsense about a mouse who appears through the story

-- in an unrelated insertion, we have the chanting of a nursery rhyme every time something bad is happening

This is the worst of a bad lot. Please avoid it.

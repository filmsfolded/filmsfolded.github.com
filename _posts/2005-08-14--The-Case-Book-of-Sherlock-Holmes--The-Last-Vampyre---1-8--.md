Generally, TeeVee versions of classic literature are disasters. Either they try to stick to what's written which doesn't work because the conventions of the media are so different.

Or they adapt to fit and in doing so forget the elements that made the thing attractive in the first place.

These "Britt Holmeses" have examples of both. This is the latter.

And even as TeeVee fare unconnected to a strong source it stinks. It is turgid and uninteresting in every respect save one. That's the remarkable fire that starts the thing. The fire itself isn't so much, but the building that burns isn't fake and it is a pretty noble place. That part is photographed well; there was no scrimping on this effect.

But other than one of Britt's characteristically dismissive handwaves there isn't a shred of interest here. And certainly no Conan Doyle.

Spoilers herein.

Orson Welles was a visionary mystic who was often coerced into blunt activity by dull men. This is such a case: Orson toeing the line in order to build cash for projects he cared about (at this time, it would have been the amazing 'Othello'). Earlier in his theater career, he did similar slumming in the radio world. He was effective as, say, The Shadow, but not inspired. And when anyone who is so blessed with talent is forced to hide it the project can be called a disaster no matter how apparently palatable it is.

So I can say that this is a crying disaster. I watched it several times looking for the master's subversion. After all, Welles was a stranger in Hollywood, at this point trying to blend in -- literally by marrying a 'local' beauty. He was extremely bright, and all that brilliance was tuned to its own suppression. So one would expected some secret signs distributed throughout that conflate him as actor with his character. Alas, there is not even a spark of that.

The 2 part DVD (with 'The Trial') has a particularly useless commentary.

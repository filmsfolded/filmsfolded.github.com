I saw this with another Stooges short, "The Sitter-Downers." By the late 30's they were trying all sorts of forms. "Sitter" was based on a famous Keaton gag. This is based on the Marx brothers form.

The three take the identities of professors at a girl's school. There's a Margaret Dumaont character, and what you'll see in terms of gags are half Marx and half Stooge.

At the beginning is a pretty sexy shot of one of the young women in a seethrough clingy silk athletic blouse. Postcode adventure I guess. This was Marjorie Deanne who appeared in a couple dozen movies as the designated cheesecake.

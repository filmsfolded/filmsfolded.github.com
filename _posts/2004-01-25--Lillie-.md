Spoilers herein.

TeeVee demands filler, the longer the better, as long as some semblance of a story is  present. This one is just like 'A Woman of Substance:' a redhaired woman survives all  sorts of setbacks to excel in a male dominated world. The hook is her character:  shamelessly sexual and headstrong.

Add some costume texture and you can eat up 9 hours of space.

If you have the stomach for it - or just need to fill time - check out the implicit folding:  this is a film which is superficial (costume) beauty repurposed for TeeVee and is about a  professional beauty who repurposed her status from society hooker to stage celebrity.

Historically what we have is the first such engineering, a template that Hollywood would  adopt with relish. Was Lillie the trailblazer for Clara Bow? Probably.

Spoilers herein.

High school movies fall into three types - at least the ones that work within the genre.  You have the ones that goof on kids from the outside: 'American Pie,' 'Old School,'  'Revenge of the Nerds,' 'Porky's,' even the 'Legally Blond' stuff; those that simply use  character stereotypes to work amusing vignettes: 'Fast Times,' 'Dazed and Confused,'  '200 Cigarettes;' and those that work from the inside.

This latter class has entirely different aims. Instead of goofing, we are intended to get  engaged with the situation. Instead of laughs, we are supposed to be endeared, to see  ourselves. '16 Candles,' 'Ferris BeullerÂ‘s Day,' even 'Circle of Friends' are part of this.  But the differences are subtle: each has that 5 or seven stereotypes: jock, popular girl,  wallflower, nerd and so on.

Each usually features a redheaded girl, because of some power of cinematic projection -  especially in this genre. This particular film is a great example.

It revolves around a guy and a girl, both red. They are meant to exist in a different  reality, close to the viewer. All else is in a different reality: outside, abstract,  stereotypical.

I try to understand 'folding,' where all sorts of contrasts are overlain. This is a great  example of two realities: the one we occupied when we were young (and probably still  do), and the other which is some sort of pretend world that is thrown at us.

Molly Ringwald was able to endear, to capture that space between us and the world of  situation. Lauren Ambrose is very much in the same mold, and is here almost as effective  in parts. There are 20 seconds after she has been kissed which display terrific acting. She  has done nothing as nuanced since. That moment is worth it.

There is also a sequence that starts promisingly with a woman in an angel costume that  in its early stages promises to take this into even more fantastic territory. I think it was  part of idea to feed the fantasy love world of Barry Manilow songs, but the writers lost  the ball - or the scenes were cut by the studio looking for more outside laughs.

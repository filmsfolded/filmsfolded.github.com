Water is cinematically architectural. Disaster films are the summer movie version of noir. Hardly recognizable, but that's the parent. Titanic made some money. So we'll be seeing these for a long time.

I think the best of these was "Alien Resurrection." It had more variety than this: water rising, gotta open that hatch before the water gets us, oh gosh, we got it at the very last second. People with burdened pasts sacrifice themselves honorably.

I suppose it matters to some folks who the characters in distress are. It doesn't to me. What matters is whether I can be inserted into spaces that cinematically sweep. Dynamic architecture, cinematic flow. I was excited about this because Petersen understood cinematic space in "Das Boot." And I heard that he mixed cinematic water with one of those other dynamic materials, fireballs.

But I have to report that this doesn't have that architectural sensibility we need. It is instead a standard action flick that happens to have a large machine. All the collapses look the same. All the fireballs are alike. All the rushing rushes are identical. We get bored fast, after seeing the rather grand ballroom flipping.

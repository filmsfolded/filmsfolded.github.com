Others have remarked on the bad acting, vacuous story and sterile action scenes.

Maybe its my age, but this was worse than a waste, this was a truly offensive film. Demeaning racial stereotypes have never been so seriously presented in recent film (that is: not as satire or camp, nor as necessary part of a true story). I left with a really bad taste in my mouth.

This was the opening weekend and about 3/4 of the audience was African-American. I felt really bad for them, and somewhat wonder where is the outrage?

Stay away. This film is not just bad, it's vile.

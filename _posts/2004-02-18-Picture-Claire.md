Spoilers herein.

The core of noir is not visual, rather the notion of a fate that governs. Real movies posit the  world first, then build the cinematic values to match.

The typical noir has an ordinary person captured in a machine that appears to be intelligently  toying with circumstance. The viewer conspires with this fate: those coincidences would not  occur if we hadn't foisted the poor souls into a movie.

It is a deeply self-referential idea, here emphasized by the hapless victim falling into this  world by being photographed. Juliette Lewis tries to be in intelligent films, and that no doubt  is why she is here. But she just isn't up to the job technically. It takes the ability to place  yourself partly in the world of the film and partly in the space between that world and the  world of the viewer.

At least there is the intent, but it all collapses in the execution.

The problem with Jesus is that we invest all sorts of qualities to the character. There are theological dances you can do with the notions of human and deity and all that. But when you encounter Jesus in a film, the balance is all strewn.

That's because unless you deliberately have a filmmaker that invests in the space around the humans you see, that's all you see. So you get iconography like Mel Gibson's that is simple idolatry. 

And that's why this is so celebrated. Observers explain it by noting that the filmmaker wasn't a believer so avoided the idolatrous excess you see everywhere Jesus appears.

But if you know Pasolini you know his approach is one of rich composition of context. He is a painter with an eye toward composition. When people appear, they aren't fully people in a theatrical sense, they are props with amazing faces.

So if you are hungry for Jesus as many are, this will be handy for you. If you build your own life instead and use cinema as one of your tools, this will also be useful. But the later Pasolini is better.

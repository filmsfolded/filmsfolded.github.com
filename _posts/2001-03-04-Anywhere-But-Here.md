Spoilers herein.

This film got made because they had two boxoffice draws. Since that was the only reason, they played safe with everything else, in particular employing a formulaic script. I can imagine the pitch: 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' meets 'Mermaids' meets 'Terms of Endearment,' (which is mentioned in the action) but without the edge of any.

Wang does not equal Woo + Ang; everything is rote with him here, and too much. He focuses on faces, which is fine with these faces, but forgets the rest of the world. What's up? His last film was the exciting 'Chinese Box.' Complex. Nuanced, Environmental. Guess he got burned on that project so decided to go plain.

Sarandon seems distracted here, and I suppose it is because the character isn't very real. Her acting style is old school method, where you have to find the real person and then let her behave. There is no real person here, only a series of neurotic episodes.

Which brings us to Portman. She is an emotional prodigy. Was just right in 'The Professional,' and really shined in 'Beautiful Girls,' which was her best. (Funny, it was Uma Thurman's best too.) But since then, she has been stymied by a reserve. She is smart enough to look like she is a fine actor, without committing her soul. This still places her high on the roster, but well below say Kate Winslet or Cate Capshaw. 

This film and the Walmart mom bit that followed were disappointing in terms of the growing maturity we expect. The 'Star Wars' episodes could further mar her skills, with all that distracting bumf.

Thora Birch has an uncredited small role here, where she outacts Natalie! Just because she was there and not thinking but acting. Thora was making 'American Beauty' at this time I think, which is roughly the same story with several enriching folds and a more cinematic vision.

Shawn Hatosy also has a small role. He is someone to watch, to judge not from the vapid 'Providence' but from the pretty engaging 'Sympatico.'

Pretty bad when everyone involved in a project has very much better work elsewhere.

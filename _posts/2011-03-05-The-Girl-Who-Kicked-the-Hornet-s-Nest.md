I found this trilogy a drudge, getting more tedious in the later chapters.

Yes, it is another all-powerful conspiracy story with a dogged detective who triumphs. The only attraction I can see is the border that is straddled here. Our girl is alternately powerful and vulnerable, in control and controlled, all-seeing (in the way movies like to portray hackers) and in the dark.

I do understand the appeal. It doesn't take much for the public to embrace a character, but a character does not make a story. 

When watching this, all I could think was how Fincher will handle the material. The man is a master storyteller; holy cow he took one of the least interesting people on the planet and made a good film, right? My guess is that he will downplay the action and much of the threat on Millennium and simply handle it the way Hitchcock would: by showing us more than the investigators know but less than we need to understand what is going on.

It will be Bloomqvist's quest rather than the girl's release. It will introduce sexual tension in the story as a matter of trust in the relevant narrative. Yes, I can almost savor Fincher through this merely through the anticipation.

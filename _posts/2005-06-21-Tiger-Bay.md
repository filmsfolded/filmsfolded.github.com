There's a class of movie that instead of transporting us to another world, it keeps us in the same world, but introduces a person not of this world. The most common of these concern innocent children, usually in the face of some dirty element of the world.

One wonders what the value of these are, and why they keep being made. ("Sixth Sense" twisted the formula a bit.)

I haven't yet settled this matter in my mind. But if you have, you may find this small project one of the best -- that is to say that the projected innocence of the child is extreme and endearing. John Mills follows the theatrical adage of never passing up an opportunity, and it is his daughter that is highlighted here,

Unfortunately for us, the world isn't very threatening, in fact the other kids (and perhaps a priest) are the meanest things we see. The cop (played by the dad) is a good, patient man. The killer is too.

When you put together your private film school syllabus, you may want to include the scene where she recounts the murder to the police. Discard the rest.

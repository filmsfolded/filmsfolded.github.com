Spoilers herein.

I didn't expect a good film, but I did expect a good story, and with detective fiction that's good enough. But you have to play fair. You have to tease the audience into trying to figure out what the hell is going on. 'Playing fair' means that when a surprise occurs, you recall all the clues that you've seen that should have told you what was just revealed. It gives you encouragement to be cocreator of the narrative. 

Once this trust is broken, you just don't try, and the whole thing turns out bad. Your mind wanders. For instance, you notice Monica's (surgically?) exaggerated nose and how it's strong upsweep complements Morgan's, perhaps exactly if turned upside down. When you reach this stage, you've lost everything.

Nothing in this film plays fair. Worse, there is scant detection, limited to 1) noticing a disconnect in a dialog with the bad guy, but this dialog is itself so artificial that everything in it is a disconnect and 2) guessing a password which even if known could have been spelled a dozen different ways.

Freeman does his patented wise cop thing, and we forgive his lazy acting because he is has such an avuncular calm.

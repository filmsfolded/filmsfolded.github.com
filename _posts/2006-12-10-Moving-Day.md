Walt Disney was famous for his fascination with butt jokes. We see it here. This cartoon has two extended jokes. One is a tussle between Goofy and an animated piano. Its among the best bits in early animation.

The other, longer piece was surely scripted by Walt. It has Donald in all sorts of butt-problem situations. Its more curious than funny. Where do jokes about rear ends come from? Donald was created pretty much for this purpose and most of his projects concern rear ends until Walt became obsessed with Disneyland and trains.

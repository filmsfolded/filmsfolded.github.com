Spoilers herein.

If you believe in the power of drama and you are a filmmaker, you have two challenges: to find an engaging drama and to devise a cinematic expression. Cox solves the first handily: this notion of death forcing the imagination behind love is powerful, unsettling and rarely explored. The players do a capable enough job getting attuned to the dramatic possibilities.

But in finding the cinematic expression, Cox has some difficulties. In fact, for me, this was much better played as sound only. I often run this test, or the reverse: images only.

The cinematic solution is to show the current love in terms of recalled images. Some of those are lovely: the hazy romance of the engaging, photogenic Kirstien Van Pellicom. Some are the more nightmarish visions of the wife in the grave. The bridge between this imaginative film-world and the 'real' world is Andreas watching the disinterment of his wife: a highly stylized Yorick-derived episode. One can see how much effort was put into solving this problem. But for me, it all rests on an assumption that doesn't work. 

One of the stressed points is that love matures, that the tendernesses become deeper, that the appreciation of shared needs is more attuned to the pattern of life. But all the 'enriching' visuals we get are of the young couple: grappling in lust. We are meant to gloss over the dissonance between the callow and mature, to appreciate as explanation what the explanation tells us is not so. The final problem comes in the scene at the church. The buildup to that point is in he visual imagination. Why then is the sensory overload purely auditory? Why, if all this effort went into convincing us that visual histories have power, why then not have the fatal saturation be one that is of the visual world? I am thinking of 'Wings of the Dove.'

Cox is too knowledgeable to have not seen the problem, which is a matter of us not having (after 75 years!) an accessible enough vocabulary of visual sense to draw upon. Tarkovsky has one, but it is not available to the larger audience Cox seeks. So he relies instead on the natural tendency of audiences to merge all things romantic into one tarball in the memory. Its harmful stuff, feeding that urge. But if you agree to it, rosey images of Kirstien isn't bad material to shove in there.

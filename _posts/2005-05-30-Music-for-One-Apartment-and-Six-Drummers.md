Swedes are the most orderly people on the planet. Their sense of propriety is something that this American can only wonder about. That's why this little film escapes me.

The whole point of this is that the six folks who break in are not odd-looking, but quite ordinary and respectable looking. All the objects, even the objects in the bedroom are the most ordinary. The music itself is ordinary. The edge of the film is the confluence of these three ordinary elements: ordinary people where they don't belong, making music of things not so intended.

If you are not one who obsesses about order, then this will not have any resonance and will look like what it is, a student film.

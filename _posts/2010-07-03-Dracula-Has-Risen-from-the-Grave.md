Hammer is remembered fondly for maintaining a genre during some lean times, and thereby keeping a whole cosmology alive in the collective imagination. These bloodlust ideas were perfectly formed when Bram Stoker crafted them, but it wasn't until about a hundred years later that they started to penetrate into the imaginations of teenagers in novel ways. Hammer carried the water, preserving the original vision more or less until it caught fire.

It is easy to see this movie having value in that way... being the corpse that survives to pass on the curse. Supposing that genres are important and this particular one as well, then this movie is important in a background, heartpump sort of way.

Otherwise, wow, so bad. It does nurture a few of the elements that were added to the original world: the necessity of having a redheaded, sexy concubine and the extreme importance of the symbol of the cross.

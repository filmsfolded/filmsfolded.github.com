Spoilers herein.

I liked this little amusement in spite of myself.

Superficially, it is an ordinary project, handled moderately well. Perhaps the strongest  thing to be said for it is that it steadily dissolves into madness. Or at least the characters  do. I prefer it when the manner of telling the story becomes equally mad. There are lots  of examples of this, but the one I saw with this film was 'Videodrome.'

Nevertheless, the attraction of this for me is Jennifer. She is a peculiar, interesting  actress. Ms Leigh seems to carry her own audience with her, and it is this to which she  presents her character. It is an unsettling thing to watch, and very effective when  exploited.

I'm not sure who is the mind behind how she is used here; I suspect it is wholly her  doing as the director seems pretty unaware of the effect.

Here's what happens. The character Hedy carries her own twin within her. It is to that  twin that she relates in all matters of her life. In the past and here, she embosses that  internal being on an external one, Allie. The story revolves around the dissonance  between what she expects and what she gets.

And so with the acting. Jennifer carries around her own audience to which she directs all  her character's devices. When she acts in a film, she embosses that internality on us, the  external watchers. The joy of seeing her is in the dissonance between the two.

This is amplified -- at least for me since my study of redheads in film -- by her  embossing the projection back on herself. In the story this is her becoming Allie who has  become her sister. In our film experience, it is her joining us in watching her.

She isn't a particularly powerful actress. But she knows how to use what she has and is  always interesting. Good for us.

Spoilers herein.

There are lots of self-referential or reflexive films. That's where the act of making the film is acknowledged in the film itself. A common model is the where a photographer acts as detective and something discovered in HIS film reflects onto OUR film. 'Blowup' is the classic example with 'Femme Fatale' a more recent twist. Scheider probably understands this. Director Frank Pierce surely does. This is the guy that gave us one of the best reflexive projects: 'Dog Day Afternoon,' as well as 'Cool Hand Luke' and 'Cat Ballou.' No dummy this guy, and though this is an incredibly stupid story - as all TeeVee projects must be - there's some cool reflection here.

The story resembles 'True Crime' and 'The Player,' both similarly reflexive, more than 'Dead Man Walking' or 'Dancer in the Dark.' The execution isn't the point, only an excuse for the photographer to have his lens make the story. His Pulitzer was won, we are told, by a similar event. Along the way, we get some not bad shine on well-worn stereotypes: the floozy wife, the two-faced cop, the conniving DA, the small-town police clerk, the pushy reporter. The one minor twist is that this inmate thinks he was guilty and is not saved.

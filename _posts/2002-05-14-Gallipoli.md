Spoilers herein.

I viewed this because I have a growing respect for Australian film talent. This is a nation whose icon is a house for the performing arts; who produced three of the five most talented working film actresses. Although they produce film actors as well, and popular ones, they have less to offer. But out of Australia came one of the boldest commercial films ever, 'Moulin Rouge!.' and the serviceable blockbuster 'Lord of the Rings' came out of neighboring New Zealand. In fact between the two, we have a couple of the top woman directors.

And this film. This film which is considered the most important of Australian films. And I was disappointed. The story concerns a purely Australian matter. One should probably say a Western Australian matter, concerning that region that most defines the perceived national character: pluck, boldness, impetuousness, loyalty, sass, rugged athleticism, international reach. All these characteristics are marched out, together with more universal goodnesses (mates, family, good sportsmanship and so on). Unlike the US, Australia never weaned itself from the anachronisms of imperial Britain, so they define themselves as a curious mix of acceptance and rejection of the 'mother.'

All this was quaint. And the production was solid enough. But it had no discernible non-Hollywood philosophy or even style. 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,' 'Piano' and 'Oscar and Lucinda' all had a uniqueness that expressed both the environment and its reflection in the filmmaker. But all the notions for this film were imported. Worse, when watching you get the feeling you have seen every element of this before: here is 'Lawrence,' here 'Chariots,' here 'Western Front' and on and on as if this was assembled from overseas parts to make an Australian doll.

Of mild note is to see Mel Gibson when he cared. Still the same two mannerisms, but at least here with commitment.

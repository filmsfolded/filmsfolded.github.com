For decades I feared this film. "Marianbad" and "Hiroshima" so profoundly affected me that I worried that if I encountered something from this man that couldn't be squirreled as fiction, I might never recover. Artists can move your soul if you live, and our imperative is to live, and thus be vulnerable.

But I have this crazy film project where I wish to view all the important films ever made and say something intelligent in an online book. So I steeled and marched into this. 

And I was surprised at how ordinary it is as a film. Don't get me wrong. Its effective and powerful because the Germans were as they were and they made what horrible things they made, with the willing help of many non-Germans, including the famous French policeman shown here whose nationality was obscured by embarrassed French funders.

But its horrible because the matter is horrible, not because the film is particularly well sculpted. The most effective footage is stuff I have seen elsewhere. Its footage taken by Eisenhower's army reporters because he knew there would be crazies that would deny the thing. The reality of it shakes you to the bones, even if you've seen it many times.

Is it because the score and the "present" pictures of overgrown camps seems so tranquil, so ordinary? Is it because the narration is so relentless?

Its not as I feared, and I suppose that's a good thing. There couldn't be any way for Resnais to magnify it.

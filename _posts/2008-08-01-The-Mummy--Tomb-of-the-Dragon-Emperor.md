Of course you can read from others how horrible this is. But you know, we forgive an awful lot if the thing thrills us in the action scenes.

I think just a little bit of clever editing could have saved this film in the popular imagination. And I'll bet that some film student does so. Here's the problem: you have to give the viewer enough disorienting information, usually motion of some kind, to feel unusual. Its a cognitive process thing and most filmmakers do it intuitively. But at the same time you have to give enough information so that the viewer can understand the situation. 

This means that you have to locate the key elements and people at least when the situation might have changed. These things are often contradictory, except in very familiar situations. Its why car chases are common, say since "Bullit" because the constraints make it easy to register situations. Its a balancing act and wen its on that edge (which changes over time) it can make action sequences thrilling.

Its a different sort of balance in a mass battle and individual combat than a chase. But the principle is the same. Watch the martial arts styles -- and what is captured of every move in a well made film, like say "Crouching Tiger," to see what I mean. In those cases, the editing is helped by the physical move and the conventions we have for capturing the move to allow the editor to find that edge.

Alas, it isn't here. It looks like they may have re-edited this thing in a hurry, particularly the chase near the beginning with a mummy chariot/hearse and a shanghaied fireworks truck. Great idea, simply poor editing.

Gosh I miss Steven Sommers. I may have been the only one who thought "Van Helsing" was great in these sorts of cinematic values -- and others.

So its a huge yawner, because it can't place itself in any groove. There is only one mildly interesting thing. I saw the same deal last week in the climax of "Hellboy 2." Its this notion of a reanimated army being controlled by this set of ancient cogs, part of a magical/mechanical machine. In Hellboy's case it was more clock-like. Here it has a sort of human-manipulatable orrery. 

The surrounding gears are too hokey for words, but they had a clever designer put together the rotating globe and bands, and the circling spheres that the "mummy" conjured as handles for the netherworld. So there IS about 20 seconds of interest here.

Sadly, Maria Bello is handled so poorly, her normally effective presence is just simply repellent.

Spoilers herein.

I think there are a few well defined types of film. You can enter a film for various  reasons, and one type is there to provide you with a template of what you would like to  be like. You go to these films not so much for an experience, but an anti-experience;  you want to identify in a way that reinforces your identity.

If the movie is too ambitious, or too much work to watch, you cannot feel superior  enough to adopt it as the brand that you belong to. Naturally, kids are one target for this  sort of thing, but they are not alone: check out nearly all sports films, most 'date'  movies, and of course traditional porn.

These movies always have 'good parts,' where you get the brand, and deliberately bad  filler that you can guffaw over and generally feel superior about. Its all about branding  and brand acceptance.

In this case, whether you like this is a matter of whether you by the brand, because this  dance style is as authentic as urban sports attire.

But you already knew that.

I'll go to ANY dance movie. That's because since 'Red Shoes' the dancing eye of the  camera has been part of the engagement with the dancers. The very best such films use  a camera that is a coherent part of the dance. 'Dogtown' did this, if you'll allow me to  say that skating is urban dance.

So I was eager to see how this fellow waterbug handled it - he is supposed to be  'genuine' himself. Urban music is overtly unsophisticated, regular in 4/4 rhythm and  mundane in harmonics. Its appeal - like the porn brand - is the rest, where energy and  local in** (very local to the beat, what musicians call rubato) give us appeal.

The camera does two things: switch between high and low (knee level), and do so more  or less to the beat. Two cameras are used on all the dances except the last where four  are present. I was pretty disappointed because there really is an art to hiphop and there  are cinematic tools Stokes could have used: rhythm in the camera, time shifts (like the  back and forth or turntable scratching), emphasis on body parts other than faces and  knees. 

None of this. So it stabs the brand in the back. Stokes is off with his phone turned down  when the brothers really needed him to be there.

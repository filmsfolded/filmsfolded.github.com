Spoilers herein.

I seem to be swimming in another direction from many of my friends. I really liked this,  and incidentally both 'Blair Witch' projects. They incorporated neat ideas about film  (regardless of whether they were consciously intended) which worked.

In this case the idea is straight out of Godard. The most effective films are those in which  live is 'real,' where the dramatic shaping and emphases are non-existent. Or if they  exist, they are discovered within life.

Horror films are very much dramatized. Every element of the logic that drives the story,  every event, everything we see is done so that the camera can know what is happening.  These people don't exist in a 360degree universe, only in a 15 degree one so that we can  see them. There isn't spontaneous, overlapping conversation, but carefully parceled,  clear dialog so that we can understand. 

Your typical horror film spins a logic that taps our inner superstitions; then it displays the  fantastic results of that superstitious fear for us to experience. The art in the ordinary  tingler is in stretching out and clarifying the horror. We must _see_ it, every detail, or  imagine it via standard dramatic devices as it happens off stage.

So what I liked about this is that the events did not bend to the camera. The first death  was a bonk on the head, and 2 seconds later, we're on to the next event. No voyeurism  because as if by bad luck the camera wasn't in a good spot to gouge into the details. It  just happened. (We don't even see what happened to the girl on the hook. Imagine that  occurring in your typical Jason epic.)

And so do all the others, until that scene with the old man and the hammer that falls out  of his hand. Now _that_ was dramatically sculpted, was unreal, had our surrogate eye  right where it belonged. And that's why it was so effective.

I watch a lot of pretty bad contemporary movies, partly because I want to be there when something new happens. I think I see this in films today, the emergence of new elements of the cinematic grammar. Its one of the biggest thrills in life to be there when a new way to dream appears.

This would have been such an experience for someone watching this movie seventy or so years ago. Its quite an invention, you know to show an inner monologue. 

One of the most interesting things in a life of film is considering it as a full narrative medium. Its tough, you know. When this film was made, we still read books; literature was vital. We were still inventing narrative devices in the written word. We had a few thousand years of working with the written story and perhaps a half a million with spoken stories. They had all that time to integrate with and lead the way we imagine, the courses of concepts.

One problem they solved and perhaps invented was the notion of inner dialogue. Since this film was made, we have developed a rich vocabulary of narrative layering. I'm determined to understand it because I am engaged in an effort to make machines who understand this.

But if you are interested in history, this is important. It incidentally isn't too bad, in a now naive sort of way.

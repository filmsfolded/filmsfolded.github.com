Spoilers herein.

This is an amazing film to see in these times.

A film is a work which is (almost always) under the control of one man, surrounded by his tongueless priests. It involves many, many people. What is left at the end is an immutable work of art that carries the memory of that man and his collaborators into the future. The film life IS the afterlife. And for as long as there are humans, someone will continue to bring these visions back to life by experiencing them. Our experience as gods in this afterlife.

Much treasure was locked into this project -- and we can see it all. Unfortunately, we as gods of the future have a perspective that the humble humans who made this do not. And as a group, we see someone who didn't even listen to what was happening around him.

The cinerama format is exploited so far as filling the frame. But it is lifeless. The camera seldom moves like Welles' does. There are masses of people, but no sweep of motion like Kurosawa's. There is acting of sorts, but it is the pretend variety, not visceral like Brando's. While the world of the craftsmen was reinventing the universe, the pharaohs of Hollywood plodded on unblinkingly. Those craftsmen, many of them, trudged off across the desert -- and a good thing for us.

Spoilers herein.

The book played with narrative: the narrator accepted bad things happening to her because she wanted them. It was an experience that is missed here.

Weaver isn't quite up to this. She tries valiantly, but the director gives her no help. he doesn't understand what made the book work. Straithorn does well in spite of it all. 

But the real gem here is Julianne Moore. I'll follow her into any theater. She makes a great film here in the background when the director isn't watching.

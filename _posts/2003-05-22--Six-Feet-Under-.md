Spoilers herein.

How sad it must be to write for TeeVee. Of all the forms possible, you MUST focus on defining characters which is the lowest form of drama, and the riskiest. Everything depends on faces. You MUST run a couple slight storylines, all necessarily easy to grasp, which means they must lack any depth. Most of these must arc to a satisfactory, simple platitude at the end of the hour. This is attempted thousands of times a year, and it is thin praise when someone succeeds as they do here. But there is no cause for celebration.

For cinematic imagination, TeeVee can be depressing, even damaging. I ventured into this world because I was attracted by Lauren Ambrose and I could watch on DVD without being accosted by relentless, intrusive carpet salesmen. I'm particularly interested in how redheads are used in film, and since TeeVee creates and uses stereotypes exclusively I thought I'd check her out. My interest is heightened when the redhead is less talented than the competition.

Lauren here plays the Tuesday role with the puffed face and deliberate slovenliness of many teens. Her apparent inadequacies as an actress map well to most teens' inability to fill whatever role they've selected. But otherwise this is a complete waste of time. Go to 'Twin Peaks' instead. At least that is clever and subversive.

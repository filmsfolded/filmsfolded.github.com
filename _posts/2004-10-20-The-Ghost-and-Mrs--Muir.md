Spoilers herein.

The Mankiewicz brothers helped elevate film. This is not considered a particularly intelligent work, but it seems so to me. At least the notion of the untrusted narrator is. 

The story is presented as if it were true, as if there really was a ghost. But the point of view of the camera and subtle twists of direction leave the question of reality open. Perhaps much of what you see, even the existence of the daughter, is 'made up.' The Ghost is made up for the Book, and the Daughter (she of Dead Eye Dick) for the Movie.

An example of the subtle wedge: her lying lover is a children's writer.

I think I liked this story better in its 'Rumor of Angels' and 'Might be Giants' incarnations.

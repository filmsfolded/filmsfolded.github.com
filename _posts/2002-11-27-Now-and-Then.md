Spoilers herein.

Melanie Griffith as an actress; Demi Moore as a writer!  As adults, they come to 'investigate and present' and the framed flashback begins. What follows is a series of episodes intended to charm. Not much more, folks. Its a stock piece of cleverness, but the question is: do they charm?

Not this viewer. But its not from trying everything, from budding boobs, to the sewer adventure, to the cemetery mystery to the revenge on the wormers. There's more contrived cuteness in this than even the Eloise books would attempt. I admit a fascination with the careers of young actresses. That metamovie is undeniably compelling, especially when you deal with the whole class of girls who might have talent, who probably miss out on 'real' life, who may fall into a pit of drugs, exploitive sex, firehosed flattery, and eating disorders. And who may come through on the other side as someone who might change our lives with their art. 

Melanie, Demi and cohorts are failures in this regard. Which of these girls might survive? None of them connected here, but I'll watch any movie with Garofalo or Davidovich.

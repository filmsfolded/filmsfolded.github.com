Spoilers herein.

Jane would be saddened to see what has been done to her "Emma." Emma was deeply selfish and exploited an entrenched social structure. Cher is lovably daft and surfs capricious fads -- the story just does not transport.

Alicia does well enough for a career start. But then see her in Branagh's experiment and one can see that there's not much growth.

I prepared for this by reseeing 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' which at least had Sean Penn. Here you can amuse yourself by watching Wallace Shawn. But not much else.

Pedro is always a deep experience for me. I consider his "Talk to Her" a life-altering experience, and eagerly await every visit to his table. Its always a personal experience for us both. Its always highly cinematic both in the way he uses the vocabulary and how he references other films. Its always folded in some clever, unique way.

But not all shared meals with him are nourishing. Some films sacrifice composition for emotional immediacy and the other way around. The way its supposed to work is that one reinforces the other. Medem can do this, but my friend Pedro likes ambiguity and tension in all things he can reach, so he performs a commiserotomy and tilts these things.

In terms of emotional touch, the dynamic is simple. All the joy in how this unfolds is in how it is folded in the first place. We have at least three films, each of which is explicitly or implicitly in one other, each written and writing. We have always two actors and sometimes two names per character. Some characters wear identity costumes in a folded persona. Much of the tension that builds between the two protagonists depends on crossworld, crossfilm tensions, always shown, never explained.

But at the end, I wasn't touched. I wasn't transformed. I wasn't even impressed because the matter didn't matter to me. It may be because I do not appreciate the depth of insult to the Spanish male ego. It surely is partially because I do not carry a continual angst about the Catholic-fascist collaboration which bled into Pedro's formative years. It may be because the sexual tension was too abstract for this monosexual.

It surely is the most elaborately constructed of the projects I know, and on that score -- because he raises the bar all around -- this is another must see.

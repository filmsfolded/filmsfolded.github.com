Spoilers herein

The other half claim that the world is divided into two types of people. Depending on your vocabulary these are neurotics and psychotics; heads and hearts; numeralists and geometers; fatalists and cocreators and so on. Whatever terms you like to use, Gould is in the first of these, and that reflects his approach to music. Bach is also.

Bach's music is highly mathematical, almost mechanically so. Stripped of emotion, it is pure in an abstract, cosmic sense. Gould's approach to music (and life -- not an incidental overlap) is neurotic, highly charged, anticipative, brilliantly logical, nimble. This mix -- together with a relatively more common virtuosity with the instrument -- makes Gould the best performer of Bach we have. His animation of the mathematics is always ahead of our own perception, so it makes the mathematics seem more alive. Not real life, but the kind of life we see in animated spheres.

Contrast this with another world entirely, say Rubenstein (or Argerich!) and Chopin. This music is human, rooted not in some abstract aether, but in the soul. It is not clever, but real. It is not golden, but tearful, sweaty. It deals not with celestial mechanics, but with yearnings. Not with precision but with hesitations and local attractions. Not with planetary gravity but the emotional kind.

Myself, I consider the latter to be true music, the life-altering kind. The former is brilliant decoration, also perhaps interesting technically. And that's the problem with this film: it emulates the Bach notion of little snapshot explorations. Each one is crafted to be technically brilliant; each one has some conceptual relationship with its neighbors. The sum triangulate the matter, giving a totality of external but abstract and distant probes.

But the method lacks soul, and the subject here does too. We are intrigued by his eccentricities, but never invest in his being, because he doesn't have one in the musical sense. He has washed it away.

For myself, I have to relegate this film to the huge stack of failed attempts to give us a film about music that has the same power, and type of power, as that music. It may be too hard an endeavor, but in this case the enterprise fails because the subject is in the wrong half of humanity.

Spoilers herein.

I'm a recent convert to Hartley's World. And I think he may be only a tentative convert  himself.

Superficially, he focuses our attention on abstract reductionism in storytelling. Not  unsurprisingly, that focuses our attention on the story. This allows him to add more and  more explicit metatext which is similarly clarified. The relationship and integration of  this stuff is more simply and directly integrated in the story as well: representation and  reality; naming and meaning; reflex and deliberation.

The effectiveness of this is breathtaking. If he actually had something to SAY, this could  be a lifealtering experience. I call this the "Fight Club" effect. Like Jimi Hendrix, he  distracts us, opens a pipe deep into our soul, and then pours in the same vacuous truths  he reacts and preaches against.

Fortunately, he grew sufficiently to satisfy me by ?One True Thing.? He might turn out to  be important. Certainly his cinematic intuitions are very sharp. Watch this for a deep  understanding of rhythm, and not just the ordinary rhythm of pacing, but in the  integrated visual poetry of punctuated attitude.

Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4: Worth watching.

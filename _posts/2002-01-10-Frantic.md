Spoilers herein.

I appreciate good filmmakers, and Polanski is a good filmmaker. To my mind, that has little to do with entertainment and all to do with having a specific vision and the ability to make it happen -- to locate that vision in some place that transports us in either terms of the world revealed, or in some metaperspective. In 'Ninth Gate,' Polanski was concerned with the latter. But here, he wants to create something on the screen, not in the mind.

Like many before him (perhaps only de Palma matters), he is building on Hitchcock. Since we are so familiar with Hitch's visual grammar. it is an instant platform to build on. The funny thing is that Polanski is interested in the small visual tricks from Hitch, but we usually think of Hitchcock films in terms of specific story elements.

So Polanski obliges by dragging up a plot with the right elements: ordinary man thrust by chance into dangerous happenings beyond his control. He even gives us Ford, who is so dumb about the essence of filmmaking he himself is caught up in dangerous happenings beyond his control. This could only have been deliberate. But all that is to make it easy for us to place Hitch's vision under this film as a platform.

At the end of Hitchcock's career, he was repeating himself, so he went (back) to London to give his picture a new feel. The result, 'Frenzy,' had only limited success in deeply conveying the novel sense of place it was supposed to. It's hard, but Polanski takes the challenge here. This is not just a French film, it is what Hitchcock might have done if he were better about the notion of place. And it is not just French, but uniquely Parisian.

It moves more slowly than the Hitch pattern by design: things are ruminated over; they are visually delegated; they are 'documented' (invested in artifacts, here objects). The greater dynamics are ascribed to Jewish conspiracies, or at least conspiracies involving Jews. The eye is often placed at groin level. There is lots of trash and misdirection (especially in the lighting). The American woman is homely, the Parisian enchanting. All this is carefully evocative of the place and Hugoesque.

Spielberg would study and copy the mechanics of this film for similar tricks in the building of 'Schindler's List.' That film used these devices to convey a sense of oily unction in Eastern European suaveness. See the first few scenes of that and then come back to this.

I have a side study of filmmakers who involve their wives in their projects. It is a fascinating study. (Wells, Mamet, de Palma...) Polanski knows more what it means to project womanliness than nearly anyone in film that matters. For him to handle his wife so, shows a particularly challenging tenderness.

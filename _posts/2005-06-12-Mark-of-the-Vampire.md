Sometimes a genre overripens then gets reborn with a new fold. Such was the case with the recent "Shadow of the Vampire," which I thought was one of the most intelligent movies of 2000. It features two layers: the actual reality of the vampire and a "new" layer showing the overarching film reality. Naturally, one bleeds into and drives the other. 

That's not quite what have with this, 65 years earlier and surely embedded in the genesis of the genre. But this is close, so close.

Tod Browning is surely one of the filmmakers worth watching. In this edition, he already stretches the bizarre world he lives in, one of freaks and madmen. This time, his mad scientist is a surrogate of himself, part obsessed and part creator of the world of obsession.

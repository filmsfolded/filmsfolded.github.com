Spoilers herein.

Hollywood is confused. They do well with formulas, but at least some of the public wants quirky black humor. Problem is: such humor is fragile. It depends on risk, on a sensitive touch, on completely sympatico actors, perhaps on experience, but never on formula. No one can really predict when these things will work. So the Hollywood response is take cheap chances. A hit makes up for a dozen failures.

That's why this got made. Who knew? Nobody, but the hedge here was to get some pretty good talent, or at least talent by Hollywood standards.

For me, there are two kinds of success -- whether it works for me in my own wilderness of imagination, and whether the general public likes it. In the latter case, you can get enjoyment even out of a bad movie knowing its center is in the popular world. This film failed on both fronts.

So undeterred, I watched it again, but with a different focus. I often can get great fun out of a bad film this way. (See my comment on 'Billy Eliot.') In this case, your eye wants to go to deVito because he's really such a relatively commanding actor. Or to Midler, because that's where the director wants you to gaze, and she's such a loudmouth.

But if you narrow your focus to Rona and forget all the lessor distractions. 'Downing Rona the Messmarker' (instead of 'Drowning Mona the Dressmaker') is a very bizarre movie. All of the other characters are just dumb, But she is is darkly weird, she lives in a very strange world, much different than the general tone of the film. This works. You almost believe that Jamie's life could really be like that, especially the way she allows herself to look here.

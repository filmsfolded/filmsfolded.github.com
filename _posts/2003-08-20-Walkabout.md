Spoilers herein.

Roeg wave of angst. A great many films are incompetent, so I have my own private  parade when I run across one that has a coherent vision and the skill or artistry to make  that vision real. This is such. At the end of my parade starts the encounter group I have  with my different selves over whether to accept that vision, to enter and inhabit that  world.

Many of my selves are attracted to Roeg's world. This is a film about the problems of  film, about peering into a different world using pure vision. Good. And he uses an all- too-common mode for representing such engagement: sexual attraction. Self-awareness  as sexual awareness, and that self-awareness of the character folded into the self- awareness of the viewer and his/her position as distant.

Parts of me point out the novel slant on this: interesting plots that are artificially twisted  around this notion of separate worlds peering at each other. Other parts celebrate the  amazing efficiency and richness of the visual grammar.

Where I have problems is the reduction of the grand universe of engagement to the  limited playground of sexual obsession. Here and in "Man Who Fell" we have this conceit.  When I saw this in 71, I thought it was a cool conflation, because I was part of a whole  social movement that made the same mapping. 

Thirty years later that seems thin, even dangerously, addictively sophomoric. 

You, dear viewer, may not have the same legacy and need to so aggressively reject this  mapping. It may be simply a convenient narrative device. In which case, this will be a fine  experience for you.

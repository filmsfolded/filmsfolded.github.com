This is not the kind of thing that attracts me: simple drama. Straight ahead, grinding humanity.

Why would people invest in watching something like this? For engagement, I suppose.

There's engagement in the story, for sure, if you need it. But there is a higher level of engagement in knowing that these players are pouring out their hearts for us.

Sarah Polley is extraordinary, just extraordinary. Olympia has a grace that matters. Parker is less open than usual until the end.

Coming to the event, the man's sister and mother talk about Shirley McLain's performance in "Tears of Endearment." The whole movie revolves around that line, that notion.

The thing is constructed so that there is a movie within the movie -- a movie of the event. Something clever.

Here's a rather amazing fold. Its a depiction of the state of woman, circumnavigated by several loosely connected stories of women.

Each is helpless. Each is restricted, with no knives to escape. But each is played by a real person, and what we see are the real people, each woman so strong they might bend whole buildings as they walk by. These are women with tolls, with knives, with lives and introspective determination -- at least compared to the rest of us. We call this "performance."

So in a story where we are presumably are intended to have helplessness seep into our souls, we have just the opposite: celebratory fireworks. It works against itself. It needs to be, for example, "The Last Movie:" a story about movie failure made by the man within. It fails and thus succeeds.

But there's another structural problem. It is entirely possible to construct a composite story, especially when playing with angles that (only seem to) define the role of women Garcia can. PT Anderson can. Altman could. But to do this, you can't just show postcards or tornado damage, you have to make a story. And to do that there has to be a matter of causality. We have to see what is happening to internalize it. Stories that seem to matter get into you not by merely showing damage, but (for example) by seducing you to follow a path that you willingly endorse that leads to damage.

Catherine Breillat can do this sometimes. Jane Campion. Tilda Swinton seems to attract projects along these lines that often work for me.

Not here, I'm afraid. Its a shame, a shame that this movie is so damaged.

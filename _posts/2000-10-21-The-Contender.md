How lucky we are to have so many competent filmmakers working today. This film is above all competent.

Acting. The first thing one notices is the acting, which is at a generally high level. The writing and excessive closeups makes this easier of course, but one still appreciates it. Bridges particularly impressed me.

Pacing. Much more impressive is the pacing. Pulling off a harmonious vision of rhythm means that editing, framing, writing, reading of the lines, music all have to be in sync. I don't know this director's work, and suppose he had some top flight help.

Story. The form of the story is competent enough with the requisite 2 1/2 plot twists at the end. The emotional hook here is principled patriotism, which is thoroughly exercised. I wonder about people who complain that a movie manipulates them. What movie doesn't? What is intriguing about the comments here are that people get wrapped up in the politics of the plot, and judge it based on whether it matches their own visceral politics.

Rather the notion that the nation is founded on principles is lost. This could be great art if only, if only there were some way to make people face the way they react as they do. Film art is about the viewer, not the creator. Still, it is a curiosity that anyone would wonder, after Newt, Lott, Army and Burton why a smarmy Republican and his sanctimonious posturing wouldn't ultimately become stereotyped fodder for popular art.

Lastly, some comments here and in the press assume that Dreamworks' heavyhanded left-leaning was to influence the election. Be serious. Whoever is president cannot affect them, only the Congress, and they are relatively cheap to buy. In today's market without campaign finance reform that's even less than the budget of this film. Dreamworks just wants to make money by creating a stir. Oldman was indeed miffed at that editing: not because it was unbalanced politically, but because it lessened his creation of a hardwon multidimensional character.

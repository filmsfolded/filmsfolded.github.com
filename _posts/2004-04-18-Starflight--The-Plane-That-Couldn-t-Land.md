Spoilers herein.

There was a time when the universal symbol of technology was the locomotive. Then, odd as  it may sound today, it was the large steamship. And for a brief period in our history it was  the space shuttle.

All of these passed from their iconic status after stupendous accidents. I write this shortly  after the US president (Bush) tried to weasel out of some political problems by proposing a  bold mission to Mars. The American people yawned.

This project is dreary in every respect. But it has two interesting elements. The first is that it  evokes that brief period when were awed by this machine. It is doubly odd because when  brand new it used only thirty year old technology as a matter of mitigating risk.

The other thing is the score by Schifin. It is equally dated, a mixture of horns and bongo  drums. 

Ted's Evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can probably find something better to do with your time.

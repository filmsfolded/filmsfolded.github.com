Spoilers herein.

I admit to being swept into the play. There's nothing complicated here, and everyone involved is committed to direct simplicity. The two leads are committed -- that strength and the cleanliness of the vehicle carry the day.

But I have to tell you I was disappointed. That's because film has possibilities way beyond this. A story of such angst, such ambiguity deserves an intelligent. layered eye. So much of the matter of the film is centered on dreams, fantasy, multiple realities. So much could have been made out of this in the form of the film.

Guess we are lucky that this filmmaker stayed within her limits. But this material deserves better, deserves more than competent working of established conventions.

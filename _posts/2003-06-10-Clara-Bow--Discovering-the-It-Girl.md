Spoilers herein.

This TeeVee documentary is included in the DVD for 'IT.' It is well produced and has a whole lot of welcome footage. It is worth watching if you know little about this phenomenon.

But in one of the most amazing missteps, it is narrated by Courtney Love. It is a misstep in part because she just doesn't know how to read well, but there is a greater discomfort.

Clara changed the world, and that's a fact, one of the most interesting stories in all filmdom. It was a matter - I think - of an extraordinary capacity to project a certain vitality which was easy to tag and sell.

Probably, there are three things that have to come together to create a social revolution: 

-the 'stuff' has got to be right. In this case it was a refreshing, sexy independence, a studied negation of coyness. Probably all her New York girlfriends were this way. That's society's part.

-There has to be a connection with society. Film already was inventing the new world, and I credit her with developing/exploiting the language that expressed the above. That's her part, and I think it had to with obsessive promiscuity and redheadedness as much as acting ability. She really isn't very pretty when she isn't posing her face, nor very alluring in terms of body shape.

-The third component is market forces. Somehow, the forces which bring things to the public must be satisfied - those that make it possible for us to receive it and that incentivize all the surrounding trades. Part of the equation is film as a product, but film is only a wrapper. The contents must be defined enough for them to know what they are selling and us to know what we are buying. The notion of 'It' is vacuous, but it serves the purpose.

Which brings us to Ms Love. She's not the lead car in a train, like Clara was. She's one of the cars several thousand women back. What we needed was another redhead.

This documentary could have zeroed in on the promiscuity (whether exaggerated of not) as a key to what was being sold.

Or it could have focused in on Hollywood as a deliberate consumer of fresh energies, and her openness being both her success and doom. Or it could have dealt with her childhood sexual abuse and hereditary madness in a real way. All of these were touched on in a ginger, polite way. None was faced head on. None was dealt with as Calara would have.

Spoilers herein.

Woody's films, enjoyable or not, represent a walk though all the larger philosophical  observations and experiments in film. Most of those - at least in this period - have to  do with how the camera distorts reality.

We get this in the reinvention of history overlain on the very nature of a fake  documentary. It is echoed in the story, of course, which gives Woody a chance to mug  and romance his new girl. (She 'saves' him.)

Anyone who thinks this is about a man needs to have his license to watch Woody  revoked.

I consider this a practice session for his best film: 'Sweet and Lowdown,' which deals  with these same issues, in the same way but so much more subtly and powerfully. That's  in part because Woody's biggest liability as a director is Woody the actor, and he  substituted the best folded actor in the world. But it is also because 'Sweet' didn't have  the distraction of manipulating old film.

Still, this is a pretty sweet idea, the idea of having a character be sufficiently powerful  that he is able to actually modify existing filmed history.

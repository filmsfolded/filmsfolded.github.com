Gosh, what an amazing artifact!

I understand the context was a wild rush by all the powerful studios to make lavish song and dance movies, and this was Universal's. It differs from the others in the way it exploits cinematic tricks. Its why it flopped, they say. And its why it is such an interesting historical document.

Superficially, it is 100 minutes of non-stop vaudeville show, often with the stage explicitly noted. This sort of entertainment was what the studios thought was safe, but as they went to extremes in all the ordinary ways, they went to extremes in converting the show to cinematic form.

So we have magical appearances, superpositions, games with size. We have the show referenced as a giant book on stage. We have the band-leader played with. Now normally there is a folding where you have some sort of a skit or story about the band, and another level of show which the band supports. The first episode in this has the band-leader as a cartoon character, in Africa "earning" his crown as king of jazz. It has to be Africa, you see.

We have the cinematic tricks echoed in much of the humor, which depends on misdirection and disguise. You can see that many numbers don't fit the overall scheme, because they must have been simply developed independently and inserted. But the big numbers still use camera tricks. I suppose the reason it failed was because it was "too experimental" for the ordinary audience.

I'm having some dealings with Hollywood deciders at the moment, and get frustrated when they want to define the mass viewer as unwilling to advance even a little. This film should be watched if only to see what was too cinematic to swallow.

There are better von Sternberg Deitrich projects. The only charm of this one is the America situation.

I never got the charm of Deitrich, and if you didn't, you'll find this empty. It has three stage performances by our blond Venus. 

The first of these is pretty obnoxiously strange. The chorus line is thin white girls with blackened skin and African face paint. Afro wigs. They gyrate in a weak emulation of Josephine Baker. They thump around a gorilla. After a bit our blond seductress emerges from the gorilla suit and dons a blond Afro wig.

Its both passionless and revolting. The whole picture is a bit of both, passionless in a direct way reflecting that continental nonchalant tone which later became beat. Revolting that such a story would be assumed to matter to us.

I saw this first when it appeared, and then again recently.

The first time around, I was deeply impressed with the existential tone, within which Hoffman's character amazed me.

Now, the picture seems cheap and the acting mannered. Did I change that much? Probably, but I believe that much of that change is an evolution in what we expect from films. Part of this is a recognition of clean presentation values, the writing, directing, acting. Part is the significance of tone we need to get something to keep.

The acting here by McQueen is pedestrian, only that of Hoffman is interesting. He impressed a few decades ago simply because of his commitment. But that's common now, and with finer discrimination, we see how artificial are his mannerisms.

A primary device here is the notion of confinement in a seeming paradise. This was novel enough when new, but even in the past few days, I saw a much more rewarding cinematic treatment of the notion; 'Proof of Life.'

Sadly, I report that today, this film is not rewarding enough to watch except for historical interest.

Is this the only major "escape" movie not referenced in "Chicken Run?"

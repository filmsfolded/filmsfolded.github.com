The film you are meant to see is blatant commercial appeal for your dollars on the backs of 9-11 firefighting heroes. Each of us will decide whether we will allow that, and what the relative benefits and costs are.

So decide. 

But behind that is another film, one behind all the mugging and cheap tricks. Fire.

There are certain things that are inherently cinematic. Water, smoke, fireworks, architecture are ones that particular interest me. Sex, motion. 

Fire.

I suppose the director of the sappy front movie had someone manage the fire segments for him. They really are spectacular and by themselves worth watching, even if the rest offends.

Fire in film is usually a matter of a growing fireball. Boring. Making fire dimensional, environmental, is a real challenge. The goofy story here is an excuse to do that. "Backdraft" was a similar excuse with a similarly unimaginative story. 

There are a few scenes here where our guys enter burning buildings and the blocking of the thing allows the space to be wholly animated by fire. It becomes a sort of other world, with its own rules that we sense through the medium. It is what motivates the story, such as it is, beings from a world of order and jokes entering another noirish one where fate is capricious, and the tussle between the worlds. It isn't a deliberate design -- that would be beyond the capability of everyone that is involved here.

But that design is there if you can see it.

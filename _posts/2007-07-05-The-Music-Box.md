I confess, I don't find these guys to be funny. Its the humor of debasement and destruction and there are better, more clever ways to be amused. I suppose this is the best of what they did, though.

There is one amazing bit of humor here. Remember this is the precode period. 

They encounter a pretty blond maid, taking a baby stroller out. She's a bitch, and gets kicked in the butt. The term used is the title of this comment, which has to be one of the richest and bluest comic lines ever written. And we thought these were physical comedians!

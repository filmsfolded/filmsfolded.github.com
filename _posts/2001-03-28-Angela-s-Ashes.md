Spoilers herein.

Great films transport us to different worlds and confront us with the unexpected.

Poor films dip into the common vocabulary of everyday images and use them to simply manipulate us. This is a poor film; one manipulative, unoriginal episode after another. Not a shred of imagination. Not one surprise.

What's wrong with the people portrayed is that they have no control over who they are and how they react. They are manipulated by the arbitrariness of a society that is based on solid roles and rules.

A real film, a good film would transcend that in its perspective. But we are plunked in that dark room and presented with what? We are manipulated by the arbitrariness of a film vocabulary that is based on rote roles and rules. We have no control, but are blindly manipulated in just the same fashion as the sorry characters we are watching (and pitying).

Makes me feel dirty that I am swept up in these emotions so blithely. How different am I from this family to be played so by Hollywood just as these characters are played by the Church?

Makes me angry at McCourt, who is credibly accused of making much of this up in order to manipulate us - he is a world away from Dylan Thomas who knew how to create rather than copy. Makes me disappointed in Parker, but then look at his career since the original and fresh 'Fame.' He specializes in the shameful exploitation of the obvious.

Ms Watson is quickly moving up to my short list of actresses to watch, with Cate, Kate and Julianne. No matter that the film is exploitive. She brings a focus that is extraordinary. She transports. The child actors are honest as well. 

In a decade or so, if Emily matures and becomes as well respected as, say Streep. Then this film will be worth watching to see what she is doing, how she is moving within her skin. Otherwise, better to cry over a real life.

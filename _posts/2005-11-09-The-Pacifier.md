This Disney division must have a staff of writers to churn out scripts all according to a plan something like Erle Stanley Gardner's. He literally had a circular sort of slide rule with all the various plot elements he thought encompassed the genre. When he wanted a new Perry Mason story, just turn the sliderule and fill out the combination it showed. These were immensely popular, easily generated and satisfying to many readers. 

Disney himself was intrigued by what Gardner called his "fiction factory," and consulted with the man in setting up his non-animation division, Buena Vista.

From that tradition comes this. It cannot be called a mess. It is competently enough produced. It has some comedy (kids like diaper jokes), some action, and the essential support-of-kids message that these things need. 

The weakest part is Diesel, who may have the intensity for Riddick but not for a drill sergeant. Even the kids in the audience snickered when he tried to act tough at the beginning.

So, on and on, you have set pieces, distributed through the children, all circling around that on moral that sells: family.

If you want to know if there is anything at all worth watching in this, or exposing your kids to, yes, there is. Carol Kane who is in the first few minutes after the obligatory action sequence opener.

Kane is given pretty much no part, and she disappears early. But when on screen she so far outclasses everyone else you wonder why they let her on the set.

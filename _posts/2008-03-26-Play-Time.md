I saw this with "Seven Steps to Satan," and I must admit I liked the other better.

Yes, this is fantastically cinematic. Yes it has all sorts of wry and comic effects. Yes, it is rich. 

But its what it criticizes: it is superficial, stylish, amusing but essentially vapid, polished and busy on the surface but with thin artifice.

It really is what it pokes fun at. The attention to being occupied. The obsession with seeing but not understanding. Yes, I appreciate the deft humor, and credit it as better than much. But to what effect? Is the only job to keep our eyes chewing which the screen flickers?

Spoilers herein.

One of the several foibles of the United States is that we have no indigenous sexual  exotica. All sexual archetypes are inherited from predecessor cultures (excepting in the  competing synthetic African-American cultures), which is one reason -- I believe -- that  US popular culture is so widely consumed internationally. We repackage.

Not so with India, which has had time to develop its own subculture of sex, one that  though small is part of every Hindu's makeup -- one in fact that probably plays more of  a role in Muslim/Hindu clashes than any theology.

Although this is cheesy movie, it is a little interesting to note its popularity in the US. Sex  isn't the same everywhere you go. But exotica seems to be.

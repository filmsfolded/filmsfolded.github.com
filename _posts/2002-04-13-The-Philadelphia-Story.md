Spoilers herein.

I'm walking through a list of best films and most popular films. This is often on both lists, so I re-viewed it.  I saw 'Woman of the Year' right before. It is based on the same general theme, providing opportunity for tearful, closeup apology and conversion to 'normal' human.

This film is marginally better that that disaster. The dialog at least has had the advantage of some polishing. The backdrop is populated with mere stereotypes. In the foreground, Stewart really does have grace -- good thing he was able to do solid work elsewhere because his hiccoughing happy drunk here is wholly unoriginal. Grant has one classical Grant moment: when he rings the candles near the end. This has some Mankiewicz touches: he knows how to overlay celebrity on the role, and that's all we have here folks -- the very type of Spy magazine celebrity that the film makes fun of. How ironic that Mankiewicz was utterly destroyed by what this system wrought ('Cleopatra').

But this is Kate's picture, no doubt about that. She was in fact a prideful, arrogant prig who had suffered several boxoffice failures. Like her successes, these had little to do with the merits of the films or her acting. The public just didn't like her.

So, she started a campaign to rejuvenate her image. The play was written for her specifically to satisfy this need: to show she could discover a heart. She worked it out on stage, then managed this comeback.

The film has only two interesting features for me. The first is how Hepburn's face was made up and photographed. I understand this was a matter of much experimentation, and became the standard for all her black and white work (the color work would never be as good) as well as for many who followed. The lighting requirements (few front lights to accentuate the sunken cheeks) sometimes meant that the men standing next to her looked odd and malevolent-- something about which they complained.

The other interesting thing concerns the subtext of the story. The frontmost matter is the tripe about a perfect woman in all regards except lacking a heart. (And the bit about that being the cause of her father's womanizing!)

But the backmatter is about stooping to the reality of the fan magazines' celebrity machine. And that's what this is, pure and simple, with a nod that the writers behind the machine are often talent men with a higher calling. I'm sure the writers added that on their own.

This Holmes franchise was already in serious trouble by this time. The story has nothing at all to do with the traditional detection of Holmes and in fact he acts like a regular film detective of the era. In other words, he simply places himself in danger and solves the crime that way.

There are two notable things along the way in this disaster.

The first is the introduction of mesmerism as the agency by which the evil professor performs his villainy. One wonders that if he could control his subjects so well, why not just tell them to bring all their money instead of concocting such a risky and costly plot? But never mind, the idea of hypnotism is a standby. It had appeared in "Caligari" and would again soon in "Manchuran Candidate." Here it is merely something to take up time between the tired beginning and the dreary end.

The real great little piece is a meeting between Moriarty and Holmes. Watson is held while Moriarty comes to visit Holmes once it is known that Holmes is on the case. If Holmes was the detective he was in the earlier films, he would have already been on the case instead of having to be asked. In any case, he anticipates that Moriarty will appear, and when he does the conversation is something like 

"You already know what I am about to ask

"You already know my answer

"Is that final?

It is a few moments of the Holmes as he originally was written, a man who plays mental chess, who would die without a worthy adversary or problem. Its only a few moments, and acted poorly. But they sure are memorable. They are the only thing I keep of the Rathbone Holmes projects.

Most of these dramatizations are inadequate and any written by Exton wash the wonder of Christie out of the thing. So the production then has to depend on luxurious sets and supposedly interesting characters.

That's not enough for me. But I do have to report that the director here has done some clever things. The lighting is atypically superb for TeeVee. There are some very nicely conceived shots that indicate Poirot's vision.

But the most interesting thing is how this director has created Poirot. He's at least slightly different in every episode, and very different in this one. The excuse, probably is that it is the earliest story.

Here he is human before being officious. He is tentative, not annoying. He is certain, not vain.

Its not played for comedy as usual. He's an earnest inquiring eye (and hand).

Most of these are trash. But at least this one is colored well.

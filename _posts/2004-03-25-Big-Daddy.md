Spoilers herein.

Its always been an American film staple to have a simpleminded but purehearted hero.  Chaplin invented the image. He would be appalled at how the notion has been

appropriated by the US Republican party. An excellent character is all that matters,  especially compared to the archetypical Democrat played by the worrywart "responsible"  father: the real Big Daddy.

In this case, it is more than just the image that has been stolen, on which Sandler has  built a career. Here we have a whole movie stolen, down to the fawning eyes of the kid.  Wouldn't be much of a crime if they worked harder at it. But it is put together in such a  slapdash way that it sputters all over the place.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Spoilers herein.

I must admit to mixed feelings about this film. My reaction while watching it was astonishment at the genuineness of the images. Incidentally, these are lovely, following a European cinematic standard that is higher and more painterly than that of the US. The story is so daft, it quietly recedes into the background with other cultural quaintnessess.

In this regard, the extent to which the other worldliness of these people is captured was far, far more effective than Scorsese's 'Kundun.'

But I let it sit a couple days then came back to it. Watched the 'making of' feature and saw it again. And this time was disturbed. A key value of film for me is the ability to transport to other worlds by visual means. Usually for me, that other world is the creation of a talented filmmaker. But here that world is 'borrowed,' is a real world, and the equation gets all turned about when we become voyeurs. 

Reminds me of a remarkable film of some years back, 'Gods Must be Crazy.' A 'primitive' man finds a coke bottle dropped from a plane and returns it to the sea. The actor was a real bushman whose life was pretty ruined. A wash of selfish exploitation, a sort of white man tourism, clouds the enterprise. Can we ever see others through these glasses?

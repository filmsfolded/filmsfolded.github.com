Its pretty amazing to watch the old physical comedy deals. 

Some seem to stand the test of time, namely they make me laugh, and I'm a sucker for the pratfall. But this is neither charming nor remotely funny.

I searched this out because it was Fatty's last picture, a dozen years after the scandal.

He was by this time several decades a heroin addict it seems, and still clinging to an endearing, agile fat character.

This short has two halves: an encounter with a beehive and subsequently swallowing a bee, followed by the unrelated destruction of a chinashop. 

The events are all designed from well established formulas so what really mattered was the tone of the thing. That tone is set and maintained by the comic nature of the reality created: a funny car, funny pants and walk and so on.

Fatty was able in prior years to create some of that magic; here he simply echoes it, relying on his frequent costar and some gags that have little to do with him.

He was already effectively gone when this was made, showing up only to lend a familiar face at 46.

This is considered the best of his last period. It lacks the manic pace of even moderate Keaton or Chaplin and is at about the level of tiredness as much of Abbot and Costello.

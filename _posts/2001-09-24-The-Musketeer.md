Spoilers herein.

I've seen most of Hyam's films. Dreadful they are, and this one too. At least so far as story, score and acting. But you knew that.

But here, his lighting is very appealing and to my mind actually redeems this, especially if you see it on a big screen. There's nothing original that I could see, especially on the _movement_ of the camera. But if you just look at the pictures, they're quite enriching. Not a must see, but definitely some gems, rather like much 'classical' music: It's banal, but oddly hypnotizing in its chocolately overtones.

Two minor points. The sound editing is pretty adventuresome and is equally rich. And not just the thuds of skulls but the jangle of chains, squeak of leather, splashing of bathwater against Mena's back. And then there's Tim Roth. He works, not just walks through as Deneuve and Rea. I'm convinced that he is not a bad character actor, but that he acts as a bad character actor acting a part above his head. We know he can act, certainly the best in this cast: 'The Cook, 89,' 'Vincent, 90,' 'Rosencrantz, 90. Once you see him there, you see that he acts the actor not the part. Check out his solution to the face puppet of 'Planet of the Apes.'

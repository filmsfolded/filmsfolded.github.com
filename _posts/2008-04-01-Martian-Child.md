It had to happen, I suppose, so I arranged to view the Father film with the Child.

"K-Pax" tried to merge redemption with the ambiguity of storytelling, specifically an alien identity. These sorts of things depend heavily on what the actor brings to it. Spacey clearly understood what was required if he couldn't quite deliver. Its the self-doubt behind most mysticism coupled with the confidence that is behind most survival. 

Since that film worked, at least better than most, its inevitable that we have this, which I can well imagine was pitched as "K-Pax with a kid."

In this case, the chemistry changes. In the previous film you had the heavy acting pulled by the storyteller. We had a designated watcher in Jeff Bridges, certified two different ways. Here the watcher must be a storyteller because the heavy acting must be on his side. It has to be engineered that way because the target of the story is a child. All he has to do is look endearing and lost.

Cusack, then has to carry the narrative. He's given an ever so weak framing to work with: the story we see becomes the story he writes instead of a planetary fantasy. It reflects and supports the story we are supposed to watch. This means that we need to have watchers outside the story in order to maintain the folds. In this case, they are "child service" workers. Its a bit awkward compared to K-Pax. There the similar group (headed by similarly typical character actors) can decide to lobotomize the alien as punishment. Here, the penalty isn't clear. What's the alternative?

Anyway, its only interesting if you have a need to cry, especially if you were a lost child. Or if you are interested in how scripts are constructed.

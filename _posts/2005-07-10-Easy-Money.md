This is truly dreadful. It consists of four segments, each exploring the human effects of a windfall. In one case it is an illicit windfall.

What's notable is the relationship of this to the TeeVee series it spawned: "The Millionaire," where John Bears Phitipton (I hope I remember that right after 40 years), would give some random person a million dollars then invisibly watch with the audience.

That was an incredibly powerful notion, having a character join the audience. None of that here.

The final segment is a bass player in an orchestra who buys the whole place, turns out his despised conductor and elevates his instrument to the forefront. This one was good enough to actually watch. The others weren't

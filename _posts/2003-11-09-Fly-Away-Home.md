Spoilers herein.

I study movies. Usually movies are so mechanical and clumsy that I cannot avoid  watching myself and others watching it. But once in a while, a movie teases me into  itself. You end up committing energy to drive the story.

Such films carry a special obligation to respect that commitment by taking it seriously  and not feeding back any irony. 

Ballard did this for me. Of course you never really know that it has happened until you  are rummaging around the attic of your imagination and discover what it has left. In this  case it happened for me after watching 'Winged Migration.' That was an extraordinary  experience, but seriously damaged by the insistence of the French filmmaker to tell  stories.

Those stories were eagerly consumed by us viewers, but they ruined the whole project by  removing it from its context. It was more animal circus-ish than acceptable. If you are  going to insert a story, I thought, it needs to be the story of Mother Nature herself. Or  some large slice of her.

That's what we have here. Except for a few tiresome mechanics at the beginning and very  end, it relies on just the sorts of emotions and connections we'd like to be fooled into  thinking drive the universe. Naturally, one man's Mother is another's Hallmark treacle.  But in this case, for me and my wife, it worked.

Especially remarkable is the prior roles of these women: Delany had been the damaged- but-sweet bondage queen on a sex island. Pacquin had been the damaged-but-sweet  victim of adolescent misdiscovery. Here, all that appeal transcends sex.

I'll follow Ballard on any outing he plans.

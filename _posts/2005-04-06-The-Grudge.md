Friends, this is a grand time to have a life in film. There are real advances still underway in this still new thing which is more about how we imagine than how we entertain ourselves.

A particular device that interests me is the trick of transporting the viewer into the story in a way that actually works. Scary movies have this as a particular challenge because you cannot be afraid of something that doesn't actually threaten you.

Check this out. It is a cross between the timeshifting usually associated with "Pulp Fiction" and the "watching" mechanism that worked so well for "Ringu." In this case, we have three watchers: the first two are a child who becomes an agent in the haunting, and Bill Pullman's character who stumbles onto the scene both as witness and cause. With this setup, we are introduced to a third "watcher," Geller's character. 

She has some elements of the detective, this inherited from many prior horror films, necessary because this is how much of the explanation is presented. But that's in the background here. Her main role is literally to exit her reality and enter a deeper reality as the watcher of the murder, watching also the first two watchers.

In order to achieve this reality shift, the writer does something very clever. He slices the story up, shifting from time to time and among several related groups of people. This makes us watch closer, investing us deeper in the thing, but that could have been accomplished otherwise. The main effect of this shifting is to make it seem natural that as we shift, so can Gellar. When she does, she becomes us in a visceral way. Off-screen watchers get folded into on-screen watchers. Every image we have seen becomes a demon.

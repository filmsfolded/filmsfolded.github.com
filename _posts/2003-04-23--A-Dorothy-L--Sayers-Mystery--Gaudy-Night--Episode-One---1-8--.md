Spoilers herein.

Sayers is something of a giant in the mystery business. She was the first to take the fairly complicated beast in the direction of an inner dialog. The detective mystery is a struggle among reader, writer and detective to invent the story.

Sayers expanded the struggle to one between two damaged but brilliant people: one a mystery writer herself. The book is a wonderful dance for control over the greater environment of truth with lots of dialog about controlling the lesser environment. All this and sex too.

Unfortunately, this TeeVee production starches all that out, substituting an ordinary 'mystery' that superficially resembles the book, with some dialog that superficially resembles something intelligent. 

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4: has some interesting elements.

Forty years ago. 

When I first saw this, I was completely captured by it. I was a simple soul who believed in simple situations. It was a bad time, a time of evil politicians and a bad war. This resonated, as a strong soul, casually defiant. It mattered in an affirmative way, to the emerging counterculture (what we thought was such, anyway).

Twenty years ago, I saw it again and was struck by the genre nature of it. The 30's was the previous era where the powerful establishment was distrusted and people suffered as a result. In that time prison movies formed a strong genre that has all but disappeared now. But the then it was a subgenre to have an innocent, good man, often a war hero, sent to prison to suffer at the hands of the man. By simple dint of Biblical-quality goodness, he wins in some way. The viewers silently celebrate, and then left the theater to fight their own fights with the system.

It struck me how similar this was to that template, and how similar the reasons. The only difference was that in the 30s the audience would be swept toward socialist ideals and in the sixties the war was against some disembodied notion of domino communism. And the genre had to be hidden by setting it in the south, then as now evoking a backward people.

But I just saw it again. Since the last time I have heard Paul Newman speak of it. He is annoyed because he can see himself obviously acting. His character works when the character is acting a role -- and we see him do it. Its an unintentional fold, the sort of acting that Paul could pull off in later years, starting with "The Verdict." But because the job is bigger than his chops at the time, you can see how poorly he does when his character isn't creating a self: when he comes back to the barracks beaten. When he speaks to God. Even when he says that famous last line. He is inadequate, and the idea that a lessor self could be so attractive kept him drunk for decades.

Its really not a very good movie: a collection of templates put together at the right time and striking a nerve.

A pretty remarkable phenomenon. Now, I wonder, where is the modern equivalent of this film, one that seems to be about charm, but which depends on dishonest politicians who destroy us? Will it be a jail movie, or does that reference not carry the same weight today?

As I write this, Paul is ill.

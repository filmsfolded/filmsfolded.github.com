Some friends recommended this because of the enfolded reality and story.

Jean Claude, an actor in the film, plays himself as an actor between films who gets entangled in a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie-like robbery. If there was charm in this construction, it would have had to come from the actor himself. It doesn't. 

Its actually quite a mess, with some internally cinematic references, some talk about movies, and a frenzied scene at the beginning where we see JCVD in an action sequence in a movie within. Two of the thieves play roles to each other.

None of this is integrated, or even in the same world.

Oddly, we know this guy can do something along these lines successfully, "Replicant," "Maximum Risk," and The Order."

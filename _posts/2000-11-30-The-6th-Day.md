This is an excrescence. Who ever thought that a good science fiction film had to be a blowemup? But it has two interesting elements.

The set design so far as the laboratory is excellent, in fact that whole building. It so stands out from the caliber of all else that it must have just been delegated to a master. The notion of theatric space has different requirements than regular architecture. It is harder. The helijets are just stupid in comparison.

The basic phenomenon of Arnie is also something worth remarking. Why do we like or at least pay to see these bug dumb guys?

Stallone is different at least in origin. He had a unique vision with 'Rocky' and didn't rest until he got backing to make it as writer, director, actor. It blazed new ground with the handheld camera, and changed the art. Of course since then ego, steroids and apparent genetic stupidity have turned him into a joke. American filmgoers have deep stereotypes, one being the dummy preening macho latin.

But that cuts two ways, and where we make it harder to give Sly any credit, we are willing to bend over backwards to cut Arnie all sorts of slack. He's much stupider than Sly, having never contributed to the art. He's even a worse actor, if it matters. But it doesn't. I believe that's because Arnie fits a different edition of the big dope, the big Germanic/Nordic dope. This is amplified by his public persona, ultraconservative, viriley family-oriented, addicted to military accouterments, ability to solve every problem by force -- basically a cleaned up Nazi.

Why do we like this?

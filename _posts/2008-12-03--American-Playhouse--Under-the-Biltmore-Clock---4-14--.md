I am pretty sure that I have seen this F Scott Fitzgerald story adapted elsewhere, but I cannot find it. Its similar to the recent "Intolerable Cruelty," but with more surprise.

Its nearly the double-con genre, and there is some ambiguity about when our heroine discovers the plot.

This production isn't very good in the sense of allowing us to have fun with the material. Fitzgerald would have tossed us about with different styles of humor. The potential is good. What he would have done I think is seduce us into hating the gold-digging girl, then slowly make us feel sorry for her, with the successively bizarre encounters. He would have done it well enough that we would believe that this was the turn of the thing. The joy comes in the unexpected, that swoop at the end.

We see the carcass of this in many films, that "final twist" it is called. But usually those are simply clever surprises that are not integrated into the narrative flow. (An obvious exception is "Sixth Sense.")

One of the problems is Sean Young, who tried to make a career out of vacant prettiness. This was made between her two tolerable movies.

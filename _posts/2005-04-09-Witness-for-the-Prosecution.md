Christie is one of our most treasured and adventuresome experimenters in narrative twisting and knotting. She's a master of taking popular material and packaging it in complex ways that are accessible. Wilder is a master on the converse: taking sometimes complex material and packaging it in simply accessible ways.

There's a mismatch that works against the material in these two strengths. Still, Wilder pulls off what is the best Christie adaptation in the sense that he retains the possibility of figuring things out, though Deitrich's disguise is pretty thin.

Christie tried every way she could map of shifting our expectations of who is providing truthful elements of what we see, or think we see. In this case, it is folded into a play within the play in the form of acting for the benefit of a jury. The twists are in the liar, the intent and the guilt.

Funny thing about Wilder. He made competent movies of all types, including the two folded masterpieces: this and "Sunset Blvd." But he doesn't seem to have captured a lot of subsequent filmmakers in his wake, while Christie has, By the hundreds.

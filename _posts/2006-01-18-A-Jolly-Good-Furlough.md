I've been watching propaganda movies recently. I don't think we appreciate the government influence on the industry, and its easiest to see here.

In this case, the message seems to be that GIs can be relatively happy away compared to home.

The story is that Popeye comes home to his girlfriend and family and finds them a hassle, so much so that he runs back to the front and shoots at the messenger that brings further leave. You can almost see the memo about what it was supposed to illustrate.

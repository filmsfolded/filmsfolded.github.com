Spoilers herein

Cat's eye comments* follow:

Don't be fooled by the deliberate misdirection. This is a film about a beautiful girl named Jill (played by Susan Ward).

She is a lovely veterinary student who lives across the hall from some Seinfeld rejects. They are obsessively hollow, creating irony for irony's sake (as if that is possible). She has a single date with Hal. He falls for her, but she discovers that he is, well just not worth knowing.

The comedic device is that Hal is given the ability to see women as they are. Inner beauty and ugliness are what he really sees. Guess what? Our gal Jill is shown to be as lovely inside as outside. The story turns on a joke that viewers are on to: she spies Hal romancing a morbidly obese woman and thinks he must be deeper than she thought. But we know differently -- he is shallow as ever. He thinks he is with a knockout, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (who is actually unflatteringly photographed).

As predicted, Jill -- sans panties -- aggressively approaches Hal, thinking she has found a good man. He is tempted, but it hasn't occurred to him that she wasn't turned ugly (like the nurse) when he was charmed. So he turns her down to marry the fat gazillionaire. A sad, sad ending.

As with all great film art, this one contains some mirroring, here of the veterinarian leitmotif. Turns out Hal's shallow friend was a good candidate all along for a veterinary student. One of Hal's and Rose's friends walks like a dog. Rose's father owns a pet food company , where Hal works in sales. At the beginning, Jack's dancing is canine. A rather disgusting dog-related scene was omitted to be replaced by Mauricio crushing a hot dog. Presumably, all this is to subliminally suggest that some women really are dogs inside.

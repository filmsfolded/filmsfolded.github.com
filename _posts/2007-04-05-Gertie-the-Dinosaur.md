Dinosaurs, or to use the term used here, dinosauruses.

This is a remarkable little film. Oh, its important because it was very early animation, and advanced for the era, but its interesting otherwise.

Spoilers here, if such a thing can be said of something like this.

The film is in three "real" scenes. The first is a group of artists, all cartoonists, I think. They are on a "joy ride" and conveniently have a flat tire in front of the New Yor natural History Museum, where they view a brontosaurus fossil. One of the artists makes a bet that he can make the dinosauruses "come alive."

Second scene: the artist at work, with a comic interlude of a clerk spilling thousands of pages.

Third scene: the artists at dinner, where our hero first draws a dinosaurus, then "shows" his cartoon. The cartoon is remarkable to some and has some historical interest. But what's more interesting to me is the relationship between cartoon reality and photographed reality. We see the dinosaurus in a sense at the beginning. Later we see the artist draw it and then we miraculously enter the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the artist (a lifelike representation) enters the cartoon where formerly the cartoon has entered the dining room. This may all seem trivially folded today. In its day, it was remarkably imaginative.

But this sort of adventure is gone now, extinct.

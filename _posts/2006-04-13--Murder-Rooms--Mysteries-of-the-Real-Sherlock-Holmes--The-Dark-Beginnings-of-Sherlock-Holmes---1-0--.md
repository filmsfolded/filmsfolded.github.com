There are some peculiar things about this, most of them having their own charms that add to its attractiveness.

Sherlock Holmes is not translatable to the screen as I've explored in dozens of comments. Since we as movieviewers have learned to do everything by reference, we don't need to. So we have this bank shot on Sherlock.

I enjoyed it because of what it signifies, not because of what it is, which is actually a hodgepodge of mystery components linked not because they naturally coalesce, but because they are the things at the front of the store.

So, for instance, we have the notion of the serial killer who doesn't kill for himself but to "display" for the audience and his detective nemesis: clues placed to tease, the following of a "script," here from the Bible and the targeting of someone important only to the detective.

And we have a detective staple that appeared well after the Holmes stories: possible solutions that the story reinforces and which prove false. There are more than the normal allotment here, even for modern detectives.

We also have the BBC values of "faces and places" where we pause from time to time to enjoy the attention to prettiness or charming authenticity of the thing. Our designated sweetie here, a redhead, is particularly sweet.

Does anyone pay attention to how these things actually work? By this, I mean the actual deduction. Holmes' notions were placed in a Victorian context where men of science believed that the mind was a machine that could be rationally dissected. (Doctors were men of science in those days.)

Holmes' method depended on this assumption, plus a few other attractive notions about honor, the intrinsic beauty of intrigue and the joy of direct action.

Look at this and see how poorly the author has captured the spirit of Holmes or Doyle. The deductions aren't linked to the logical machinery of the examined. In this story, in fact, there are a couple blind alleys that come from this oversight, this lack. 

Holmes would begin with the mind of the criminal: how would she or he think and move? Motivation and will. Bell never even goes there. Never tries, never is aware of the possibilities. He is all about the detritus that falls about.

So he makes some mistakes that give us as watchers a couple nice plot twists. I guess these are required by modern standards. But they ruin the whole mental enterprise, don't they?

Spoilers herein.

Some films aren't cinematic and are actually plays. Character-driven comedy is particularly vulnerable to this, which is just fine. But Billy Wilder is an intelligent man. so builds in some self-reference to the film-as-play.

The only real cinematic move here is when we (twice) slowly zoom in on Shirley's face when she starts to spin a fantasy. Since the effect is so rare in the film, it carries some power -- there is something special about you watching a story which tells another story. And of course, the main attraction is Lord X.

Lord X is every comic actor's dream: an actor playing a character who acts as another character. This device establishes yet another layer. Comedy cannot exist without abstraction, and here we have several levels:

--the clear self awareness that this is a play with the deliberate handling of the camera, small sets, and introductory narrative.

--the setting in an ammoral France, which in 63 was something of a pretend land for most moviegoing Americans

--the creation of Lord X within the action, as noted above.

Just so that we make sure to get the joke, Lord X creates his imaginary life from films. Here are the ones from the current IMDB list: The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Gunga Din, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Hound of the Baskervilles, Sink the Bismarck, Guns of Navarone, Lawrence of Arabia, Mutiny on the Bounty.

This is all annotated by mentor 'Moustache,' who has also played many roles, but in the past.

The bit at the end where X takes on an independent existence is exquisite film humor.

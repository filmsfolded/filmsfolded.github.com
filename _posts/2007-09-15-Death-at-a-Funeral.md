Frank Oz is a minor talent. He'll always be in the relationship with Jim Henson he presents here between the brothers: one is a highly successful creative talent, and the other just doesn't have it until or unless the chips are down. Then he can give a powerful, audience- stopping presentation of clich√©s. That's the story, the fold, that is at the heart of this: everything else is jokes.

These comic situations are very well paced, in the sense that the movie increases its tempo and the tone gets more and more artificially comic. Death, queerness, drug and poop jokes click, click click through the wheels turning faster. I laughed as I was supposed to, part of the machine. But it wasn't me as a person, it was me as part of an amused audience.

These sorts of things never work if you watch them alone, or with people other than those desperate to laugh.

Spoilers herein.

Both Columbia and Miramax have reflection offices. That's where they manage experiments  in folded teen movies. The idea is that if they run through all the permutations of the  reflected formula, they may get a hit, but at least learn a whole lot about how sophisticated  the viewers are. At best, they'll advance the expectations for sophisticated folding, thereby  providing competitive advantage to those with good market tracking.

What is teen folding? Consider that all teens - every one - are playing roles. So what if we  get a kid playing a role, and lots of blacks playing the same role. Now put actors in the story  that play actors playing the role, to get the kid to 'unplay' the role that he thinks is real.  Pretty clever. Add in a sprinkle of politicians playing roles ('Bulworth').

The story itself is completely incidental and almost unwatchable, revolving around the fact  that there are two kinds of parents: those that are simply clueless, and those that are  clueless and know it. (There are two similar types of teens, but that doesn't figure here, see  'Napoleon Dynamite' or 'Ghost World' for that.)

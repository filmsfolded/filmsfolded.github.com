America was at war. All Hollywood was pressed into the war effort, but Warner lagged behind. So Warner pledged to produce the most patriotic picture ever.

Cagney was under congressional investigation as a communist. So he pledged to be in the most patriotic picture ever. Cohan was a shameless exploiter of cheap theatrics who claimed he could raise any soul by resort to the flag.

Along the way, they determined to make the crippled president seem like a graceful dancer.

All these turned to making this, what we see a few generations later. Alas, the effect is still the same. America is still at war. The current president is the most cinematic ally savvy.

Perhaps you can use that knowledge to stand outside this movie and enjoy it without being slavishly manipulated. That's because under all the tawdry jingoism is a pretty good performance if not a good movie.

Cagney really is worth watching, in nearly any project. But he is at his height here. There's a priceless routine where he plays an old man and the performance spills into real life as he meets his future wife. The penultimate scene is his dancing down the White House steps after playing the president and winning a prize.

Fast forward through the cloying death scene.

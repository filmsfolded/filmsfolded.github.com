I'm watching a bunch of movies now for historical value. Many, like this one, were entertaining at one time. I suppose you can get some pleasure from being reminded what type of person you were or could have been to be entertained by this, but its not quite the same is it?

The historical value is in the overt self-reference, what the popular press calls self-reference.

This started life as a play, the sort of play that people wealthier than moviegoers could go to and be amused instead of challenged, where the immediacy of theater was squandered so that some folks could be pleased with having completely enveloped and mastered a clever narrative.

That it is a film of a play makes it slightly more interesting and somewhat lightens the repulsive notion of people needing to be occupied, their food chewed for them. 

Here we have a playwright writing a mystery play that we see, the script in the typewriter literally being what we see. Its "Seven Keys to Baldpate." A truly clever origamic elaboration on this model is "The Shining." The elaborations we have here are two. One is that we have in fact that we have two playwrights involved, spatting gay lovers. The second is that they stage (at the beginning) a play within the play to scare a woman to death for her money. 

She's incidentally perhaps the earliest older woman (45) presented as sexy (in a movie way) in a Hollywood movie. (Mrs Robinson only acted sexy.)

The twists are two. One is interesting, that the younger man wants to make the play within be the play without. We know this will happen because we have the play we see. The second twist is that the battling playwrights kill each other and the script we see is actually produced by a "psychic" neighbor, our surprise designated viewer. 

Seeing these two actors (Caine and Reeves) reminds us of two similarly "self-referential" projects they were in, "Sleuth," and "Noises Off," both better.

Also, seeing two men kiss (in the most minimal and stagy manner) and read all the fuss Caine made about it, seems amazingly strange today.

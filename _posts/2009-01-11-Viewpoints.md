I'm watching a few films by this young filmmaker. This one has a very interesting notion in the story. Very interesting.

Its a film, within which is an experiment on film viewing which goes awry. Within the film or ambiguously the experimental film within is the story of a lost wallet. The boy who takes the wallet is the subject of the experimental film accident. He is convinced of a different reality, that of yet another film which possibly could be yet another next.

Its a promising idea, one I relish. But we make these rich, folded narrative structures so that they can be explored and exploited in cinematic ways. I know this fellow can do this from his other projects. He doesn't here. The idea is so tantalizing that perhaps he will try again perhaps starting from the perspective of the actress.

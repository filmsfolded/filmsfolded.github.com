I'm really interested in these early clever narrative folds. 

Here's the fold in this one: the movie we see is -- we discover at the end -- written by a character in the story, produced by another and presumably featuring actors we see in this movie as actors playing characters playing actors playing actors.

Here's the story: a playwright wants to get a producer to produce his play. So he tricks him into a strange house where actors are assembled to perform the thing as if it were a real spooky murder. The pretend victim ends up dead in reality, and from then on the players leave the play and enter reality. The producer discovers the ruse at this point so he shifts from believing it real to believing the "real" thing is a play.

Overlain on all this is another drama. A madman has escaped from the local loony bin. It turns out that he also is a consummate actor, and he has his own fantasy to enact. It also draws from spooky movies but in his case it is the mad scientist genre rather than the spooky detective story. These two fictions compete for dominance in the spooky house.

The actual production is plain with values typical of the period, which means that you will likely find it boring. But the idea is remarkable.

One folded joke: the producer is coughing. His assistant says are you okay? Producer: "Sure, why?" Assistant; "Because you were coughing horribly." Producer; "You think you can do better?"

Charles Belden, the writer, was a sort of genius at these sorts of folded things. He did "House of Wax."

What do you do if you are in the animation business and are not Pixar? Pixar sets the bar for general cleverness, and specific cleverness in dimensional perspectives and narrative structure. Well, It takes a decade and some risky management bets to build that dimensional skill because it requires a corporate culture. But narrative cleverness just requires a single person or small team with sufficient strengths to execute.

So if you are the Dreamworks crowd -- famous for being risk averse and cheap -- you simply buy some humor and use it to cover sentimental devices which are known to work. That allows you to sneak some mean anti-Eisner humor in there.

But what if you are a new shop with a bankroll big enough to do all the ordinary things well enough. And you are given a charter to take risks? You take risks in the narrative form and try to outclever Pixar. I see that they tried hard here and in my opinion they succeeded.

They took an ordinary worn-out plot and placed a couple folds on it. That plot: have the courage to be yourself (dejected, gifted man is counseled to come back to enjoy himself). It uses the usual Yoda advice: Just be, relaxing into yourself and excel, do not strive.

One layer is the inherent dichotomy of any sport, but particularly surfing. The value of the sport is in the doing. Its unique so far as I know in its attunement with the dynamics of nature. Sailing has some of this, but is essentially about leveraging technology. Surfing is immediate, solitary and -- so far as the surfer is concerned -- completely without intermediate technology.

The strangeness comes in with it being packaged as a spectator sport. The path is obvious and also followed by basketball: the sport as a token for a role you can adopt: an attitude, a being. It captures a collection of urges. Its a puzzle. No one that truly is a surfer would watch it as a competitive sport. This is used in the narrative to create tension. Great fun is made of the promotion of the sport for spectators and particularly the pumping up of personality cults. But the narrative under exploits precisely this: we watch. Its no accident that the surfer in question is played by "The Dude."

The second fold makes the first one work. This is a fake documentary, with two layers. One is outtake sort of stuff where the participants speak to the film crew. The other -- seamlessly mixed -- is the documentary. And that is seamlessly mixed into the story we would see if this were an ordinary cartoon.

See how clever? See how easy it is to do?

Still, this rewards the watcher, even if you feel conflicted after watching some one else surf on painted water.

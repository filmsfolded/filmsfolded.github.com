Well, you know you make friends and any good friend you don't abandon, no matter what. 

We get old, things change. We relax into what we still imagine is risky adventure. And in friends we don't point out the reality that what might have been important then, isn't now. 

Herzog is a friend, a good one. I've trusted him in the past and when he's let me down it has been honorably. So I'll come to anything he makes, even though I know sometimes I'll have to make excuses for him.

And that's what I have to do here, apologize, justify.

When Herzog approaches a project, you can see that it has only one conceptual thrust. Just one. That's been fine for me because he takes that one idea -- whatever it is -- to such extremes with such honesty and commitment it blossoms into levels that resonate.

The idea here is similar to one he has explored before: the images don't matter, anything can be used, even stock images. The story doesn't matter at all; any tripe can suffice, the more generic the better. There need be no point, no message, no root into your soul, or the group soul.

All we need is aeolian sound, edited in a way that corresponds in an obvious way with splashes of color. Its the rhythm of the thing, established aurally and only then visually, with the visual pace lagging. Its a way of letting us know that anyone who does this can impart religion of any content.

Throughout is a supposedly wised up guy constantly reminding us that he could have told us so.

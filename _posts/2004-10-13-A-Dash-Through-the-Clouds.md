Spoilers herein.

It wasn't until Tarkovsky that we got a truly dimensional awareness in our camera, and not until 'Finding Nemo' that it hit the mainstream. There was a hiccup there with the first 'Star Wars,' but it faded fast.

Not that we didn't always want a swooping camera. Here is the first statement I know of a potential for three dimensional perspectives. Of course the camera doesn't actually fly, but I doubt that mattered to viewers 90 years ago. The very idea of a human swooping about might have been enough.

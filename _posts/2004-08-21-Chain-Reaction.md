My goodness. The interesting thing about this movie is not that it is universally scorned as bad, rather that it is so similar to dozens of films that pass for good enough. In fact, you might track Morgan Freeman as he stumbles from one film to the other. Mostly, they are like this (except two) projects that appear to be experiments in what excess will be tolerable by the public.

Typically, the plot is thrown together from borrowed bits. Some bad feds, some suppressed miracle, a frame-up. Lots of explosions.

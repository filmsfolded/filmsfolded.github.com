I'm a little annoyed at the folks that poke fun at this.

Sure, all the production values are poor, but this is just a matter of degree. If perfected imagination is defined as the images you dream and you set that at 100, well maybe this would be a 3. But lets be honest about stuff you don't laugh at, like "Star Wars" which would probably be a 5.

Its all a matter of negotiation, what we will accept as "real." The reason I'm annoyed is because this is a pretty cinematic ally conceived project, and we don't have all that many. Just think about it: the monster in the closet (actually called a closet!), telepathically communicating with the disembodied head of a mad doctor's sexy girl friend to plot revenge for their situation. That idea should be enough.

Here's a test. Play this movie just listening to the sound as if it were a radio show. Yes, the acting is still hesitant, but doesn't that make sense in a self-referential way?

Any "bad" movie that works with my eyes shut isn't a bad movie in my book. Its just an inexpertly done good movie.

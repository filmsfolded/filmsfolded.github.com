Spoilers herein.

Some experiments from inexperienced writers and directors work. Some don't. The more they copy, the worse. This fails.

There are some good ingredients here:

--Some good (but not great) actors.

--Some interesting words.

--The selfreferential device of a film of someone sentenced to die who happens to be a maker of films for people sentenced to die.

But. The director is weak, so no ensemble emerges. Interesting words do not make for mastery of language. The use of the advice videos is clumsy, further confused by the lack of development in the narrator's (Warden's) character.

There's nothing interesting here. No signs of promising talents to watch. That's a puzzlement, because this writer kid is all over the place:

Such drek as 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Conair,' the latter with a Mr Shhh/Buscemi character.

But 'High Fidelity' was really sharp. The self-reference worked there. 'Beautiful Girls' was a well conceived vision.

Just goes to show, I think how sometimes things fall one way, sometimes another when you are marginally competent.

Walken's bound gangster was better written and performed in "Suicide Kings."

Spoilers herein.

I believe that the future of film is now firmly in the hands of Spanish-speaking  filmmakers. Not that they make the best films, but that they have the current crop of  ideas. We saw Italians introduce us to the notion that a camera can be tethered to the  soul of a character and follow him around. This is still the standard of the much  celebrated Scorsese.

The French were briefly interesting when to this they added the notion of reflexivity,  where the mechanics of film-making became a character. Hollywood - in their more  interesting films - extended this notion of folding to an amazing collection of ironic and  self-referential devices.

Meanwhile, Spanish literature was long incubating a synthesis of fabulism within self- reference (Cervantes invented the notion) combined with earthy sensuality, sometimes  natural energy.

So in contrast to the Scorsese-led 'character' stuff, and the often mechanical Hollywood  folding exercises, we get Spanish films from Medem, Almodovar and Garcia. Rodriguez is  very much in this camp. And now this.

Yes, it is overly long and uneven. Yes it is artificially gritty and has some dishonest  performances. But it is extremely well constructed, both on a dramatic and conceptual  level.

Folding in this context is placed in the fantasy of rather than perspective or character. 

Why give several stories? Taratino does because Kar Wai Wong does, and his motive is to  bleach the story away and focus on the musical texture of the mood. But Garcia does it  ('Ten Tiny Love Stories,' 'Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her.') to synthesize a  single entity out of many and a single larger context out of the many sketched situations. 

The focus is on that larger context, and what magical dynamics are at work. It is pop  cosmology as art drawn from drowning the soap opera content. It is new melodrama -  melodrama is when the characters are puppets to external forces - with attention to  interesting exposition and subterranean channels of those forces.

Fate. Dogs as astrological entities.

Jean Cocteau bears a heavy burden for me. He's an artist, a serious one. He's one of very few French filmmakers who after the war -- excruciatingly embarrassing for the French -- was rebuilding their cinema. But most of all, he was a contemporary of Welles who disparaged Welles.

So okay, Jean, what do you have? 

Well, later he would have something at least interesting. This isn't, excepting for two things well done but not exceptional. 

The cinematography is better than usual. The copy I just watched was in poor condition, but I recall seeing one decades ago that was rich, and was projected properly. By cinematography, I actually mean the quality of the prints as silver photographs and not what we mean today in terms of camera personality.

The other novel element is the set design. Its inspired, the notions of including human elements, but not genius. The staging and script involve too much coming and going for this to be valued highly. There is one nice scene where the father discovers his ship has come in but to no benefit and he cannot afford to even spend the night in town.

This is not the work of a cinematic genius, but an artist dabbling in film. Its not important.

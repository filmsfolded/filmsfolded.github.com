Sometimes you can watch a movie as it comes. Then you can be totally open to whether it works, whether you like it. But sometimes -- and this happens a lot with me -- you really WANT to like a movie. So you watch it with yearning, anticipating that the last piece is going to fall into place in just a moment and completely reinterpret all you've seen so far.

The good part keeps getting pushed further and further into the future until the thing ends with a disassembled motor and you with a broken heart.

I wanted to like this movie because it has my favorite framing: a cartoonist is looking for an idea. What he draws and what he lives merge. This is an elegant folding most successfully done with "The Muppet Movie," and can be miraculous in how you move the fold into your "ordinary" life.

So I watched "Monkeybones" with the same hope and was jilted, just as I was here.

The problem is, I think, too many script bosses from the studio. Some wanted the "I'm a bad daddy but you taught me better" movie; some wanted the bad guy versus the good after the style of the very pure "Spy Kids," in which Alan Cumming was great. Some wanted the simple collection of slapstick that made the first one a hit.

And then there were the dog and baby humor lovers. Each one of these factions contributed about a fifth of a workable movie.

No matter, usually I can artificially recreate a good one from just one thread if that thread has any strength. Not here, friends.

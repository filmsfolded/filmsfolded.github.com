Spoilers herein.

One of the strongest influences in how a society imagines itself is film, and of films the  strongest are where the characters are most abstract. Abstraction can be through  cartoons or cartoonizing, stereotyping or extreme dramatizing. But the most elegant to  my mind is when everyday creatures or objects become the character.

Dog movies are a special genre. They often follow a Marlon Brando/Steve McQueen sort  of American-branded rebel, as here. This one is a runaway circus performer.

We have here a simple wallowing in what we admire in this character, reinforcing our  own: loyal, resourceful, ramblin'. Except for that exercise, this is elevator music.

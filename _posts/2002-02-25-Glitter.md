Not Gold

Spoilers herein.

This isn't a very engaging film, but you knew that. Is it really because the acting is bad? Surely not in this day of Julia Roberts and Angeline Jolie. The music is not so bad, not compared to the likes of the rest of what is served up via MTV.

The blame is universally put on Maria, who understandably has since wilted under the storm of criticism. But the lesson here is simple for me -- the filmmaking skills of her support team are execrable. That's the problem. We know how to make anyone look good, from the Pussycats to Madonna to Michael Jordan. Heck, Altman even took a bunch of non-singers, told them to write their own songs and made one of the best films ever.

It was just a bad call, that's all. How odd that one of the few storylines is about this very thing. They had two choices: either outMTV MTV, or completely throw the audience off by riding another pop trend. Since the goal was to add 'dimension' to their product, the latter was the only way to go. I think I would have done the Dancer in the Dark routine: destroyed her in public, as it is obviously what would have happened anyway.

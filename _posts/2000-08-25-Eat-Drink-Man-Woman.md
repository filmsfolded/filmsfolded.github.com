I found nothing interesting about this film but the food. The story and craft are all fine, just not memorable. But the food was rich, and that alone makes this an important film.

Film is a solvent art. Successful film leverages senses and emotions outside of itself, moreso than other arts. Only dance and architecture are similar in the directness and externalness. Violence, sex, celebrity, betrayal are the usual suspects. Food has been done before, but it appears to be difficult to evoke the sense of taste as richly through vision as we need.

Lee has the advantage of Chinese cuisine, the preparation of which is strange and intriguing to Americans at least. He captures us by the mystery of what is going on by showing a lengthy preparation session before the first "story" scene, so we are in suspense about context.

But Lee also has real art in what and how he has placed the images. He understands that it doesn't work to focus on the food itself. He gives us rich sounds -- gosh, what sound editing skills! He gives us movement as edibles slide from one implement to another. He gives us aromatic visions as things sizzle and smoke. He gives us ceremony in the presentation, but all BEFORE the table, made special meditations because once things get near the table, they are treated casually.

Here is an echo of the hundredtwenty year old debate in the academy concerning easel painting. Portraits (character studies) are acceptable, human art. Landscapes are "real" art (in film, think of "Lawrence," "Out of Africa"... Ford westerns... maybe 1/4 of all films). But, so the academics held, "domestic still lifes" cannot be real art. At least we know this form is difficult and therefore rare in painting. 

More difficult and rare in film. Lee is an intelligent student of film, so understands this well. Experience this film; you won't be sorry.

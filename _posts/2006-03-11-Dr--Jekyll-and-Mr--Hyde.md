You'll no doubt already know that this is severely limited by the poor acting skills of Tracy and some of the tiresome script necessities that set up key situations. For instance we have to sit through a half hour of explanation for why the betrothed are separated.

But here's what you will be rewarded with: 

--Terrific sets, just terrific. I shudder when I enter an MGM film, expecting a sort of competent ordinariness in the background, but these sets are very well engineered for subliminal effect. Not comically Gothic, but richer than anything human could be.

--Except for Ingrid Bergman right before "Casablanca." This was her favorite role and it shows. I don't know what it is about screen beauty, why it works and how a successful actress can enhance it. But this is a pretty amazing experience, seeing her this way. Her demise is disappointing because we imagine she could have carried off something more explicit than disappearing behind a sofa.

--The third seduction of this is how the story has been changed. As written, it was what it announced itself to be, an interior battle between two halves. Because it was literature and the writer knew how to do it, you really could enter the mind at stake and relate to the strife. This adaptation moves it all outside the mind as it must as a movie. (There are several scenes where our doctor is late for a performance, either a play or dinner.) Its been adapted so that the war is between good and evil as embodied by two women: one is blond, good, respectable, obedient. Played by a nitwit and one wonders why our good, rich doctor would ever envision a life with this nothing.

The other is gay, open, adventurous, vulnerable, the Bergman character. She is manipulative in an immediate, shallow sort of way. This woman will always give pleasure in her being and often be hurt, we know. She is so seductive, so inherently good, it muddles the movie because it is she we all want to be with, to protect.

Directed by the guy nominally involved with "Wizard of Oz" and "Gone with the Wind."

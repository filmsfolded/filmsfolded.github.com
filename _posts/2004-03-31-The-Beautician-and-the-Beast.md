Spoilers herein.

I suppose there's something comical about a Russian Jewess singlehandedly reinventing a  Warsaw pact fiefdom. 

Projects like this are structured so in two parts. The first is a simple situation that leads  to the man running to the woman at the end. That part is immutable.

Along the way, we are supposed to be charmed and amused, and it is here that we could  on expertise. Alas, there isn't a laugh or sweet moment in the whole thing.

I think Fran's widow's peak is fake.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

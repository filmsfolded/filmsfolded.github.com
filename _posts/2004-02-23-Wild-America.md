Spoilers herein.

This is the 'Blair Witch Project' except from the other end and as if it were done by the  scooby gang. It is an absolute excrescence, except for the amazing visage of Francis  Fisher. If only the woman could act, it would be great because the camera loves her so. ... And those aerial shots are always a nickel's worth of pleasure.

But it is on my list because it is a (bad) movie about the making of a (good) movie.

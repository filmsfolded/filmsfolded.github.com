Spoilers herein.

Film is about creating an artificial world with touchstones to reality. The musical is another game altogether -- it is a matter of grabbing a few threads from the tapestry of life and staging them in a pleasantly noisy way. The mix of the two has always been uneasy, but here we some something unique, worth watching. That's because this plumbs the heart of magic.

Drama is based on a common notion of magic which (at least in the west ) begins with the Arthur legend. It defined our expectations of what magic is, and what magicians are. It literally set the tone not only for the English notion of self (through the 'Fairie Queen' of Elizabeth) but -- by way of Shakespeare and Marlowe -- our concept of writer as magician. Everything flows from this.

Here we have a musical where the music doesn't matter. The story and acting are mildly interesting, but what matters is the staging. We have some magical interior spaces: the throne room is one of the most interesting sets in all filmdom. The wedding scene is one of the best uses of the architecture of fire  I know.

The DVD has a very interesting advertising bit. Interesting because it has Harris in his Sergeant Pepper persona.

Vanessa Redgrave is ambiguously redheaded here: In 'South Pacific' Josh Logan played with with recoloring the whole scene because the magic emanated from the location. Here, he has refined that. All the magic (at least in this version) comes from Guinevere. See how Logan has colored here hair in such a way that colored lights can make it flaming red or bland blond as the situation requires.

After getting established, directors run out of their own bank of ideas. They cast about for something new and interesting -- and/or they become craft for hire. The former has more integrity, 

So when a book with real gas appears, Hollywood jumps on it.

The good here is that there is some strange atmosphere here to be mined, and Scorcese does well enough. The surprise here is that Cage fits the recipe: he's usually too obvious an actor. But here his externality works to emphasize the character's rawness. Plus his partners are more internal in contrast.

The bad. Scorcese should know better how to adapt for cinema. There's some nice work here, like the three quick flashes of the daughter in the waiting room. Like the shots of the ambulance going down the road. But it is grafted on to a written narrative, and all the really good images are from voiceovers.

I have conflicting feelings about the common use of songs. It seems like a cheap shot if the visual values aren't strong. On the other hand, Van Morrison is used so effectively I'm truly impressed.

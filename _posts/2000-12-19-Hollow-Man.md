Making a film is about abstracting and consolidating all the elements at your disposal around a single vision, then ruthlessly exploiting that vision to achieve what you want. In film that vision has to be cinematic above all -in general successful filmmakers develop a single strategy to deliver a well crafted film, and some intelligent directors try to master several strategies.

All too often, the strategy is to rely on the simplest of cinematic principles, the visual. So we get explosions with lots of plasma, plus whatever the latest technology can deliver. In 'The Perfect Storm' it was CG water; here it is the advance toward CG humans (in two scenes at the beginning and the climax at the end). It is possible to use these as tools to create a tone that resonates, but all to often that resonance never appears. 

'Star Wars' creates a unique tone, and is a success despite bad acting and a hokey story. 'Hollow Man' doesn't, so is instead hobbled by its actors and writer. Verhoven has had too many tries at this and too many failures. Only 'Basic Instinct' instinct keeps him alive in Hollywood - the tone there was built around simple misogynism, and thankfully there's only so far one can go with that.

'Hollow Man' is a particularly troubling as the H G Wells story itself successfully constructs a tone that is pretty disturbing and memorable. Effects and a competent vision could have built on that to produce one of the best films of all time. Bacon isn't great as actors go, but he is one of the best when it comes to understanding this notion of collaborative tone and contributing to its ruthless progress.

No more Verhoven for me.

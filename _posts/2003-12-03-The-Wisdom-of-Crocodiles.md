Spoilers herein.

I have a hobby of carefully selecting films to see back to back. The very best experience  is when you find two films that are imperfect by themselves, but when merged in one's  mind become complete and powerful.

This worked for me with 'Maze' and 'Immortality.' Both are about diseased, talented  men who fall in love in an unwanted fashion. One involves birth, the other death. In  perfect symmetry, one involves creative artifacts as art looking at bodies, the other art as  actually being produced by bodies.

One is a vampire movie. Vampire movies NEED redheads. The other film has the redhead,  in almost irresistible, lovely, perfect openness. The vampire film eschews the compulsion  and involuntary action usually found in the genre, where the other one embraces it.

You really need to see both to see how perfectly these merge, how the impossibly sweet  love of 'Maze' fixes the problem with 'Immortality' that the power of the love just isn't  there. And similarly in 'Maze,' the curse of the blood is always present, but never MEANS  anything beyond a few comedic moments. 

Conflate the two and you have something constructed like Lynch's 'Blue Velvet,' where  darkness and light, love and curse, are played out as the battle between two film genres.  'Velvet' had those two genres in the same film, but you as an intelligent viewer need not  be so limited.

You can even use the hooks each already provides: 'Maze' shifts to shaky POV when the  Tourette spasm strikes. Insert there, parts of 'Immortality.'  'Immortality,' on the other  hand - following the French tradition - introduces the viewer (the policeman) into the  story. He 'creates' the vampire by watching: insert Lyle Maze's artistic process here,  which in his home film is equated to the literal creation of a human (which is then  introduced at an exhibit).

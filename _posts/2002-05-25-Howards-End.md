Spoilers herein.

A film about a book about books and bookishness.

A film with excellent actors, all warmly competent and no one taking any risks.

A film with Branaugh's current and future lovers, trapped in a clash of ethics, morality and passion.

A film that satisfies without nourishing. Painterly but without art.

But what interests me: it is a drama centered in the sense of place, revolving around a specific building. Many of the best films deal with architecture cinematically. But this one missing a rare opportunity -- this cast with a better crew, one more aware of how film works -- could have done something important, life-altering. But alas, not this time.

See for example the risks Helena takes in 'Fight  Club.' That both West and Thompson take in 'Carrington,' a similar enterprise

Books and Movies, Books and Movies, the eternal struggle of conversion. Books are from Mars...

I've recently been studying film versions of Austen. I believe it is possible to make a decent Austen film because the center of her imagination is in the situation. Everything follows from this, narrative tone, presumptive judgment, the motivational physics of the world -- and of course the characters. In fact it is essential to realize at the start that the characters are at the mercy of their situation -- indeed wholly shaped by it. 

The mapping of situation from the reader's imagination to the viewer's is possible.

But Dickens is another beast altogether. His art is in the  creation of characters. The characters come first and everything else flows from that. Readers often notice the complex plots, but they are mechanical, the children of Bulwer-Lytton (and often not as well constructed). These works were meant to be read piecemeal as serials, without a real grounding in the story anyway.

Characters. Dickens' beings find their existence not as an evolution of literature, but of the stage. British theater of the time was populated with great exaggerations, and it was Dickens' innovation to transport them to the page. It was an tremendously clever, modern idea: these were not stories about life, but stories about plays about life -- each character is not a character from life, but what you would get from an out of control actor playing someone from real life.

So mapping BACK to the stage is a perhaps impossible trick, because the mindfood of Dickens depends on the separation, the distance between the two. Lean is oblivious to this problem; so far as he is concerned a story is a story. On this story he hangs the elements he knows best: very artful framing of shots. Expert editing.

I fully realize some readers will be aghast at the following statement, since this film retains so much of the superficialities of the story. But this is as about as far from Dickens as one could get.

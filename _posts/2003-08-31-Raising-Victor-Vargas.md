Spoilers herein.

Slick slick slick posing as raw raw raw.

This little project has appeal in the sense that Hollywood romantic comedies do. It is  obviously the product of a great deal of rehearsal and polishing. But it is framed as  realism, shot in a documentary style with lots of jiggles in the camerawork.

The problem is that every shot settles on a stylized frame. Every scene has been  economically refined to the point that it is abstracted from life. Every bit of dialog is  perfect. 

That makes the fake spontaneity of the film precisely like the fake coolness of our Victor:  it endears and we readily embrace it because the alternatives aren't appealing. But at the  same time, we see right through the artifice. 

As with Judy, we know we are getting attention because of reasons that have nothing to  do with us exactly, only that we live in the neighborhood. As with Judy, we know it is all  an act.

I did see one actor that impressed me: Melonie Diaz , who has the thankless role of "the  friend who reminds." She seemed real, and had amazing screen presence without the  strutting of the others. I would track her next project down.

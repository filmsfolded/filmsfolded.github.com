Spoilers herein.

Rich potential: New York a la Woody; writer creating her own life; snappy dialog; sex as philosophy, set in a 'perils of Pauline' context with anachronisms as a running joke. But the New York wasn't bookish and chic enough. It failed like the recent 'Great Expectations.' The attempt at snappy dialog was energetic, but the cadence was all wrong, and that makes up for even the grandest stretch in the words. 'An Ideal Husband,' is the recent example of perfection of this art. 

The problem isn't Parker. It's the director.

I'm particularly attracted to films that fold reality in themselves: plots where the story involves its own creation. These abound in several forms, and some indie films have actually explored new territory recently ('eXistenZ,' 'Memento,' and 'Mulholland Drive' come to mind.) But this offers nothing new, so it is doomed to be compared to other examples of the same.

Parker is a conundrum. I think she has a good instrument, rather flexible. I've seen her in 11 of her 37 listed film projects, which I think is comparatively high given the poor circulation of many. Never brilliant, she's been adequate and varied. I think she would have been up to this if she were directed to be less frantic and unappealing. And if the director knew how to clip the dialog like Jennifer Leigh in 'Hudsucker,' or James Woods in 'True Crime,' or Robert DuVall in 'The Paper.'

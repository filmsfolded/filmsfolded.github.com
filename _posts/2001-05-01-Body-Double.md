Spoilers herein.

De Palma has to his credit perhaps the best movie so far about the camera; 'Snake Eyes.' That film is so intelligent in what it does, he would have had to have some practice at thinking about and working on the problem. Here is one of his experiments.

It is a convoluted mess, patently designed to work out how much plot folding can help with self-reference. Here, we have:

--Us as voyeurs watching a voyeur. (Not at all like 'Rear Window,' since that world was created by the camera and driven by confinement, this world is created by an actor and driven by sex.)

--The film about a film being also a film within a film (with the porno film even within that).

--The actors all playing actors; every major character is a body double.

--Hollywood as the porno industry (an incidental jab, thrown in passing); the thriller as cheesy horror (a more direct jab).

But he tries too much in front of the camera and not enough with the camera itself. Clearly, by 'Eyes' he had decided that the camera should be the focus for this type of film about films.

Readers send me recommendations of films that use architecture cinematically. Water, smoke, fire (fireworks), are the usual supplements to built space. To that I've recently added cloth, based on a reviewing of "Brother Sun." This was recommended.

Its an early, intimate film from the man who later brought us epics that sometimes work with space: flying leaves, smoke, fabric, knives. He's quite committed to cinematic architecture, space. I appreciate it. In this case, the project is small, with few aspirations. The story is a familiar one (two men, a woman and a shared child), and really quite ordinary except that the acting is good. The real center of this is the house.

Its a combination of residence for the two men and woman, and a business where the three dye fabric and hang it in long bolts to dry. The place is wonderfully, gently photographed in places, and that is to be expected. The way the thing is staged is very typical of Chinese films of the era: every shot is carefully arranged with the surrounding space emphasized with color, planes and light. Its not dynamic, but very effective. I include this in my list of "folding' effects that bring the viewer into the world of the film. Making space, always impinges on our space.

But there's another effect at work here. I like it when this filmmaker uses the environment as indication. This is also typically Chinese, but usually has to do with political events or natural disasters, of some such. Here, when the cousin and virgin wife do have their first sex, a long newly strip of fabric, perhaps 35 feet long, makes a waterfall of red collapse into a pool of red dye. Its a remarkably powerful image capturing blood, a sort of gravity of sex (both senses), indeed an inevitability. Its the entire tragedy in one scene, the human copulation just off screen.

Later, this pool would swallow both the men, one after another. The transgressor will end up literally in this pool of red, with the very same inevitable, continuing drape falling over him. Its not the cleverest or most subtle working of architectural space into cloth and thence into nearly a character, one that indicates and has agency, both as the force that starts the tragedy and ends it.

Its worth it. See it before you see that later epic excesses.

Spoilers herein.

Truffaut had a particularly heavy burden, being French and unable to escape it.

He started with new ideas and then assimilated himself into the filmmaking ideas of  others, just with a patina of intelligent self-reference. It peaked in 'Day for Night.'

All his films are about films and this is no different. Here he makes a mechanical film  about ideas, with a chief character who is mechanical about ideas, and those ideas are  from writers (Balzac, Gide) who are themselves mechanical thinkers.

The camera is metronomic. The pacing expectant. Every scene, every shot begins a  moment too late and lasts a moment too long. It is well enough done, but as it is an  intellectual exercise, the ideas aren't strong enough.

This film contains the famous kitty scene parodied in 'Day for Night.'

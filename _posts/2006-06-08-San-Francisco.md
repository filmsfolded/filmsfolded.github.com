I'll take one of these any day over "Gone With the Wind." Its the same mentality: copiously defined characters but only with grand qualities. "Blackie" with a heart of gold, his childhood buddy the Irish priest obsessed with "lost" souls, (Singers outside of opera are lost souls.) Its a cartoon, yeah. But it has some of the best dialog I remember. Its an ordinary setup for an hour and a half, an innocent woman torn between two men. But then the earthquake strikes. These effects are amazing and photographed with craft not normally seen from Hollywood.

Made in the middle of the thirties when movies were trying all sorts of things, defining their future as they went. This reestablished cosmic scope into the equation. Van Dyke had just done "The Thin Man," an amazing feat of steering. This is mawkishly sentimental, and has a trite conversion to God at the end. Its actually embarrassing with the soldiers of Jesus marching back into the destroyed city to rebuild it singing the Battle Hymn mixed with San Francisco.

But it is cinema, the grand new cinema, and worth celebrating.

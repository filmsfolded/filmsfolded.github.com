Kieslowski is essential viewing in his three long form masterpieces, the Colors trilogy. His strength is in layered realities, each that annotates the other according to an ineffable model. That ineffability is the lasting magic of his work, not the content of any layer.

His decalogue projects are all short film, involving only one layer per film. All ten considered collectively layer like the long form projects do.

He extended two of the short form decalogues and induced a layer or two. This is one, so is an in-between case, essentially practice for the more ambitious and less explicit projects.

But what practice!

This is voyeurism about voyeurism, something that teases us into obsession about obsession.

The story centers on a naive boy enchanted by an unknowing woman who herself seems excessive about desire. All is a setup for their encounter where his commitment to the desire destroys the engagement. 

Can real love be anything but obsessive? Can obsession lead to anything other than its own neutralization? Can that end be reinvented to both comfort and bear comfortable gifts?

Yes, yes and yes by the magic of reimagining, something that movies -- some movies -- do well. In fact, one might say that movies invented modern love by allowing it to BE reinvented.

The mechanism here is by watching, which both he and we do, The telescope is draped with the same cloth that our object of desire, Magda, is weaving into the fabric of her art. She removes that fabric from the telescope at the end, adding it at the same time.

The milk serves a similar function, as do the broken message chains.

We have two moments where the film allows us to reconsider. The first is at the very beginning where the suicide (at this point still probably an attempt) is revealed. A touch is offered with such complexity and delicacy that the entire film then revisits, reinvents and annotates that touch.

The second moment is at the end. This where we learn that Magda may have been the suicide and the touch through the eye (a touch we are offering ourselves at just this moment), allows it to never happen.

I often get requests for recommendations and rarely give them. But if you want a film to watch with someone you wished you loved, if your notion of love is excessively romantic and woven in the aftermoments, if you are sensitive to layered vision and that vision is on the lip of the tipping bottle...

If you are both afraid and unafraid, and touch is what life is for you... then this is what I recommend.

Ted's Evaluation: 3, Worth Watching.

Spoilers herein.

I got around to viewing this film recently, as it was on two of my 'too see' lists: the Food and Joan Chen lists.

Food films are a new genre that can impress. 'Eat Drink Man Woman,' 'In the Mood for Love' and 'Big Night' were successes. The images touch sensory memories that extend the visual vocabulary. It is both enjoyable and intellectually satisfying. But this pedestrian film fails to evoke those memories.

The Joan Chen connection seems one worth following. She is sort of a minor phenomenon, which I first noticed with 'Autumn in NY.' that film's subject was just as unremarkable as this. But it was so well constructed I spend all my viewing time marveling at the craftsmanship. As an actress, she's understated -- a contrast to the hispanically demonstrable Ruhl, but very apt. A study in dramatizing the Asian woman which is quite a challenge since the starting point is deliberately undramatic. I think this same challenge was behind 'Fargo,' the notion of drama among a practiced non-dramatic people.

Chen intrigues me. I'm going to check out her 'Send Down Girl' and get back to you.

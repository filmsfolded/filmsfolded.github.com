Spoilers herein.

Screenwriters first pick their home planet. For Audrey Wells, that is the skeleton of mild self-reference and the flesh of personal drama. That means she makes delicate stories that superficially appear to be centered on those small dramas. Uncareful viewers will actually believe it is 'about' these characters and their lives.

But the basic form is different, leveraging the handling of the self-reference. In 'Cats and Dogs,' the selfrerefential skeleton is the folding of projection of personality: personality through a (radio) medium and in 'reality' within a (film) medium. On that, you assemble some episodes that both appeal and which leverage the folding.

Here, a similar folding device: a collection of images about making images. Building a life equated with the ability to build images. The film as life, the images carefully composed.

Why I like this film: the entire crew knew precisely what they were doing. Each chapter stands on its own, the plot which links them together is secondary, a simple necessity. Each chapter is an image, a visual tone poem, sculpted around a single, breathtaking shot: 

--the small sexy role playing at the wedding condensed into a motion with a necklace (this first one literally turned into a photograph so we get the point)

--seduction by long division

--the artist getting urinated on

--the mother's face right up against the daughter's saying I know what you do

--reconciliation by the exposing of a foot

--the rooftop chair

--our female queen hesitantly standing in the parking lot

--a wonderful expression of distance in the cool observation of the remarkably vulnerable Grace Una

--and of course bookended by the photograph of the Guiniveres

Many others, but those stick. Yes there is some fine acting, but it works because these actors had local images to fill, and the creator of those images to guide them.

Rea doesn't have the edge he would need if this were a conventional drama. But it isn't. He is not a person in the way these woman are.

The title name was not lightly chosen, I believe, but intended to reference the magical part of image: the holy quest made personal.

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching

To appreciate this, you need to know a bit about writing styles. Just a small bit, is about all I know, but it is enough to understand the great struggle this denotes.

There are all sorts of styles of course, but writing professors (those great deciders) like to think in terms of clean and not clean.

The clean ones are easy to parse, easy to navigate. They are friendly to a reader. They are easy to advise if you are part of an organization where one person writes and many advise. A subset of this clean writing is the sort of sparse stuff that Raymond Chandler is known for. In this year, William Faulkner would adapt a Chandler book and create a collection of attractive phrases, settled into a broad story. "The Big Sleep" was successful because by that time we had already learned how to consume small bits as if they stood alone. The only "long form" writing challenge in this model is to give enough of an interesting shape of the story to allow observers in it to remark wittily. In Chandler's case, this is "hard-boiled."

Meanwhile, while the Faulker/Bogart/Hawks billboard model was being shaped, Chandler himself was working on this smaller thing. It fails. Usually, that is blamed on the weak director, or the short timeframe, or the unprofessional actors. But I think what we have here is the collapse of this sort of terse writing in film. We'll see it re-emerge in summer action films, but as an armature for engagement, it is dissolving here before our eyes.

The story is that we have the obligatory night club, that regular stand-in for movies. And we have three returning soldiers. One is loopy, one a cuckold. The wife is murdered and suspicion is variously thrown on the crazy fellow, the night club owner and the husband hero. We find that all these are wrong, that the professional watcher is the killer.

Chandler was drunk during the writing of this, but you can see how his mind is working. Viewers are killing his reason to be. His words are in all three of these suspects, but the one that interests this commenter is the nutjob, the William Bendix character.

He's driven crazy by the jazz music that has been given root during the war. Jazz (at least then) is to popular music as real writing is to Chandler's simple strokes. Jazz is unclean. Each bit of it contributes, but the thing weaves a complex whole. Some bit of it may be inscrutable when you hear it but if it is memorable enough, you will recall it later when it finds its connection with other bits.

Jazz is all about rich agents that self assemble in your mind to produce something unique to how you perceive. It drives the simple minded crazy, because the individual bits don't make sense. You cannot see the end from the beginning.

Hearing this, Bendix's character holds his head and rails against "monkey music." Its racist of course, but here at least in this stroke it is ennobling because the white guys are the simple ones. Today you would call them fundamentalists. And the offscreen black influence is the rich stuff. Life. Complex, rewarding writing that is creeping in.

That makes it ever sharper where one of Chandler's clever lines is "Thanks, that's mighty white of you," when one of our characters is dealt with honestly.

Its a bad movie. But if you want to see narrative evolution at work, visit this.

Spoilers herein.

Detective novels morphed to mystery novels with the addition of several new ideas. One  of these is the notion of intent, which appears in the story as "motive." In the old,  Sherlock, mode, the story was driven by facts. In this new mode, the story is driven by  the discovery of intent. Many people are thrown onto the stage and we evaluate each,  giving us a chance to explore them as people and their relationships with others as  determined by the magnetic causality of the crime.

Sayers was a master at this, with "Carcase" being her best project along these lines. In  this case, we actually know early in the story who the likely killer is and the mistake is  with the facts-- that one fact about the blood.

The story is a matter of implicitly dealing with this matter of intent. The conspirators  intended to make off with the inheritance. The Russian intended to marry and that was  changed. Everything else fades into weather, so far as the mystery except for some  improbable disguises.

That by itself is not what makes this story great. Sayers used this new notion of  exploring characters to similarly explore the intentions of the two sleuths: does she want  to get involved and what is the problem? Why does Peter do what he does? Later writers  would extend this notion in so-called "psychological" mysteries, mostly heavyhanded.  But I find this mix here to be just right. That's because she creates the perfect balance  with Peter and Harriet: they exist in some sense amidst the suspects and indeed Harriet's  existence is first as a suspect. But they similarly intermingle with the world outside the  book, the writer and reader, Sayers and us, Harriet and Peter.

In all this, the key role is Bunter, who alone is exempt from an examination of motive.

Books like this have a triple struggle for survival: they have to hit a sweet spot with their  audience when they first appear. In this case, it was the novelty of how Sayers pushed the  medium. Then later, as the immediate context passes, they have to struggle all over  again for an audience, usually by different rules. Ordinarily, we (readers of "classic" crime  fiction) look to the single quality of whether the characters and situations are attractive.  And then when the odd existence within the written word is mapped to the screen, it  struggles for existence all over again. The whole game shifts, and certain early strengths  may be lost or recast.

In the books, it doesn't matter much whether the crime is indoors or out. But it makes a  world of difference on the screen. That's one reason why this is the best of the three  Petheridge Wimsey projects.

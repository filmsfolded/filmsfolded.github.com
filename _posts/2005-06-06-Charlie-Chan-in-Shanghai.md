The original "Star Wars" had lots of weaknesses of imagination, but when it hit a sweet idea, we made up for all the inadequacies in our imagination. One of these is a roughneck bar where beings from all over the galaxy hang out. In the movie itself, the rubber masks and puppets are unforgivably cheap and lacking in imagination. But we allow it because the idea of such a place is fascinating.

This movie features such a place, the "Cafe Versailles." It is a French Cafe in Shanghai, owned by a German drug smuggler. The entertainment is a Turkish belly dancer and many customers are sailors from all over the world. There's an overlord, an American in secret agent mufti. The police bosses are British and the unraveler is a Scandinavian pretending to be Chinese.

This cafe features opium, which we are under the influence of, I'm sure; because I think we saw the very same set in one of the Basil Rathbone Holmes where he battles Moriarty, the Victorian equivalent of Vader, nay his superior.

You might want to check out this entry in the Chan series just for a visit to this place. Otherwise, this is just one of a dreary parade, At least this one has an uncharacteristic twist at the end -- in the cellar of the cafe.

Spoilers herein.

This one film is perhaps the lead pebble that divides the great waters of film  appreciation. To the left go watchers that just want high quality amusement. To the right  go those for whom film is part of building a life. Film as entertainment; film as art.

The conventional story is that John Ford brought the majesty of the west to the then  moribund western (and thus helping to redefine America); that he helped merge the  mainstream conventions of theater with still newly emerging cinematic ones, and that he  introduced (with John Wayne) a new rhythm in reading lines -- in fact a whole new  posture to performance.

Probably so. This project mixes hackneyed conventions of theater (the group of  stereotypes cast together) with cinematic contrasts: the confinement of the stage, the  quiet of the town (with power lines in the background!), the motion of the openness. No  one is evil in this world, only "otherly motivated." Nearly all that matters is better at the  end than at the beginning.

I see what he has done. I understand its importance. I still think it is banal, lowbrow,  condescending. Ford opened the camera up, but didn't exploit that space. That would  come with Orson Welles, who studied "Stagecoach" obsessively.

Ford introduced a new pace in Wayne's dialog, and he was in this case smart enough to  know what he did. But Wayne himself was too plain stupid and unskilled to know what to  do with it. That would have to wait for Brando, and then Wayne could follow in his later  projects.

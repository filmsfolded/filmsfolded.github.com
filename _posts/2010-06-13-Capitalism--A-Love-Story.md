In my survey of documentary types, there is the personal campaign film. Michael Moore, subsidized by the Weinstein brothers, is the best example of this. The film is not a matter of discovery, though our reporter presents himself as a detective. It is instead an essay on what he believes, with the evidence paraded before us. Whether you like these things depends on two factors.

The first is the most important. In the US today, politics is a matter of tribalism, with the chief goal of vilifying "the other." Tribes stick close together; some have their own TeeVee and Radio networks, other rely on blogs, books and movies. These are all tailored to the members of the respective tribes. They are consumed because they entertain in the sense that the viewer of a movie feels better about themselves. It is a fractionated patriotism, both sides claiming to be true Americans.

Notwithstanding that, the illusion is given that the argument is sound, that the facts are true and they add up. On this score, Moore did a good job on "Sicko." Here he does a profoundly bad job. His facts are wrong. His theatrics are baseless. His arguments vague.

The movie follows Moore as he interviews places and people who have been destroyed by what he calls capitalism. This is interspersed with experts: a couple loopy congresswomen, an actor, priests.... He makes the reasonable assumption that GM made a mistake by not listening to him (since his first movie). Despite being the world's largest corporation, GM suffered as a result and survived because it bought politicians to "bail it out."

But he is in way over his head. He conflates three things that are largely unrelated: free markets of goods, a parallel liquid capital market that finances production, and the corruptibility of elective democracies. These have at root nothing to do with each other. There is no question that the US is in trouble because of the mix of weaknesses of these three, but an understanding has to go deeper than vilifying "the bosses."

A strange example is his focus on employee insurance. Large companies take out insurance on higher level employees, payable to themselves. The insurance company has carefully computed that it will win the bet overall. That is their motive. But the employers like Walmart can win too, because they have an investment in keeping their employees alive; namely that they have found them, trained them and integrated them into the company. Losing an employee is a real loss. So if one dies, Walmart is partly able to cover their investment to pay to hire another supervisor.

This dynamic helps jobseekers, or at least a good case can be made so. It is why liberal lawmakers encourage it. But here, the somewhat complex dynamic is reduced to human tales of companies benefiting from death, while crying children starve. Let's hope that the Weinsteins not fund any more like this and make Moore go back to putting together a good case. He did in "Sicko." He could again. There are plenty of targets.

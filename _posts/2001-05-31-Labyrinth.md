Spoilers herein.

I've read every comment here, and no one can argue that this film has quite a following with folks who saw it as children. I wonder about that. I generally like most every type of film, and 'the Muppet Movie' is one my all-time favorites. But I will mar this film's perfect record by posting a polite dissent.

This film is Alice meets Sendak meets Dorothy meets Python, meets Glam -- and it has none of the charm and depth of any of the originals. The acting is poor in my estimation, the story a mischmasch. (Carroll joke intended) Some puppet characters were fun, but not the main ones.

What really hurts is that with all the cleverness of Henson, it couldn't have been too hard to find someone who could plumb the depths of, say Alice to support his need for a vision. Froud is a lightweight, Terry Jones is the least talented Pythonista. It seems they got these secondraters together and just brainstormed.

The failure of this film and 'Dark Crystal,' was rather universal and threw Henson into a chronic depression that eventually killed him. I can see 'Dark Crystal' being remade with new voices, a real score and a voiceover with a fuller story. Perhaps a frame, ala 'Princess Bride.' But this film just has nothing leveragable in my mind. Sorry.

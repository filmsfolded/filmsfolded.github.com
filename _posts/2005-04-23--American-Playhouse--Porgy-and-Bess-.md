This starts with what is now called the Black experience. From whatever the reality of that was, we (with the active help of bad blacks) have abstracted a highly romanticized notion, in the same manner we've burdened Native Americans.

From both the real and idealized emerged jazz, the real jazz. That was refined and incubated in the larger society to become the basis of American music. Out of that came Gershwin's music.

On that was built a stage show, an opera. From the opera was extended a TeeVee staging. And from that presentation, we are clearly intended to see the original layer, the real Black experience.

Well, that's a lot of translations, and few of them are done artfully and consciously. What we end up with is a jumble of visions, each coherent but chopped into discrete pits and served up as a stew.

You are forced to focus on any one level, be it the staging, the dive into the idealized society, the music, the performance, the images... The only way in my mind to get the best experience from Porgy is without images, because that's the only presentation that can be conceived and delivered as a coherent thing.

These images, this staging, these evocations of a society are rather clever and are interesting enough to keep your eye occupied. But they cannot engage your imagination.

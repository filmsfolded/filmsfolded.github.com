The setup is simple. We are voyeurs watching a woman whose job it is to watch surveillance cameras. She gets engaged with a specific subject, leaving the camera and entering the reality. We do as well, but the reason she does so is held in tension as a mystery. She clearly is repulsed while simultaneously attracted, but things take a very long time. By the end, you learn why. 

But for nearly two hours, because you are folded into this, you suffer the incredible loss this woman has. She knows what that loss is, but you do not, which makes it ever the more effective. Because you can fill it in with the loss you know, and you can fall as deeply as you ever have.

It is a profound construction. Disturbing. Cinematic. Visual, Folded. 

I study redheads in film, and what they stand for. In Hollywood, the dynamic is different than in the UK. There, an overt racism overlays the thing: redheads are from Ireland, and the Irish are at the bottom of the social scale. "Gingers" are considered rare and alluring in the US, while in England there is a vile connotation. 

The guy here, the fellow we fear because he is so low class in this tattered landscape, he is a ginger. The road factors into the plot in a few different ways. Red does as well.

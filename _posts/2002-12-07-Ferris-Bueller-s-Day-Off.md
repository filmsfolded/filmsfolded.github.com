Spoilers herein.

John Hughes had made a few 'straight' teen movies before this: that's where the world of the movie -- though abstract -- is to be taken at face value. The actors actually try to play their characters, in fact Hughes generally tries to find actors that already are those characters.

But he tried something else with Molly Ringwald starting with 'Breakfast Club' where he cast her 'against type.' Much of that film depended on a notion of acting to be someone else. Here he takes the next step, this time with Broderick. And this time, he gets a seasoned, self-aware actor.

This time, the story is not about teen angst associated with self-identity, but about the joy of the con. The pleasures of being someone else (which is all most kids have anyway). Broderick's stage experience before this was all in roles where he winked at the audience: 'See what I do.' A couple years later, Bruce Willis would reintroduce this style of acting to the big picture, but here we have it early.

The tip-off is those moments when Ferris -- or is it Broderick? -- looks straight at you and tells you about the role he is playing: Broderick playing a role of a kid who is playing a role. We have the 'Mr Peterson' bit; the 'sausage king' bit; the performance in the parade; the fake-in-the-bed bit (shades of 'Home Alone'), the sick six year old bit; and finally the actor telling us to just go home. Its all acting about acting: a teen's life is all about adopting a persona.

Today, this seems normal, but in its time, it was pretty revolutionary film for a mainstream product. Its the reason this is remembered so fondly, because for many youngsters -- those who never learn to read intelligently -- it was the first encounter with reflexive art. (The previous generation got their's from the Beatles and Dylan.) I'm not sure what teen film predecessors there could be, but this may be where the whole explosion of non-ironic irony in teen films comes from.

That redhead Stephanie Blake character is important. Look for her.

Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

Spoilers herein.

This is the sixth or seventh in the series that I have seen. BBC has a policy of putting  different creative crew in charge of each one, so they vary significantly. I found the  'Alien' and 'Batman' franchises to be a mini-lesson in film techniques, and this is a lot  like that.

Usually, the Marple crews use BBC or TeeVee conventions and shoehorn in the unusual  conventions of Christie, which themselves vary from story to story. Here, the adapter and  director have actually paid attention to the manner in which is the story is presented in  the book.

The book has the hotel as a character: the walls carry personality and act as a sort of  Moriarity. It is contrived. The director cleverly uses this; the camera always locates itself  as part of the architecture first. It both contains and observes the characters. The pans  are inhuman. They reflect Maples' nature: nosey, skulking.

On top of this, everything is perceived with dull colors, as if the film itself was a copy of  Bertram's: an obsessively maintained antique.

There is a physicality to the end that reflects that of this story's Moriarty.

This is probably the best of the Hickson Marples.

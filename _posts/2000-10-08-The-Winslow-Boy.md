Two interesting things about this film. Mamet usually overdelivers. But with his Vanya and this play, both adaptations, he explores subtle layering. What the layering concerns is the second point. But the fashion of the layering in this case is extreme understatement. One can see where Mamet is experimenting to see how far he can go, and that's not too enjoyable, since the mechanics of writing show. He was masterful with Vanya. Here, he tries too hard.

But the point of the play is very fine. Here we have yet another film about acting. The event which gets the wheel turning is a young boy who lies about his guilt. (His guilt is never really in doubt as the overwhelming evidence is presented...

Spoiler ahead! ...and he is acquitted in an OJ-like confabulation of legal tricks. This is why the British public was so upset.)

But never mind that the boy is acting. Or that his father is pretending to believe in the family's honor. Or never mind the other minor Victorian deceits (that the maid pretends to not know of her impending dismissal, the black sheep son pretends to not despise his father, or that the soldier pretends to love his fiance.)

No, this film is about the lawyer/lord. Jeremy Northam is perfect. He never believes in the boy's innocence. He is one artifice laid on top of another. He lies to his friend about a judgeship knowing the confidence will be shared with the woman he is toying with. His entire behavior in chambers and the house is an act. The last scene which is superficially lovely is actually an escalation of the artifice.

Northam pulls this off well. He lets us know at root he is Northam the actor, playing Mamet's lord, who is an elaboration of the original play's character, who in turn represented a very real person. But because that person was a Victorian, he himself was false. As with Vanya, the point of the play is to allow the actor to weave in and out of these layers. Northam is perfect, I say again.

One cannot get so excited about the female foil. When will directors ever learn not to direct the people they sleep with? She smiles well. How vapid in comparison to Northam's locomotive.

I went on a binge, watching all four of the first Universal Frankenstein movies. I know that many believe "Metropolis" to be the first mad scientist movie. But that wasn't about science or scientists, but about repressive society. The "science" there was actually technology and had as much to do with things as the devices in "1984." 

This, this, I think is the first movie where the whole point was that science was inerrently evil in its tendencies. Its different than a Faust story, where powers were conveyed for selfish ends; here the ends are discovery. Its no mistake that there's the heavy hand of religion in the village context that surrounds the man and his work.

So when I watch these, I pay attention to two things. One is how science is portrayed. Its radically different in all four. And the second is how the cinematic grammar is used to present that notion. Its a sort of hobby of mine to compare sequels and remakes.

In this first one, the scientist believes that if he understands how life works, he can heal the sick. He is a doctor, a medical doctor and studying what wouldn't be out of the ordinary today or even then. Only the experiment was unusual and grisly, messing with corpses, but even that isn't very far from ordinary. 

Science, and especially mathematics is extremely cinematic to the people doing it, but I know of few films that seem to capture it well. The cinematic path seems to be through technological gizmo's, and I think we have Whales to thank for that. The lightning business wasn't central in the book, I do not think. So it is something of genius to choose all those flying, vertical, sparking things. You can sense the energy. Its literally light, and the motif of light and dark in several literal and metaphoric threads throughout works with that.

Tod Browning was working in parallel, but his world was not one of man bringing light to darkness, but the other way around: the forces of darkness (and so called in the film) bringing darkness to mere humans.

This is not an evil man.

Margaret O'Brien has earned her place in movieland heaven so far as I am concerned. 

What I do is keep track of important films, but I might as well be keeping track of important scenes instead. If I were, one of these would be the Halloween prank scene for "Meet Me in St Louis," which is all about this child. In that film, the sweetness and prancing makes a bit more sense than the treacly noble womanchild we have here.

But you just cannot watch this without thinking of that, made only a few weeks later. 

The movie itself is a combination of three things: a story about cowardice made during wartime. All US and UK movies were part of the war effort, absolutely. It also has large room for Laughton to strut about and show us that he is an actor of the old Wilkes Booth tradition. Huffing and puffing.

I'll ask you to ignore those parts. They aren't fun.

The third part is the O'Brien part, the simple joy of a child sunnily presented. This girl so exceeded Shirley Temple that I wish we had more of her before she burned out.

I saw this the same night I saw the Narnia movie (2005) and the night after the 88 version. Oh, what those needed was this critter!

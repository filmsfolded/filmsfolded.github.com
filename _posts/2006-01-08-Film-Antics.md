This little "one reeler" is pretty transparent. It has one excellent thing in it and the rest filler, filler from cute kids and a few baby animals.

That one thing is pretty interesting. It films three year olds watching a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon. (MGM owns both T&amp;J and this thing.)

As the segment of the cartoon places Jerry in peril, the kids are truly concerned. Aghast. They want to do something. They care.

We are meant to be charmed by their openness and innocence. But what it prompts is a whole series of rich and disturbing questions. Why should be charmed by watching terror? Will this be among the last time these humans will care? Why do we make torture cartoons in the first place? And what is MGM's agenda here?

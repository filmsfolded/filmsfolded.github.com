I rewatched this recently with "Ghostbusters." This did not age well, while the other did.

I think the reason has something to do with how it was targeted. In projects like this, you have to decide the lever that is first, with others in support. That primary level is playing with the notion of cool. Its fairly reliable, easy to do and rich with comic possibilities. The monsters and story and all that are merely support. 

The problem is that coolness gets stale quickly. So while all the secondary machinery here is still working, the core that this depends on has disappeared. 

The interesting thing in watching this now, is wondering about what has changed. It is that 9-11 has transformed these "alien threat -- government watchdog" has ruined this topic for humor? Torture colors everything.

Is it because these two actors have ruined their brand, drifted away from what we need for this?

Is it because the expectations for what works is such a quickly evolving target that all the films that have mined this since have made this obsolete?

Probably its all of these.

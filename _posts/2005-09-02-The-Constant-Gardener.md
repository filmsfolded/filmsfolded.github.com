In my comment for "City of God" I remarked on the fine architecture of the thing. There were three stories, each with its own camera consciousness. The three battled it out for control of your mind, the struggle among three gods.

This isn't a new idea, in fact Meirelles borrowed the notion from Kubrick's "2001" and the idea reborn in "Blue Velvet." But the camera personalities had to do with the personal blur of the hand-held, the rhythm of the hand holding it and moving with the action.

Because it had these three consciousnesses, these three rhythms, it had both a local and global texture. It assured me that this was yet another of the fine Latin and Latin American filmmakers that have our imagination in their hands.

That's why this movie is a huge disappointment. Oh, it has the same sense of place -- perhaps even better. And it has the same rhythm as one of the "God" cameras: theatrically after a hasty documentary style that seems intensely personal.

It really is effective, especially in the part that runs between the flashforward of the overturned car at the beginning and where it appears in the story. That segment of the movie is all about setting us up for what we expect will be an intricate puzzle. So we study the blurs as we are swept along in that first part, just as the characters are.

The very same technique was used in "The Good Thief" where the camera and editing was in snippets that were briefer and blurs that were faster than we could really process. But in "Thief" there really was a puzzle, some unusual twists, Some surprises.

In this case, the story plods along. Did we ever doubt that the drug companies were the bad guys? Did we not expect the British government to be in cahoots? Were you unsure that the distressed husband would win and the designated villain suffer?

Worse, Meirelles decided to abandon his engineering of rhythms. The thing is pretty much the same from beginning to end. Instead of the shooting, editing and eye, he chose to switch color filters instead. I suppose that is because the financiers wanted what they probably call "intelligent energy" to judge from their press material.

And he has mixed in some really banal shots. Sweeping helicopter shots are common now, especially the smooth encirclings that pull out and show the players in a huge context. But those shots are from such a different cinematic consciousness as the rest it looks as if they were pasted on by the studio behind the director's back.

But he has to take the blame for how the attack on the village is staged. By this time, the story is a grind. We have seen the beauty and grime. We have gotten the point about injustice and exploitation. We know precisely the trajectory of our hero. This is just the place where we should be surprised by some new cinematic trick, where the "energy" would get pumped up.

Iñárritu would have done this, God bless him. What we get here is straight out of a 1940s western. Injuns silhouetted against the sky as they come over the ridge. Galloping copied from "Magnificent 7" instead of even the original.

From there, the movie enters a mode that is half Hollywood drek (the missing letter read at the funeral) and half manufactured intelligent doom, love manifested in death.

I wish I could be as excited about this as I was with "City" and as I leaned into the first part of this.

We needed more of Weisz (what a surprise!) of Meirelles and texture, and less of Le Carre and Fiennes.

The two parts don't mix.

Spoilers herein.

Nichole made a very bad choice here. This was apparently a last minute schedule filler after she backed out of 'Panic Room.'

Here we have a common situation, a weak director -- no coherent vision. Usually, these make for very interesting experiences when you involve a strong actor. That actor fills in all the space the director cannot see, giving an 'invisible' performance. In fact, I use it as a test for whether an actor goes on my list to follow no matter the project.

Nichole fails this test, and that's a shame after 'Moulin Rouge!' in which she gives a multilevel performance (as the character, as the actor, as the character acting). Plus, the theory of Australian dramatic training is an attractive one, since so many of our multidimensionally capable actresses come from there. And when someone reaches this level of celebrity, it is fun to speculate on how she reinvents sex roles.

More: the actor's dream is to act characters who are acting, as is the case here. But in this thin film, what Nichole contributes is thin as well. There is no glimmer of a full inhabitation of the role. There is no annotative reflection. There is less life inside than what she shows.

Contrast this with a similarly confused film, 'Bandits,' that features her colleague, Cate Blanchett. This is a loose collection of episodes that the director doesn't control, and has the additional problem of two muggers as her costars. See how Cate completely understands where the director and other actors are and are not. See how she uses that stage to create a parallel role behind everyone's back but in such a way that we the viewer can see it. See how similar the form of this stolen role is to the explicit form that Nichole uses in 'Rouge!' See how Nichole does none of that here.

I suspect Nichole is better than this, but needs confidence or something. Let's hope she gets what she needs.

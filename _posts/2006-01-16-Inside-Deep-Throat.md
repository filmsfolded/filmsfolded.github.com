"Deep Throat" is an incompetent movie that had a phenomenal effect. So I guess it is appropriate that a documentary on some of those effects be less than competent as well.

Here's the interesting thing. No one should live without understanding a few basic things about themselves. Film is a large factor in how we imagine and define ourselves. "Deep Throat" is an influential film. But it isn't worth watching, indeed watching it gives you no insight into its importance.

So we needed something like this. I just wish the enormity of the effect of "Deep Throat" would justify an appropriately well constructed documentary. 

The problem with this thing is that are lots of stories: the story of the mob and obscene profits; the story of the birth of the porn industry; the story of the mainstreaming of fellatio; the story of Linda and another of Harry.

And then there's the story of the rise of the religious right in politics, and the freezing of political positions on both sides at comical forms based on nearterm tactics of the moment. And how celebrities and power brokers picked sides in the accidental divide this caused.

Finally, you have what didn't happen. Overt sex hasn't entered mainstream cinema. 

Any of these would make a good documentary, and be a heavy challenge for a talented documentarian. All of these are tossed together here as if they were all the same story. None is explored beyond being merely mentioned.

I hope someone does better some time.

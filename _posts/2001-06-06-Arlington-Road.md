Spoilers herein.

What do I have to do to convince you?

This film was made by a large, disciplined conspiracy to lull the American people into complacency.

Oh, it is all so clever. Instead of denying that they exist, they portray themselves in an improbable context, with exaggeration and directorial naivete. This way, the unsuspecting viewer becomes literally unsuspecting because we class all such stuff with Schwarzenegger improbabilities, idle amusements. The conspirators are played by comics. That way the real conspiracy disappears.

So clever these people. But we are not so stupid!

Spoilers herein.

The beauty of IMDB commenting is that we don't have to go through all the stuff that others do: here, it is the inevitable 'Pulp Fiction' comparisons, even though so far no one has touched on the time folding and suspended end.

This leaves us free to mention what is probably the real driver of the script, at least from the filmmaker's perspective. There are two kinds of films, roughly speaking. The 'ordinary' kind deals with characters and situations, using film as an invisible mechanism. The other type acknowledges the fact that we all (makers and viewers) know it is a film and incorporate all sorts of additional devices.

Mazursky has made a living by carving out a territory between these, a territory shared with John Sayles and Steven Soderbergh who each take quite a different approaches. Mazursky's basic approach is the common dramatic stance of defining characters and allowing them to interact within some contrivance. He is a favorite of actors, and is an actor himself. The unique twist he brings is the superficial recognition of the medium. It is superficial because it is never exploited for effect as true reflected films are. Its just there as an acknowledgment that unlike many of his actor peers he knows there are the two types, but makes the choice for 'purity.'

So we have Mazursky projects which actually feature filmmakers or are based on books in an acknowledge but not exploited manner. Now we have a disciple of Mazursky that does the same. The setup is Altmanesque, not at all like the self-referential Tarantino. In 'Two Days' (I only saw 24 hours, I thought) the whole exercise is supposedly interesting characters bumping up against each other. And in the midst is Mazursky himself! Playing an actor/filmmaker, but in a way that interacts with the story with no more importance than if he were a hairdresser. The dogs literally matter more. But there are plenty of jokes about the incomprehensibility of his films: the part about the elephant.

Because the focus is on the characters, and because all the characters are drawn from archetypes, we have the expected redhead -- here Glenne Headly.

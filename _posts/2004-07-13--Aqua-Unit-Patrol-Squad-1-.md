Spoilers herein.

The game of animation is in large measure a matter of moving further and further into  abstract universes. The game of modern movies is a matter of folding along self-referential  dimensions. 

The rate of abstraction has been pushed pretty far, from Beavis to South Park to the  contenders today. The whole game is a matter of treating previous cartoons (and other  cartoon-like abstractions in life) like cartoons (like Bugs Bunny) used to treat real life.

This is a fold on the nature of crime fighters, of science fiction, of even the basic character of  characters. Doing it once is a matter of high art. Doing essentially the same thing over and  over is the very target of the thing.

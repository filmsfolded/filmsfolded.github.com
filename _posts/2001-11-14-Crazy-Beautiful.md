Spoilers herein.

IMDB is pretty informative sometimes. Check out the user rating demographics to see what Dunst's appeal is: Females under 18 and Males over 45!

This is the same story as Romeo and Juliet plus a gazillion others. The vapid story  here isn't what's interesting, rather the attempt to leverage the innate acting ability and dramatic energy of Latino adolescents.

High school kids aren't real, instead they choose a part to play -- usually from a small selection. Latino boys have a comparatively exaggerated sense of display in their roles. The funny thing is that this production purports to be 'real,' but does so by allowing us to see the act. But only in the first part and less well than 'Save the Last Dance.'

But it is spontaneous and energetic in spots thanks to Dunst. We still have to see whether she will live up to her promise in 'Little Women,' and the under-rated 'Dick.' Here she is appealing but only by using simple tricks. This could have been a worthwhile film if she had been better directed, if Carlos wasn't so perfect, if the tone wasn't so schizo, if suicide wasn't treated like a cramp, if it had the edge of an R instead of being so chopped up, and if it didn't have that Disney ending.

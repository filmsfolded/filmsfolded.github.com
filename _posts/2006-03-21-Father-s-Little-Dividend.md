This is a horrid little thing. It is ugly, like the baby that was incomprehensibly chosen to stand for cute.

Here are the problems.

First, it is uncinematic. It isn't a movie at all, just a bunch of skits strung together under the umbrella of a father who is grumpy and then becomes fondly engaged.

It has Spencer Tracy, a bad actor in any context, here recalling his Jekyll and Hyde faces. It has Liz trying her best to find a person in the cartoonish script. And the good witch of Oz as the shrewish mother in law?

And it has one of the clumsiest plot fulcrums I know. The granddad takes the baby for a walk, gets engaged in a soccer game and forgets the baby, who is gone on his return. We then see a frantic comic search, ending in the police office. It isn't funny. None of this is, and watching it will damage your cinematic psyche.

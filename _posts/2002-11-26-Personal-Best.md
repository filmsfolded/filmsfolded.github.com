Spoilers herein.

We have to take this seriously, because it comes from the writer of some of the best films in history. But he has directed only a few projects, and he knows enough to keep them cardboard cutout simple. Sports and sex competitors for the soul in the real world, but Towne's world is a fantasy world where any set of powerful forces can be contrived to bump up against one another.

So he started with these two forces, obviously selected for their cinematic power. The lesbian angle is unusual enough (in mainstream cinema terms) to bind the two. Everything else follows: the bodies, the 'real' bisexual athlete. It's illustrative to me to perceive what this man does get and what he doesn't.

Obviously, he understands that passion, and sex, and bodies (though not necessarily related here) sell. Towne also understands what it means to have a talented cinematographer, someone who can put a little energy into the outing. He also turns the natural blond into a redhead. He understand film iconography all right.

What he misses is the plain fact that situation falls outside that misty world of film romance we allow ourselves to accept without question. We don't blindly accept it and look for 'reasons' where we wouldn't if it were any other kind of relationship. And finding the reasons artificial, we chuck the whole thing.

I personally didn't mind Mariel's lack of art. I'm increasingly appreciating the placement of actors in roles where the deficiency of the person matches that of the character.

Spoilers herein.

Kwai meets Dirty Dozen meets Shawshank meets Great Escape and is far far below any of them.

I suppose this movie will do well because it features a flag and contains some vague notion of soldiers' honor. But it in fact debases both.

The primary problem is Redford. He knows his way around a set, and he has a familiar, reassuring face. Problem is he can't act, and certainly can't deliver what is needed here: a man who carries a whole world in the air around him, a man whose presence exudes authority. Lindo easy conveys this feel; nothing Redford tries, does. It is as comical as the girl always falling for Woody Allen.

Worse: the mind of the warfighter has some very specific mental mannerisms, some attractive, some not. No one involved in this film seems to have bothered to discover these.

I am at a particular disadvantage: I viewed this in an audience heavily populated by the real thing. Plus the last film I saw was 'The Interview,' which also featured a battle of wits between a jailer and prisoner. It was leagues beyond this.

A chess note: I believe the original story must have made much of the chess metaphor: the wall, the faceoff between the two, the supposedly deep anticipative strategies, constraints of the military command structure. If so, it would have been blunt and rather obvious but at least some coherent center. Here it is so watered down that studio execs must have been afraid of even this small grain of sophistication.

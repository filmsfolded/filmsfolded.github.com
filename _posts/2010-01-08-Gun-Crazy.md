This isn't noir, not by the definition I use. You need to have an external force implicitly controlled by the audience that plays caprice with random people. The girl is usually a bridge between the world of the character-guy and the world of the gods.

This does have a tragic force, but it is a different beast altogether -- a conventional tragedy fueled by flaws in the two characters. This never happens in noir.

The guy is obsessive about guns. The moll is compulsive for thrills, explaining it to herself as want of money. They bring down everything because if this. The two are expert marksmen.

I think that the writer -- hampered by the code as he was -- wrote around the elements that he wanted to have, using the guns to stand for drugs and sex. This is pretty much a waste except for the scene in which our two lovers meet and immediately fall in love. She puts on a "crown" with six matches sticking out. She allows him -- who she has never met -- to shoot at the ends of these matches to light them. (I cannot imagine such precision with a handgun.)

He does light all the matches. It is a thrilling scene -- not particularly well photographed. But the idea is thrilling. His gun ignites her and we can experience it cinematically. All the rest is relatively bad writing.

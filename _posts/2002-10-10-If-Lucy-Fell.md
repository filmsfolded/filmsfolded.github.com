Spoilers herein.

I sought this film because I was impressed with 'One Night at McCools.' That project had flaws, mostly related to the poor acting and production values. but I thought the vision behind it was clever, and in line with some admirable projects. 

But the vision behind this project is pretty cookiecutter. Its a quite serious attempt at the primary formula for a date movie, made worse for missing the mark because it came whole form one guy's mind.

But it had some clever elements: Ben Stiller as a painter who literally throws himself into his work, clearly the alterego of Schaeffer. That's fun if you know Stiller. Its something like his 'Mystery Men' character. Another element is the Beatles reference. Lots of writers my age are using them, from 'Vanilla Sky' to 'I Am Sam.' Here, the target is the famous 'Lucy in the Sky,' which is great fun if you know what's behind the song. Otherwise, it is a long dreary march to the end.

The notion of stealing a narrative from spying (as Joe does to the Elle character) has some promise too. Squandered, alas.

Film often reflects its era, or recalls one. Viewers often cite the 30s or forties as the best example, but for my money that honor belongs to many projects in the early seventies, attempting to recall the already dying ethos of the late sixties. I'm browsing through a number of these right now. Many never made it big because they tried so hard to evoke the feel of the time. 

This is a great example. It is set on an island so as be more abstract, and it casts the societal difference in an oddly stark metaphor: religion. Through this we have two incongruous threads: some reference to promiscuity which we are meant to see as linked to the paganism. Well, it _was_ linked to what the paganism stands for in the movie, but the connection is too thin. 

For instance, in one episode, our hapless detective (who is at a loss to understand what it is going on) stumbles on a woman in a bath. Her pose is stylized as if to say: movie nudity here. The heavy lifting in this department is by Ms. Britt, whose scenes are similarly artificial, not linked to anything we see, just stuff that we evoke from the 60s.

The second odd thread is the twist at the end, which is both clever and cinematic. The "folding" in this case could have been rather profound (the viewer as the sacrifice), if the dynamics of the era, and the metaphor of the film's detective as viewer had been better drawn.

Spoilers herein.

Movies are a con  their job is to fool us into believing, into buying into a story. A common film type involves cons in the story. That way, we get to see actors acting characters that are actors. This way, you can have a folded narrative where the characters and actors are doing more or less the same thing.

Common on stage as well, this form gets really powerful when on or both layers involve sex. There is a very precise place for this script on the family tree of drama. Most of the other productions understand this, and tantalize the viewer with sex and sexual witticisms in the narrative.

This one tries to be more of an Oscar Wilde play, where the complications and confusions themselves are the interest rather than the game itself.

That means that the characters must matter, something not originally intended. So poor misses Uma and Michelle need to grind away with every trick they have to try to engage. They have some appeal, but they are not strong enough to create a character that grabs us. They are as empty as poor Keanu.

So we are left with Glenn and John to grab us. They know how and do, sortof. But it doesn't work because that's not what the story was constructed to accomplish.

Watch 'Baby of Macon' instead for this type of folding if you want sexual cons that grab.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3  Has some interesting elements

Sometimes its a joy rummaging around in the old Hal Roach and Mack Sennett comedies. There's an assumption behind the humor that by itself is rewarding: physical stuff and often heartfelt goodness.

But sometimes they fall into sour recall, the times not being so forgiving of the humor of pain and embarrassment. This is one that won't make you laugh. You won't cry either, but it will make you sad, knowing the unfair fate Arbuckle would suffer later.

But even beyond that it isn't a success. Its actually a pretty tragic story with some pratfalls, and not very good or broad ones.

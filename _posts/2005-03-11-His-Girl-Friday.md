I'm not normally a fan of Hawks, but he's done some very clever engineering here. And I'm not a Grant enthusiast, though I appreciate his sense of timing. Here, he's completely out of his element. His strength is in a laconic delay. In this case, the presentation is dependent on a crackling speed, a rush, a pushed delivery with overlapping snappy dialog. So he feels stilted, worrying too much about his delivery to be comfortable. Russell is perfect.

The overlapping is in several dimensions, and that's the charm. One dimension is the overlapping dialog and intent. Another is the story (the film) about the story (the report) about the story (the murder).

It is a now common trick: make three layers instead of the normal two: in this case a passionately made story about a passionately made story. Then the more the characters invest in getting into their story, the more we invest into getting into ours. That's why we dig ourself into this freight train.

Be aware that there is an offensive racist joke.

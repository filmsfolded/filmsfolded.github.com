I am hoping the viewing of this movie will end a week of viewing films with bad, even execrable philosophy. But I just couldn't avoid this. It was a big film and based on a best seller, an enormously good seller and an influential book.

For decades, it was the standard path for a college freshman to read this and imagine himself "different." Probably still the case in Texas. The ideas here are hardly original, but they are presented so boldly and with such panache that the author has spawned countless political religious movements in the US. Misguided kids thinking they were geniuses as measured by the degree of rejection by society began doing nothing but court rejection. Individuality as selfishness became a value, but the definition of what it means to be "individual" became so standardized that whole industries now sell goods to support you in your endeavor to be yourself, be different.

And that's true of film as well, how many of them now use commercial formulas to advise being different.

I suppose a case can be made for respecting greatness, and another for striving for genius. But this particular presentation is so bogus it undercuts these ideas at every turn. (Disclaimer: I am an architect.)

This movie chooses architecture, possibly the worst example. A writer or any artist would be better. A filmmaker even better because it is an expensive, collaborative endeavor.

But architecture is unique among all the clever things in the world. (These days architecture includes inventing conceptual spaces as well.)

This movie makes the mistake that architecture is somehow equivalent to sculpture, that what results are objects and not environments, that buildings are monuments and not experiences, that creativity somehow sticks to something once it is set free in the world.

It assumes that nothing the masses like can be true, that no observer (excepting a true love or a failed genius) can see greatness. But as I say, the definition of "individuality" is so unclever, so lacking in genius here, so predictable its laughable.

If you know the book, you'll guffaw at the writing, which is clearly by a nongenius, a non- special soul. You'll chafe at the way the "ideas" are sold, by wrapping them in a second rate bodice-ripping love tragedy that ends happily. Milk will come out of your nose when you see the designs displayed as genius, and individuality.

The one good thing that can be said of the book. It was written with a cinematic sensibility. That's why we have an architect. Architecture is cinematic, even on the page.

The girl who is won by the genius is pretty enough. Who would ever swallow these ideas and believe that a woman could be a prize?

Interesting as all getout to compare this to "Master and Commander." Both rely on a simple romantic fantasy about the British navy, that it was the gold standard of nobility, honor and related things. Each has an exemplary captain whose seamanship (and a bit of trickery) is a sort of embedded allegory for goodness.

So you have to do only two things to make the formula work. The first is to simply fill the puppet in a way that doesn't detract. I'm not a Gregory Peck fan, but he does well here because the character is supposed to be so cardboard, so simply constructed. Russell Crowe makes a huge mistake in trying to give his captain gravitas and depth. He's a better actor, but real acting doesn't fit the role.

The other thing to do is convey the daily business of the working and warring of the ship. And here, this movie is so superior in doing that, it makes one wonder. This director is a second-rater. The movie was made when special effects meant models. But it hits a groove that works.

It doesn't "put you there." I'm not even sure what that would be like. What it does do is give some idea of the choreographed action, the hurried routines, The commitment to task, even when the task gets chaotic around death. You feel that, the order and the death here. You didn't get close with the "Master and Commnader" project.

The bind is that these brothers know a few things about cinematic effect. But they lack enough passion to have a unique vision to serve as the soul of an important film, and they lack enough depth to really tell us something new, and they lack enough skill to reach the masters they copy.

I usually have lots of patience with apprentice stylists. For example, I think Figgis and Cronenberg are interesting and may do some important work some day.

But for some, as here and with 'Dark City,' I lose that patience. This is not cinema, it is movie posters.

Pantoliano has some whimsy. But that's not enough.

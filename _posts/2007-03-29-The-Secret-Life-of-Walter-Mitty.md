1965 saw the creation of a wonderful little film, "How to murder your wife," about a cartoonist whose cartoon overlaps with his life. It was a milestone of sorts in film history, spawning similar and more clever notions of all types.

So it was with some high expectations I sought out this film from 1947. It is from an idea of one of our foremost humorists, himself a cartoonist. There's supposed to be some relationship among the types of cartoons he draws, the fantasies he imagines and the "real" story in which he finds himself.

All three are presented, but there is a poor relationship made among them. It seems as if there are three or two quite unrelated movies that unroll at our feet. This is isn't a case of breaking Ted's law, where the fantasy within is the same "distance" as the film reality is to ours. Those layers exist here in the appropriate place.. They're just not stitched together. It seems as if a second screenwriter came on the scene and took out some important connective tissue, replacing it with unrelated comedic effects. 

The whole thing flops. If you find yourself in it, pay attention to the dreams. In many of them (most?), he starts out in one role and moves to another.

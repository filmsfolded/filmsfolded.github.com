Spoilers herein.

A film about a book about writing, and in particular the writing that book. Further, about the pain of being a writer when the target of life is the passion of narrative.

This story is about a man who needs to create something that makes sense emotionally. He engages in an affair which gives sense and life to both his life and the 'sense' he is cobbling together for the book. The book gets stressed when the affair does, and that stress turns out to be the new matter for a better, different book.

This is a rather complex film because of all the layers involved, and serves as a real eyeopener about how sophisticated the viewing audience has become. The layers come from just what is 'reality' that is the context within which the book is written, and what is the subject of the book. We see both, apparently undifferentiated.

This would have fallen flat, like say the similar 'Mansfield Park,' were it not for Julianne. I continue to be amazed at her ability to populate multiple layers of the narrative at the same time. Here, she plays the muse, the passionate victim, the fictional character, the schemer creating the whole mess, the representative of all the layers: the book, the context and reason for the book and the life outside the book.

Much of the direction competently understands this and accommodates. There's nothing notable other than that: respect for the richness of the material and the ability of Moore to make it live.

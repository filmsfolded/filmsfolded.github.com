Rob Reiner was somebody we were rooting for. Like Richie Cunningham, he was a character we were taught to like through weekly contact in a culturally suggestive context. Then he went out and made films, and at first they were spectacularly good. Not good in a dramatic or cinematic sense so much as the way in which they got the balance right with humor and storytelling. They don't have the same power now, but a couple of those films from the 80s were ripe, perfect gems.

And then society folded itself into more complex ledges from which to look at itself, and Carl's son remained frozen where he was. In retrospect, he was frozen where his dad was. I can think of nothing more damning to say of a success.

Well, he isn't a success any more. His notions about what's between real truth and ideal perspective are so far off, the effect is to remind us that society is crumbling. There really are people who cling to the thin notions this film builds on. Except there isn't much building; its straight out of the bottle.

Its all tired. One good director too tired to learn the new world. One great actor who gave up long ago and now merely borrows from his past. Another actor who never had it, and admits that he is too lazy to do anything but be the same nice guy -- and narrate himself through a role. The story is a thin one: redemption.

Freeman's character was almost written interestingly, his estrangement from his family a matter of unappreciated sacrifice. But its only written into the side. There's no real redemption here, because there are no real characters, only tired actors. Since we know they are not redeemed, cannot be, the project dies.

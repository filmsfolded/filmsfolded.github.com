I wish I had seen the original, longer version. Even as it is, I was surprised at how ambitious a project this is.

Gallo is an actor that believes it possible for the nature of a character to animate a story even when the story isn't revealed conventionally. So what he does is give us a couple hours of just looking at him so we can infer the story, or at least the effect of the story. Only at the end are we told what this was all about.

The story -- at least the presented version -- is that our boy gave his pregnant girlfriend a chocolate bunny on which they gorged. She then got high (and incidentally gangraped) and choked on the brown bunny and died. Our man imagines/dreams her visiting his motel room, where he gives her a metaphorical brown bunny.

That's when we learn that nothing we have seen is to be trusted. Likely, even the fact that he is a motorcycle racer is in question; only the aimlessness of his path is likely. Women-centric events are shown, all based on a Beatrix Potter - Peter Rabbit notion of him visiting Alice's flower garden: Lilly, Rose, Violet and Daisy.

In the first: he visits Daisy's mother, who he lived next door to. She both doesn't recall him and owns a brown bunny. The second is the sequence that made this for me. He encounters a woman sitting outside and has a near wordless mini-encounter with her that packed years of a relationship into a couple minutes. (The similar fantasy sequence in "Buffalo 66" is when Christina Ricci does a "Big Lebowski" inspired dance in a bowling alley.)

The woman he works with in this sequence is Cheryl Tiegs who gives the performance of the year. I wish I knew what Gallo said to her.

I know a fair amount about cinematic conventions, meaning here the visual vocabulary. It is surprisingly narrow, limited more by the ability of a viewer to read a film than by the ability to experiment. Even a small advance is something to savor. 

In this case, the simple situation of the narrative (machinist, human, death) plus a pseudo French tone, plus a Bertolucci based approach from music videos gives us some new, welcome visual texture. 

It is all about textures, patterns, static backgrounds -- frequently shown as paths and tunnels -- against which the foreground personalities move, so constrained. There are only four characters, two men, conspirators, and two women. A fifth presence in the form of a village priest is our on screen surrogate watcher. 

The construction is not masterful, bit it is ambitious. There is a deliberate attempt to have the background patterns have agent parity, to be able to dictate, to cause. The mapping is made through a rather blunt metaphor, precision gunsmithery. We literally watch Clooney's character make a state of the art weapon using (in part) discarded auto parts. 

This conflation of image, patterned background, human precision in patterning, all as faces of a noir cosmos is pure Nabokov. Lest we miss this, there are copious butterfly references, including a butterfly/whore image.

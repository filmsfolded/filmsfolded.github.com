Spoilers herein.

Russ Meyer has just died, with accompanying hoopla about his art and influence.

Maybe. But in the realm of porn, this guy Gary Graver may be the most interesting of the lot. For those who don't know, he was Orson Welles' collaborator on his final project. Though unfinished, it promised to be every bit as advanced as 'Kane' or Welles' Othello. I've criticized Graver's exploitation of the relationship elsewhere, but in terms of his work you've got to give him credit. This is a project he wrote, directed and shot.

This film is actually pretty intelligent. Sure, it is porn. As porn, it seems comparatively pretty well intentioned. But consider it as a film that has porn in it.

'Folded' film is film that references itself. The basic technique involves a play within the play, hearkening back to 'Hamlet' where such a thing literally happens. Welles didn't invent this in film, but he is considered the master of narrative folding.

What we have here is a teenager watching a show. That show is two stewardesses next door who dress up in silly costumes for sexual romps. The teen lives with his aunt, who becomes concerned about his withdrawal and hires a tutor/psychologist. She does so on the recommendation of an ad she watches on TeeVee about sexual awareness.

While she watches, the man in the TeeVee comes through the screen and they couple. So she hires this woman 'teacher,' and leaves town. Sure enough, the teen is 'taught,' eventually joins the stewardesses, and finally has a tryst with his aunt and a curious neighbor. The fold is that he is in a porn show that watches a porn show that he then enters. So does his aunt in a parallel thread. 

Think I'm seeing things? Consider this: the one and only lesson the teacher gives (short of the physical one) is to quote Shakespeare. Now, there are many, many Shakespearean passages that deal with lust, sex and romance, but this passage deals with something far deeper. It is the instruction Hamlet gives to the players of the play within the play. It is the very touchstone of folding in film. It blew my socks off.

The passage is Hamlet advising his actors to be passionate but not so much so that it seems fakey. So it is doubly apt. Shakespeare appears again as the teacher leaves. Again from Hamlet, it is the passage where he mentions his 'incest couch' which he shares with his mother. Then - back in the story - our teen indulges in incest.

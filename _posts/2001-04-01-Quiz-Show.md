Spoilers herein.

Redford is not a man with imagination. And he has a tendency toward preachiness. He tries here to be preachy (the public's biases for Redford-like waspishness), misses and accidentally creates a very good film.

That's because the writer used a solid idea: a film about lying in film (here TeeVee), a story about panderings which itself panders.

And also because there are some great performances. These are not great in the actor sense, but great in the cinematic sense. And Redford gets credit for motivating and focusing these folks to project into the visual narrative. Scofield and Turturro have Fiennes always done this. Scorsese sure knows what this is all about. Fiennes is not natural at this -- he tends to project into the audience -- but is carried along by the others. Morrow is supposed to stand out as one of us, so no problem there.

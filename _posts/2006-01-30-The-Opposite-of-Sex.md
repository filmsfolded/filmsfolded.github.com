I admit, I readily get caught in movies, even the most incompetent ones. I laugh and more importantly I cry when I'm supposed to. I am a sucker. In fact, I have laughed and cried with Roos' other projects, swept along as per design.

But this movie is different, and it pushed past the ordinary barriers I establish for movie life, barriers I didn't even know were there.

Here's the setup: we have a movie, with love and events and discovery just like any other movie. There actually are characters and some pithy engagement among them and with us. But thats only the excuse for the filmmaker to have a completely separate dialog with us. The movie is the excuse for that dialog, though sometimes the higher level of engagement between us and Roos will borrow from the story.

He is, in fact, having a sort of sex with us at the same time he tells us its the opposite, a different sort of attraction and seduction.

Roos' surrogate is Ricci in voice-over narration. It is the very best she has been, except for that bowling alley scene in "Buffalo." Since she isn't a great acting talent, what this means is that the role is a perfect fit for her sort of sexual detachment.

The narration starts out commenting on the movie, telling us what kind of movie this is not, and how we cannot expect her to behave as if she were in a movie. She leaves home and steals a gun. While doing so, she tells us to pay attention, that the gun will prove significant. Then, she deliciously shifts back into character and says that's foreshadowing and we studied that in school.

This is pretty shocking stuff, this shift out of the movie, using moviedom's most intimate trick, the internal noir narrative that starts such films. We immediately have a bond with this girl, but in her role outside the movie. As the movie rolls on, she bonds intimately with many characters, and each is an opportunity for us to readjust the relationship we have with her outside. 

It is sex, no it is the opposite of sex, at least movie sex. But it is attraction as strong. And when it goes wrong, as it must, it is devastating. We know how to have movie sex, but few of us seem to have any dexterity with these things outside of movies.

And that's the point. I guess we can thank Hal Hartley from paving the way for this.

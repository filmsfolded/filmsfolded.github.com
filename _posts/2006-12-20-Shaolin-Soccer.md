All movies are about other movies, but it is something else when the whole point of a movies is to make that explicit.

If you just come to this superficially, you'll have fun. It bends and borrows from other genres. Some funny bits are simple and formulaic, but they are surrounded by other comic bits that derive from deep introspection and self-awareness. I'm convinced that this is among the most powerful sources of humor, and it works here.

This isn't the type of reference that, say "Scary Movie" uses, where an external film is used as a sort of amusing costume. This is more like a high school girl's adoption of prepackaged persona, shifting from one to the other, investing as much of self as is available. 

Its no joke... which is the joke.

I thought "Kung Fu" was much better at this, more natural and a bit less seamless. But where this one is superior is in how the camera participates. There are many shots in here that start out in a conventional stance: eye height, focused on an individual, and then smoothly swoop up to reveal a context. Usually there is a revolving shift associated with this, so that as the camera lifts it also shifts, revolves around some pivot which is not our original focus. Also, often the camera will temporarily settle on a larger feature in a shot, related to context.

For instance, there's a shot here that starts with a face, then lifts and revolves around a group, centering in action, then moving around the city and finding a relevant billboard, then moving on. I think there are scores of these here and they very craftily underpin the basic architecture of the thing, where the transmovie context shifts.

You can see this in a few scene transitions as well, which are also engineered to fit the architecture of shifting contextbeings.

I'll give one example. In the future as the web matures, I expect we'll have all sorts of film- related lists with clips. Best kiss and stuff like that. Here's my suggestion for one of the most cinematically appropriate transitions ever.

Steel Leg has previously put his handwritten card in a can and kicked it nearly to outer space. At the time, we wonder because the card was intended for the hapless Golden Leg. Now Steel Leg is surrounded by a gang who wants to beat him up because of his inane attempt at shaolin lounge singing. Meanwhile, Golden Leg is at his lowest, drunkenly peeing on a wall. An adjacent wall has a sign: "no peeing on the wall," which takes Golden over. He discovers a crushed can embedded in the wall and pulls it out. From the can he removes the "card" and recognizes it. At this moment the wall crumbles because of the damage by the can.

It reveals Steel, surrounded by the toughs as we last left him, so that now we as the audience will watch as Golden does. We see the fight using a soccer ball, from whence the idea for kung fu soccer comes. (The threatening gang joins the team.)

This device is an extremely clever solution to several problems: how to make the editing serve that architecture of the thing; how to fold our designated audience (Golden Leg) with us; how to logically introduce the notion of soccer; how to show that movie-to-movie "walls" are coming down.

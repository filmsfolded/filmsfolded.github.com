Sometime, you'll have to decide whether film merely reflects or defines the world of romance. I tend heavily toward the latter.

Either way, you really must see this film and "King Kong," the original of the year before. Both were amazingly popular and may have cemented certain notions we have of one of the eight or so ways we know to love. Whether we are incapable of subtle thinking about this deepest of bonds is a puzzle, but we sure seem to demand clarity in how we categorize things that by their nature are slippery.

This is about more than sex of course and centers on romance, but it may the form of romance most associated with deep physical intimacy and possession.

Jungle love. Sure, the way black natives are portrayed as people is obnoxious, but at the same time, there's a yearning for the raw sensuality that is also in these movies as a disembodied force. Since then we've identified this force at times with the black body in a sort of worship. It cuts both ways as any suburban white boy in hiphop gansterglamor will evidence.

That nude swim in the jungle is as much about the jungle heart as the souls that carry the baggage.

A woman utterly committed to sense, even when the alternatives are enticing. A man-beast with none of the civilized skills but a moral purity and devotion to his woman. Many, many episodes where the woman is in peril simply because of the risks of the environment she stirs by her sex -- and saved by her partner.

This, my friends is a fantasy that is impossible to escape, a persistent meme that may stay with us until the medium evolves into something different than what it is now.

Since this is the natural advance visual expression of the film fantasy before the Code limited it, it has come to be the purest expression. Cinematic sex, pure in three notable instances.

-- You have the much noted nude swim which is among one of the most perfect uses of nudity in a story, from his command/suggestion to swim, to his destroying her citified clothes, and the amazingly erotic dance that occurs underwater -- he following her. A terrific choice to use Weissmuller's swimming skills and to find a body double with equal grace.

-- You have the costume. The top is absolutely unremarkable, even by non-Hollywood standards. But the bottom is simply two small rags in front and behind tied by a string. There is nothing under that, we are constantly reminded. In fact at the end, her pubis are clearly displayed. The difference between these two, the demure top and accessible bottom, says more by itself that nearly anything in costumed film.

-- The final cliffhanger. Instead of one beast this time, our love is threatened by natives, the bad white guys (almost an oxymoron: they're there to steal these magical ivory phalluses), and what seems like scores of angry cats. She thinks her lover is dead. She conjures him up in one of the most pornographic images ever, by rubbing a stick in a vaginal rut until is catches fire. (This is when her front flap is revealing her own magic.) Voila! He arrives with herds of erect elephants and the day is saved.

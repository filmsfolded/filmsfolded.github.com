I saw this with "Star Spangled Rhythm" which features Betty Hutton. I was bowled over by her screen energy, but not even that prepared me for this.

Jean just completely dominates this rather tepid story with her crackling crisp dialog. What she delivers she does outside of the story which is supposed to have her watching a film romance between "her" man and someone else's woman. A good writer would have invented something other than the simple sassyness we have here, especially since we already have a bird as an observer. But this was before Sturges.

But no matter, its just great to watch controlled exuberance. I think Clara Bow had it. Marilyn only pretended and I suppose that was good enough at the time. Are there only a few?

Screen energy is so rare, I suppose because after about 38 or 40, Hollywood movies started to take on an energy outside of the characters. Actors had to fit in unless if it was truly cinematic, and that automatically introduces constraints on the energy. So we get a different kind of honesty and appeal, either a smile (like the pampered Julia) or raw risk (like Emily Watson in "Breaking the Waves").

Although the Vietnam environment is pretty stagy, it does reflect on some rather heavy colonial attitudes that were then current, (though the exploiters in this case would be French).

I have no idea what the title means. Perhaps it was clear in the original play. Which also probably did more with the character played by Crisp.

Spoilers herein.

In the late seventies, actress/writer Breillat made a film ("Young Girl") about the nearly  suicidal angst of female sexual discovery/fantasy. It is worth watching for the raw  honesty, but it misses being a whole film. Five years later, she wrote a Fellini film, not a  good one. It was during the period where he felt his only true film was "Nights of  Cabiria." And five years after that, she produced this synthesis of "Cabiria" and  "Young Girl."

It is still not a complete film. Breillat's of the distinctly French school who thinks all the  creative work of a film is in thinking it up, in finding that wrinkle in human emotions in  which to ramble. 

I recommend that you stick to the originals rather than spending time with this  unsuccessful experiment.

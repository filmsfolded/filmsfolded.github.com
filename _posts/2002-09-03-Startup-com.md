Spoilers herein.

I have developed rather solid ideas about what a 'fiction' film should be. It should transform or inform. Is there any reason to relax those standards for 'non-fiction?' After all, we are the same viewers. Our minds and lives are the same. The medium is the same.

Why then do we put up with second rate stuff? Why tolerate junk? I think we relax our standards because we know that it is largely a matter of accident when a camera and event overlap. So you don't get a reality that is created as a whole; you get fragments that are somehow to be woven. In almost every case, the documentary requires the addition of a guide, a narrator that does this weaving for us, who provides all the missing pieces that escape the accident of the camera. In fact, the narrator is the center of the reality and the images annotate with 'true' reality.

Now consider this. It is about a guy who is all drive with no insight; all representation and no substance; all motive and no motion. He is a character without a story. Add to this the gay technical partner who made (we know from other research) some very bad technical decisions and who just couldn't commit the outrageous time because he was haunted with creating a 'family.' Now, there are any number of opportunities in this rough situation to explore, to edify, to transport us to unknown worlds. 

But alas, the filmmakers decided that a 'reality' TeeVee treatment was good enough. That it was enough to just 'be there' and see some candid situations with no insight, no depth, no context. And to judge from the reception of this empty voyeurism, that's all the public needs.

This film is about thin character-based representation. It IS thin character-based representation. It is about supposing that the thinness is good enough for consumers (who here are treated like so much coal to be shoveled). And it itself makes that same assumption. I imagine the executive at MTV behind this looking and acting just like the smarmy Kaleil.

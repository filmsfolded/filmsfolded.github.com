Spoilers herein.

As an enthusiast of film, I've develop all sorts of rationalizations for attentiveness which I  describe to myself as projects. That way, I can report to you on various sub-hobbies --  like the one concerned with style and camera choreography. That's why I sought out this  film at any rate: there's a cinematic sub-art associated with the imposition of style on a  ballet of gunfights. John Woo is a major figure in this little corner of cinema.

My own preference is for less overt choreography, more choreographed camera

movements, more style in the image and less strutting in the character. That's why I  prefer Kar-wai Wong. But there were parts of "face/off" and "MI2" whose excess along  these lines thrilled me, despite the strutting men.

So now we come to what many believe is the earliest successful attempt at Wooist style.  Looking at the first films of a master is often pretty rewarding. After all, nearly every film  of this type is a bad film, painful in places. So watching one a little less good is no  sacrifice: we watch these for moments. And in earlier films those moments are often  fresher, more exciting.

And that's the case here. There are some really horrid sequences, like the tussle resulting  in the father's death. And there's the junky story -- oh and bad acting, even by Hong  Kong standards. But there are a couple sequences that are very successful: both  involving Yun-fat Chow of course: toward the beginning he takes revenge: and later he  steals a computer tape. These are raw, but distinctive. Notice what the camera chooses  to see: small lives in each death, small expressions of individuality and character as each  person appears on the screen for only a few seconds before they are killed. It is as if Woo  creates a kanji character (named Mark!) who spends a second or two creating quick kanji  of subcharacters: making them live by taking their lives.

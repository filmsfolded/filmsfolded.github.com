Spoilers herein.

I love this kind of stuff, when the manner of the film reflects the content of the film, especially when the filmmakers don't know it.

Stiller has subsequently directed 'Cable Guy,' which meanly brought us a film about a guy who meanly brings us film; and 'Zoolander' which is a collection of vacuous postured performances about guess what? vacuous postured performances.

Here, we have an aimless, amateurish but honest film about..

That's right. 

The self-reference is rich. It helps that Winona and Ethan are so darned earnest and so ungrounded in the environment of the film (because Stiller is a poor director). That makes it ever more real to see them disconnected from their film world.

Naturally, Winona is a genius FILM student. (Ethan's terrific later Hamlet would use the same self-referential device.) Naturally, the man in her life who has trouble understanding is Stiller, both in the film and as director. Naturally, all the philosophy Ethan's character is reading deals with just this problem. Naturally, the issue here is that people steeped in irony don't know what it means.

Naturally, this is just the thing Janeane builds her skits upon, so (naturally) she steals the show.

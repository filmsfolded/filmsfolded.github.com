Spoilers herein.

We are all villagers through whose small world great artists pass.

This is so clean, so effortless -- the originality is hard to appreciate because so much has been absorbed into the vernacular, but it still amazes.

My idea of genius is when someone can show you something you have never seen, but show it to you in such a way that you believe you knew it all along.

This is a work of genius.

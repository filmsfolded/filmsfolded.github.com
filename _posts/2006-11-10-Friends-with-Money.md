This has its advantages. The filmmaker and at least one of her actresses are completely in tune. And there are some clever scenes, but not particularly good cinema nor dialog. But I'll go anywhere for some time with Keener. 

There's the illusion that this is a women's perspective, and indeed it focuses on women, well developed women characters. Each woman is focused not on herself, her role as a human in the world, or any of the richer facets of womanhood. Instead each is focused on her relationship to men. 

The tone is light and is billed as a comedy. But underlying the thing is a third generation angry femnism. Okay, that can be useful.

With that in mind, I can say that this is particularly good storytelling if you are used to the "women explaining things to each other over a table" mode of narrative. It depends heavily on this uncinematic device where things are "explained" to us instead of shown. Take that away and you have no movie at all. Its a TeeVee thing.

But if you accept that, you are still stuck with the fact that what we get is not what we know is, or what we see, or even what the characters know to be true about themselves. What we get is what they can find the means to explain. There are all sorts of opportunities for the filmmaker to play the dissonances: what we can build a story about rarely fits what we know to be true.

But alas, this talented filmmaker and her actress collaborators take the easy way.

Spoilers herein.

Comedy films like this are cheap. Sometimes they accidentally hit, so a few experiments are worthwhile for the backers. The most common formula is a comedy about the 'battle' between the sexes, and the most common 'spice' a little violence.

This is one of the failures, but you can see that it lacks only a few elements between where it is and a moneymaker Like say a typical Julia Roberts movie. I think even something as minor as a faster more detached pace and better score could have put this over the edge. All it really needs is a little irony in the camera.

Redheads again. There is something in the playbook about redheads and ambiguity that some actresses have tapped: Kate, Cate, Julianne, Nichole. But not Penelope, alas. ' Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3  You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

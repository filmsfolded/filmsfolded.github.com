Spoilers herein.

Once the pattern gets established with these films, certain things must stay constant while only a few others vary.

What must stay constant is the creature of course, some elaborate story to support the magic, a scheming Oriental (not Egyptian exactly), usually a local dupe, an investigator usually archeological, and of course the 'girl.' Usually, frequent silhouette shots.

In addition to skill in filmmaking and effects, it is what varies that is interesting. Tone, location, reference to others films. Here, we are again in the US. But here we have a really interesting portrayal of the rabble that are draining the swamp. Check it out. It has immigrants and blacks and New Orleans voodoo, in a snapshot of how we thought we were.

The princess here is the prettiest of the mummy's girls in the several films.

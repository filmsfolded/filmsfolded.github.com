Spoilers herein.

Ostensibly a story about one body switched for another, this is also concerned with Reed switching places with Welles. Orson had already changed the world forever by introducing a new language of imagination. Some rushed to catch up. Here is a case in point. Where Welles introduced extreme narrative folding, Greene worked with a watered down notion: human (usually romantic) foibles against the metaphor of national trauma and in its context. Where Welles contrived architectural placements of the camera, Reed gives us a rather unsophisticated tilt. Where Welles gave us systemic decomposition, this project keeps all the decomposing in the set.

But what a set! And of course the final homage is to cast Welles himself as the manipulator of the story. Its a simple grind overall, but built around an obsessive ennui of Anna. Doesn't work for me because there's no way for us to enter the world that she inhabits: we are just given some thin solipsisms on self-directed fate and left to our own devices. May have worked on a war-ravaged audience full of freshly manufactured media notions, but not now in an age of irony.

Even in its era, this is no substitute for the real thing: Reed is no Welles, Alida no Ingrid, Krasker no Toland and Greene never was able to get his formula right for film.

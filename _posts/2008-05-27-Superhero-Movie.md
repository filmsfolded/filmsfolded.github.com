I remember "Kentucky Fried Movie" and then the Zucker projects that followed. The humor was low-brow. The strategy was to cram tons of jokes in because people don't remember the ones that don't work. These, all the way up to say, "Charlie's Angels 2" great fun for movie enthusiasts. It basically meant that you got double the entertainment value from those dozens of bad movies that you -- for some reason, had watched.

But now the technique is as tired and predicable as your usual standup comic. In this case, the target isn't a whole genre but a single movie. It may still work for kids, for whom any excuse for a fart joke is good enough. But it takes all the engagement out of the thing.

See, when you have to be alert... when you have to continuously search your cinematic memory for the allusion... two things happen. One is that you invest in what you are watching. It is what I call a sophisticated folding technique. But it also brings the cinematic experience into the foreground of your consciousness. 

This fails.

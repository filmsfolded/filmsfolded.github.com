Some films you simply watch, and some you allow to settle in the marrow. The real work is in knowing how and which to allow.

I do not allow Fassbinder. I know this is heresy. His energy, and the energy he gave his collaborators is legendary. He is highly visual, in the sense of blocking. He did not understand the nuance of the long form visually so every scene is its own drug hit. Only the commitment lasts the whole project.

This is his most popular film, and the one most associated with the cultural phenomenon he was part of: film contributed in a significant way to the reinvention of Germany (West Germany) into a dynamic synthesis of American cultural values (especially film), German commitment transformed into commerce, and honest, even obsessive introspection. He gave this vision. I believe this happens all the time, but in this case, it was easy to see.

I am annoyed that Herzog is associated with Fassbinder, just because they were countrymen and contemporaries. Herzog looked for the violent charm of place, and captured it violently. He went away from the German soul frequently. Fassbinder captured his energy only, and he simply was not an interesting man.

Students of film will be interested in this, and especially how Fassbinder changed after this when he lost his talented cinematographer.

I have a list of "must watch" movies, and one of the rules is no more than two from any given year.

Here's an odd thing. I have yet to find two from 2005 I would put on this list. But I already have two from 1932 and want to put this one on it. One of those is "Freaks," surely one of the most effective movies of all time, not just because of its cinematic power, but the obvious reality that the characters are playing much themselves.

The other "must see" is currently "Mask of Fu Manchu," something so visually novel it stirs deep. So I cannot put this on my list of what I call "4's," but let me state here that you really must see this.

Yes, for me it is better than the early Draculas and Frankensteins. They have power, but through repetition, refinement that surrounds the experience. But essentially they are literary horror. This is the first major, talking horror film (other than "Freaks") that is purely envisioned cinematically.

It has a sappy ending. And a few of the sets seem unnaturally flat. But its something that weaves the skin.

That's because instead of wangling with science and God like Frankenstein, or virgin's blood and what is effectively gypsy magic -- it is directly American in striking at race and sex.

The race component is typically American in its presentation. This is black man's magic, but it is performed by a white man, Lugosi in fine form. More than any other monster actor, Lugosi's later projects deepened his presence in the earlier ones. He really is a marvelously spooky guy and I have Ed Wood to thank for the creepiest Lugosi.

Its black man's magic, but if you look, all the zombies are white men. The key posse is directly white. Of the many slaves, some are white and others seem like they are whites in blackface, all cast because they have tortured blankness. The very idea of this is offputting.

The story is simple: a man on a voyage falls in love, but the target of his affection is already engaged to a feckless fellow. He entices the couple to his Haitian home to be wed. Meanwhile, he arranges from the Lugosi character to turn her into a zombie for his sexual pleasure, a love slave.

We know from the very first scene that Lugosi lusts after the same china doll virgin. Our original man gets his prize, a sex slave. But she is soulless, emptyeyed. And he decides sex with her isn't what he imagined, so he goes back to Lugosi to ask that her soul be returned. He would rather have passion as hate than passionless love.

That's when Lugosi decides to take the girl for himself. It ends in a silly scuffle.

But along the way, there's a cool effect. How Lugosi turns his victims into zombies is by making an image, a detailed carving of the target in candlewax, presumably beeswax.

Its a clever idea, one I call folding. We are watching an image on screen, and he wants to turn a real character (who is in turn not real, merely played) into an image of herself. Once the waxen image is perfected, it is melted, destroyed. Then he can control what's left with his stare and interlocked hands.

So that we can get the full meaning of the sexual intent, we are shown this doll in the underwear preparing for her wedding with magical sounds out her window. Then she is taken before her virginity is.

The scene where her captor decides her languor is intolerable is something. She is playing the piano. It is music written for the movie, but clearly in emulation of Chopin. That composer is known for music that a strong soul can fill with immense passion. Here it really is passionless. Compare this to the usually opposite effect: Johnny Depp playing Chopin with a corpse, Liv Ullman an other wise soulless woman playing, and similarly the empty Jack Nicholson. "Corpse Bride," "Autumn Sonata" and "Five Easy Pieces." Ah, the horrible power of talkies.

I can tell you that this scared the poo out of me when I saw it as a kid. The ideas were way more frightening than the effects by themselves. Looking at it today, those effects seem ridiculously cheesy but the ideas even more terrifying than ever.

The superficial horror of course is of being buried alive, compounded by the possibility that it would be knowingly done by kin.

But the deeper horror is that such a thing as a curse has power, that doom is inevitable. If you don't know the story, its of a man who has fallen in love with a woman under what are unmentioned circumstances, but they must have been unusual. He comes to visit her in her ancestral home, to find the land, house and family cursed in some unknown but inevitable way. At some point, I expect a good movie to made from this story or some derivative, because it is so highly cinematic. 

Its not just because the idea has such holding power. Its the way Poe amplified it. He did so literally by having his agent of doom a human with extraordinary senses. Every sound, the sounds in particular, are amplified to such an extent that they form their own haunting. This uses a technique I often mention in my comments. Its a class of techniques that shape the narrative in such a way that the reader or viewer makes an unexpected investment. 

In this case, the whole effectiveness of this sort of horror project is getting the viewer to be more sensitive than usual. It works, I think and overcomes many shortcomings of the thing.

The focus is on sound. Now that makes a lot of sense if you are writing and intend to be read. Its a way of superimposing the sensitive fold on the words themselves, giving them extra power. Poe is a master of writing as if it were spoken.

It works, but less well in a film, and is further encumbered by the fact that Corman was -- lets face it -- a cinematic nitwit. But its still there because the source is so strong. Its a sort of doom.

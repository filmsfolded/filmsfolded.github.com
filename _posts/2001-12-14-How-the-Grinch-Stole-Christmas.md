Spoilers herein.

Seuss's charm came from minimalism, a unique sort of theatricality that could be filled in by the reader/listener according to the sophistication of their own imagination.

It was a minimalism in the story. Only one simple thread around which you could impute your own world. Trampled on here with all sorts of extra stuff as if our own minds didn't world.

It was minimalism in the verse. Some scant remnant of that remains, buried deep in ordinary, vapid dialog.

But most of all it was minimalism in the drawings. Those drawings were an anti art nouveau which started clean but ended excessively ornamented. Each line was a joke on itself, a self-referential comment on how the mind likes to take the simplest thing and can't help from elaborating until human limits are reached.

His homeopathic style depends on this phenomenon and his simultaneous joke about it. It would require a rather clever and skilled art director to get behind that and realize it for film. What we end up here is 'Hook,' except the strutter here is Carrey instead of Williams.

The team that did 'Casper' might have been able to pull this off. I don't understand why when they spend gobs of money, they don't spend part of it on a designer with vision.

A romantic movie should have two narrative paths in my world. When you watch it, you have to invest in the romance being a success. You have to buy into the threat to it -- there always is one -- and then rejoice when true love is set in a way that you know matters.

At the same time, the film has to do something quite different, on a different level. It has to add to the aggregate template that you have of what romance is. It can do this is in a mundane way, as most do. Or it can be in some clever way that might enlighten the relationship you have with your life an fantasy in each other. 

This does neither. I think you will have to be young for it to work for you on either of these levels. Or perhaps you have to be the sort of person who believes that athletic achievement is somehow an indication that you have "beaten" life. 

Here's the story: a man and woman meet and have sex. He is from a profoundly broken home. She is from one that is broken in a profoundly relevant way, relevant to the story. They are both from low class backgrounds. He has a history of violence. She begins the film as a trollop, scheming to get a high income husband. 

Some things happen and we end the film supposing to believe that these two will marry and live together happily, even though once during the events he has left her. Why? Because he has endured a grueling physical test. That's all.

He is in a track to be a naval officer. Now, that is about a 2 or 3 out of ten statuswise to start, and probably less at the time of the story. It involves having something like a college education and learning to actually fly. You are supposed to also have some qualities peculiar to the military and called "leadership." All we see is that he passed the physical filter and instantly he is an officer and a gentleman, and more; instantly he and his girl (who has passed no test whatever) have a romance worth valuing.

And more than that even, that it is worth valuing in the special way that film romance is worth entering our lives.

You'd have to be pretty desperate to do that.

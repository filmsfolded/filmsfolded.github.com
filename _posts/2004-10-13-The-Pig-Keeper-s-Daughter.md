Spoilers herein.

On the face of it, this should be one of the most successful of the 70's pseudo-porn movies. The idea in the 70s was to make real films, with a story and all the other things that go with film. Just the sex would be more explicit, some would say simply more realistic.

The problem was one which plagued ordinary film: bad ideas and bad acting. In this case, it should have been a cinch. The actors were simply to act as trailer trash. They _are_ trailer trash, so this should have been easy, as it was for John Water's early films. And the main content was the pleasures of sex. What could be more natural and universally experienced? (Many really successful starlets have only to play this one card.)

But both the acting and the sex are inexplicably wooden, and I just cannot explain why. 'Island of Death' for instance had a similar setup (rural promiscuity) as its core, and the amateur girl there was really very charming. 

Its because sex, at least the sex we think about, isn't from real life any more. It's about films. And to pull it off in a movie, you cannot draw on life but on crafts specific to film. Its why porn died as recorded in 'Boogie Nights.'

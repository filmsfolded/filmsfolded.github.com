Spoilers herein.

I have no idea how many vampire movies there are. Must be hundreds, with very few that are distinctive in important ways.

This one may interest you. It's design is lush, among the breed of ultrabright color versions. Both the baron and most especially the girl are redheads. (The three 'wives' are a brunette, blond and redhead). This is a special trick. More, our girl has lush lips and is French. This era (1960) was a minivictorian one in film where sex was heavily repressed and had to depend on these indicators which is why the redness, Frenchness and lips are so exaggerated.

I collect film references to redheads (suggestions welcome), and this is a particularly rich one. I don't know any other Yvonne Monlar vehicles, but she is just perfect in this. My notion of vampire films is that every element -- every single element -- has to be a highly refined abstract architype. The girl-at-risk has always been a problem, partly because film has many lovely women. The obligatory uniform of nightgown isn't enough to distinguish the architype. So having a red damsel makes it work. Of all the color vampire films I have bumped against, this one works the best for me. The Oedipal overlay is just Hamletean icing.

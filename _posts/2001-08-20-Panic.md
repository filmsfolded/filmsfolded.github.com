Spoilers herein.

'Things you can tell by just looking at her' for men meets 'You can count on me' meets 'Affliction' meets 'Grosse Pointe blank' and is better than any of the last three.

Its all in the writing, and thank God that the writers get a chance sometimes.

Good writing is a conversation between the writer and the 'reader.' A good writer gives the reader room to breath and supplies the oxygen. Its got to flow as if you knew it all along, so you can cocreate the images with the writer -- so that you suggest things to him that he picks up on. Some deadtree writers understand this -- very few screenwriters do. And of those that do, it appears that they need to take matters into their own hands.

This makes two great screenwriter/directors to appear this year, Garcia and Bromell. 

In one case the pathos of loneliness, in the other the pathos of not being alone. One feminine, one masculine. Both mastering the quiet sin of covering ourselves with someone's troubled soul, knowing their pain but only (only!) feeling an echo of our own.

Some small self-reference with the framing as a bed-time story and an internal framing as the all-important squirrel kill. But otherwise it is an emotional meditation, straightahead honesty. The cast knows this and even Ullman plays it straight. Must have taken some real convincing in her case, and I'm sure she was cast because she has a reputation for playing multiple characters.

Macy already has enough classy work to see he knows and apparently can advertise his strengths. Check out Jurassic Park III where he talks always ahead of the beat. Not as fast as Jennifer Jason Leigh in Hudsucker, but the same notion of making fun of acting. Then turn to State and Main where he actually directs bad actors but varying his delivery! Then to Mystery Men where he plays three roles: himself looking at you and winking; the family man who needs a role; and that role (the shoveller), each with a different speech pattern. So he knows how to stand in two sets of shoes, the writer's and the actor's.

Here he stands in two without acknowledgement: your shoes as cowriter, and Alex's. No one else has to work very hard. Sutherland overdoes it, but that's the point of the character. Campbell has no center, and that's right too. Doesn't matter whether she's good enough to do so if needed. Its the breakdancing of acting.

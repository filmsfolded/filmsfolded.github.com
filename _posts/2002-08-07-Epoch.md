Spoilers herein.

This film has bad acting, poor production values and stinking dialog. No matter. Science fiction is held to a different standard than all else, because often the idea behind the project is strong enough to carry the day. Witness 'Forbidden Planet.'

Superficially, the idea behind this is the most ordinary in the genre: humans discover an alien artifact that exhibits mystical powers. Often, those powers imply the creation of ourselves. But this effort seems to add nothing new to the standards: '2001/2010' and 'Mission to Mars.' But a clever viewer may see something interesting here.

IMDB doesn't say, but the writer is probably Terri Neish, who also appears here as the lovely Bhutan mother. It doesn't take much to see an original ambiguity that the studio deadheads erased: that the appearance of the object, indeed its creation, was caused by the child. She must have conceived him immaculately, something mirrored at the end.  (Virgin birth is a tradition that apparently first appeared in this part of the world and was spliced -- as it was with other messiah accounts -- onto the Jesus story some time after the early gospels.)

His powers manifest the object and control its behavior. All of a sudden one can see some interesting structure. The author of the story is the author of the child who is the author of the object who is the author of the viewers. Now that's promising. It probably explains why they sought Ryan O'Neal. He plays a somewhat similar role in Kubrick's exploration of this idea in 'Barry Lyndon.'

Some quibbles:

-- NSA doesn't do what they show here. They just listen and worry about code. She must be thinking of the NSC plus Special Ops assets.

-- The shape of the object is somewhat clever. Would be better if the rock were slowly moving like a tornado. That was probably intended because it spins toward the end. Troubling shortcut: the shape of the object is precisely the same no matter what the perspective.

--The code to unlock the object is too childish. If the radial arrangement of the planets around the sun were important, so would be their distance from the sun, tilting from the ecliptic plane and possibly a few other characteristics. But even then why? The scifi template implies it is a test of how far we have evolved. But observation is not understanding.

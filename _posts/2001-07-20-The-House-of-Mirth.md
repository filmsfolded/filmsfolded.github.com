Spoilers herein.

This moved so slowly, with so little to hold attention that I compared it while watching to: 'Mansfield Park,' 'Portrait of a Lady, ' and 'Up at the Villa,'

In short, the good is a very strong source story which hasn't been trampled too much. And it has two strong actresses: Laura Linney and Jodhi May. The bad is the wildly uneven cinematography and the blunt skills of Aykroyd and Anderson. Some viewers commenting here actually like them. But to me, they are in clearly over their head. Compare what Frances O'Conner did with less good opportunity in Park. Dazzling. Even Liv Tyler in 'Onegin,' no giant talent, owned her character with more depth than what we see here: TeeVee acting, not the slightest nuance.

On the other hand, take as a lesson how artlessly the period was used, even understood, in 'Villa.' We have much the same feel as here, despite more show of costume. There and here is a dearth of the eye. One example: the extraordinarily expensive and technically impressive boom shot at the opera, gives no emotional impression at all. Waste. The closeness of the boxes and the peering from one to another could have been strong. Completely missed.

Go watch 'Wings of a Dove' instead.

I'm rooting for Luc Besson. We have a dearth of competent, modern French filmmakers. And Jeunet is pretty uneven. Besson isn't all empty style, even though some projects are, like the last one. And he had a distracting obsession with a pretty girl.

Now, he's back home in familiar territory: the battle between good and evil where each is personified (and innocence takes the form of a young girl). You might get distracted by the drama in which the poles of these two extremes are stretched.

Hoskins plays a highly abstract and theatrical evil man in an evil context. Freeman's normal lazy avuncular treacle is for once just right as an equally absurd "good" man who tunes the dogboy. But all that's just context for what Besson's crew does with jet Li, who pretends to be more than twenty years younger than he is.

Some viewers may appreciate the drama Besson draws between the way these two poles influence Danny. But the actual drama is actually never shown, merely inferred. No matter for me, because what I came for was the way Besson's notion of camera movement changes the perspective on Li's fights.

I suppose the fights themselves are rather ordinary as these things go. But the way the camera engages is rather extraordinary. This is where all the investment in an angry, energetic style pays off. It is not art yet, like Lee's "Tiger," where the camera shows the fighters but gets swept up in their masters.

The one blot is how clumsily he handles the primary metaphor. He wants us to think of Danny as a shackled dog. But he confuses leash and collar, and the condition of being constrained. Inexplicably, the most constrained is when he is least constrained. I think few in the audience will even notice this dissonance because we accept the merest sketch of such metaphors and fill them out ourselves as if they made sense.

The same with the music, There really are piano pieces that would have made sense in the story. But it is enough for nearly everyone that something pretty appear to fill that space.

Though Freeman's hackneyed routine is proper here, there are still plenty of uncreative visions. Do we really need yet another movie where the bad guy's henchman falls on the bad guy's car?

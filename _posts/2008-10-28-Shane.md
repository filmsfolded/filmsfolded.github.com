Regular readers of my evaluations know that I am generally tough on old westerns, unless they are pure.

Its not because they were bad or ineffective when they were made, but because the ground has shifted under them so that many now deserve to be disowned. These westerns, combined with war movies, did more than reflect American attitudes, they defined them -- defined what it meant to be a part of this experiment of a collective social contract. So, just as many are repulsed by overt racism in old movies, so am I at many of the Wayne-Ford school which spawned a destructive political movement. 

The worst of these celebrate violence as a manly attribute and adherence to a code of honor above all. But there are what I consider "pure" westerns where the sense of place conveys an honesty. Many of those old Gene Autry movies, though trite were pure in this sense. It's not a dogmatic, cosmic honor so much as a sense of friendship and justice. Its not a sense that somehow God will even things by making the good guy prevail by being more effective at violence. 

This little film is pure. And it is wonderfully cinematic. 

Its pure in the story, where the evil rancher makes a pretty compelling case. He isn't intrinsically evil. He thinks he is being wronged. It is a case of competing rights, which is the true (and heartening) American story. Our hero isn't haunted, merely reluctant. The story comes so very close to implying a romance between him and the wife of his friend, that it shines in deliberately avoiding that tired trick.

Its a bit cloying to have our designated on screen representative be an unrealistically dog- like boy (deliberately reflected in a loyal puppy elsewhere in the story).

But its worthy in another respect as well -- its editing. Usually the method is to provide two of the following: grand Technicolor vistas, dynamic movements of animal groups, silhouettes, dust, distant solitude. What Stevens attempts is something more documentary- like, avoiding all that. Its striking because of what it is not. The place is damp, real. The light is dark, as it actually is. The fights aren't noble or comic.

His technique was to shoot every scene countless times and them burrow into an editing room endlessly making combinations, each one affecting some other, remote part of the film. He was obsessive over the consistency of tone, so even in films where he fails, you can setting into the world he creates. He drove the actors nuts, but it really is worth it. This is clean, consistent and pure. It is worth watching.

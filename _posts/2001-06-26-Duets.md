Spoilers herein.

I love films that are about themselves. Here is a father who is in show business, with a daughter who is entering show business. They have been apart, and now come together emotionally and professionally. And what do they do? Make a film with the same story.

The story is about performers by performers, It straddles the point between when they are 'on' and when they have their regular lives. No surprise that the 'on' times are good and the 'off' times less so. What I like about this film is the unintended effect that it is pretty poorly crafted when dealing with all the 'off' scenes. But that's just so perfectly self-referential.

I am not a fan of Gwyneth's. (I was surprised to learn in my research that there is actually a 'hate Gwyneth' crowd, hung on some foolish semiotics.) But I thought she did well in 'Emma,' where she added an underlying performance to the sanctifed words of Austen. Here her part is so poorly defined, underwritten, and dare I say so poorly directed by Dad, that it gives her room to add her own depth. That also is wondrously self-referential.

Spoilers herein.

I think of Woo like I think of Oliver Stone, not a particularly intelligent man, but one that from time to time shows a worthwhile cinematic vision. Parts of 'Mission Impossible 2' were very nice. Parts of 'Face Off' were visually exciting, even with the two clumsy actors involved. One of those is back again, annoying as ever. But I just ignore the actors and story. After all, dePalma made one of the best camera-centric movies of all time with Cage in 'Snake Eyes.'

But I searched in vain for anything to like. You already know the story is vapid and the acting childish. But where is the vision? All the attention seems to have gone into coordinating the fireballs and body parts. Ridley Scott can do this with real visual effect. Malick can even do it with poetry. But this is a TeeVee quality eye.

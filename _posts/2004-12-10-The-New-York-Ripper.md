Spoilers herein.

This is a story along the lines of 'Lolita.' In that book, the whole trick was that the narrator (Humbert Humbert: he has the name repeated because he is on both sides of the fiction) is mad. Everything he says is untrustworthy but somewhat believable. Its so much so in fact that most readers never question him even though toward the end he clearly is having paranoid visions.

There are a number of films that use this device as an excuse for trashy or exaggerated production values. For instance 'Robot Monster' is perhaps the junkiest scifi move I've ever seen. But it is the 'dream' of a ten year old, so is aptly junky.

The trick in this one is that we are seeing through the eyes of a madwoman, someone who thinks she may be the killer. She is mad of course, but it is her physicist boyfriend turned mad because of an injustice to his little girl. He takes the persona of rubber duck from her hospital room in a clever narrative fold.

The violence is very cheap and theatrical. Not scary or real, but scary because it is obviously demented. In other words, it is scary enough that _anyone_ would imagine these things, even more that it is a filmmaker-as-insane girl.

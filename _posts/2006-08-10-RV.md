Robin Williams has three skills and he seems intent on rotating his projects so that he can use them all.

One of them is his improvisation, which is along the lines of Jonathon Winters but without the apparent mental illness. When he does this, he's special.

The second skill is related, the ability to seem severely damaged. He can be effective in this, depending on the project. He's not a national treasure in this regard.

The third skill is to provide the normal array of comic faces when performing the comedy of embarrassment. In movies, this is already a hundred years old. Its simple: put a man in situations where we are supposed to look at his face and laugh at his appearance.

I know this is hard to do. Though he is far, far from the best we have, he should get some sort of celebration for what skill he has. But let's face it: you have to be pretty extreme to have any sort of effect these days. Or you have to have tools Robin doesn't, frailties that because of his other jobs we don't allow him.

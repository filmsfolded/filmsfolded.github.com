Spoilers herein.

This is what you get when a horror film homage is made by someone who doesn't really  know what movies are all about. It doesn't find a hook like 'Carnival of Souls," ' Coven,'  Clerks' and ' Beetlejuice' do.

It is exuberant and clumsy, except for possibly two things. One of them is the game you  can play by locating where all the pieces came from. Zombie has no originality at all,  which I guess is the point. I got a cheap thrill when I recognized some esoteric details in  Doctor Satan as coming from Overdog of 'Spacehunter.'

The other fun thing - if you are inclined - is playing in two sequences that each are  'films within the film.' The first is Doctor Spaulding's funhouse, which had the potential  of being ever so clever. And it still can be if you imagine that everything that  subsequently happens is because they are STILL IN THE FUNHOUSE.

Then again, at the appointed time the Firefly household breaks into a show. This is also a  cool idea for precisely the same reason and you can also imagine that everything that  happens subsequent to that is because the guests become part of that show. This would  be three levels deep. Check out 'CQ' or 'Twin Peaks' to see how this can be done. 

During that show, the future Ms Zombie wears a red wig. Gotta have a redhead.

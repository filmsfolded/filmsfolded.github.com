Spoilers herein.

For decades, filmmakers have fallen into three camps:

--those that believe film is a simple entertainment medium focused primarily on storytelling

--those who function as artists in what they consider the newest and possibly most powerful art

--those that recognize the other two, but see film as as a means for conveying a message, beit journalism, essay or propaganda

Kirk Douglas was clearly in the third camp. A solid American, this is his personal commitment to liberal American values, seasoned by his zionism. The context was a dangerously paranoid government apparatus that was slipping very close to fascism. 

Douglas was a major player at the time, and he is behind what we see here: good and evil; slavery and freedom; the power of a righteous stand. Not only is it explicit in the story, and his performance, but in the way the film was made and the collaborators selected.  What makes this a mess is that there is a fundamental mismatch with watching through Kubrick's eye. He was brought in after production started and disowned the film on completion. He is clearly in the 'art' camp, possibly America's best example. Incidentally, in recent years Douglas has shifted his membership retroactively to the 'mere storyteller' role in a speech to the National Press Club and his book.

Sort of takes the honor out the principled stand, doesn't it?

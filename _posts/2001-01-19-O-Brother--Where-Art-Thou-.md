How blessed we are with the current blizzard of fine films!

Spoilers herein.

Here the Coens embark on their most ambitious effort yet, playing with multiple dualities:

--the real world and a  magical reality of myth

--the world of performance and the world of politics

--the stories of song and those of image

--the lovely bright yellow land of the south and the unlovely people who partly covered it

In the center of each duality, they placed the pretense of our trio moving through what Goethe said of Ulysses was an apprentice voyage. Clooney will really be p***ed when he realizes how these guys goofed on him. Turturro is a long time Coenite who understands their light regard for the patina of entertainment the ordinary viewer expects. In fact, he has just come off of two rather ambitious projects concerned with just these four dualities and the complex role of the actor in weaving them into apparent entertainment: his remarkable 'Illuminata,' which he funded, wrote and directed, and Tim Robbins' similar (but more political) project, 'Cradle Will Rock.' Turturro is becoming a phenomenon, real intelligence.

Tim Blake Nelson participated in the highly adventurous 'Hamlet' of last year, tilted toward just such an issue -- with Hamlet as a film student musing about these dualities. He then took Julia Stiles, the Ophelia, and directed the forthcoming 'O,' a version of Othello that is held up I understand because it is 'too intelligent.' He has written and directed other films which I haven't seen, but 'Eye of God,' written and directed by him is supposed to also be about this same stuff. Natch, all the bright filmmakers are buzzing about these issues. Together, Turturro and Nelson play the game of switching realities, while both Clooney's character and Clooney are oblivious. The title is from a Sturges film-within-a-film. Same issues -- everything revolves around the chicken dance.

A small complaint: the symbol of blindness was too heavihanded, much as with Woody Allen in 'Crimes.' And 'soggy bottom?" Joyce.

Sometimes you can see the genre engineering. It is better if you do not, but many of these are mass produced chum, and what we have is the Spielberg-supported "high concept." Take the woman who wrote a couple of women's movies with simple appeal and make an Oceans' 11 but for women. That's the pitch. 

Have lots of squeals of joy, toilet and sex humor (but of the supposed women variety). Well, you can read about these failures from others. The thing that interested my here were the men in the story. When you make, say an Oceans' 11, it is all about the men. They need to be cool, ultracool, some of them. There are mechanics of plot that are essential, but it is all about that feel of natural cool.

When you make a woman's film, it also about the men. Look here at these men. You have basically four men, the three partners of the women, plus the head of security at the Fed. In this writer's mind, these are the four cardinal points of male partnership. We shouldn't put too much credit on this, because the movie was a huge flop. But it did pass Hollywood's engineers, and was re-engineered late in the game to suit what some committee thought would work, man-wise.

You have the inspector: cocky, intrusive, too proud to admit his own inadequacies. (Remember that this was released at the end of the W Bush era.)

The primary husband just wants a job because he feels inadequate. He is "smart" in a women's magazine sense, meaning he knows lots of facts.

The secondary husband is a dullard, probably a school dropout who performs manual labor at a meat plant. His wife is the pretty/sexy one in the bunch, and we are supposed to get the picture that his meat is worth it. 

The third "husband" is the one that fascinates. A huge audience for these movies is black women, and this social engineering seems more mature. We have the Latifah character who is just fine on her own without a man. She manages her sons well enough -- we are told multiple times how well they are turning out. The guy in question is introduced as a lout, a dog who hassles women sexually. Watch the careful way that he is transformed and how he becomes both her sexual partner (about which much is made) and one of her sons.

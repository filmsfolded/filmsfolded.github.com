This is an interesting film. The story is sophomoric and the characters are, well, cartoons. But the cinematic world is interesting. The creator was clearly brimming with ideas, and these are obviously from his print efforts.

This was done using print techniques. meaning that the animation is drawn and page-sequenced rather than using what are now common computerized techniques. So this may be the best of the films that are 'hard-edged.'

The art itself is all cartoon, meaning each object and person has sharp outlines. This is hardly unique, even with modern (but cheap) animation. But at least here, you have some clever shading and use of complementary colors. Few colors are used throughout. Shadows and blends are also "hard" of course.

More interesting is the hardness elsewhere. Because this is cell art, there is no motion blurring. Its lack is jarring once you've gotten used to films which use it, so because of its age, this film has already achieved a curious antique effect of hard motion. Obviously, the animator was aware of this, because he uses extreme discontinuities between shots. The result isn't just simple choppiness, as others have noted, but a continuation of the punkish style of hard edges, as well as an evocation of comic panels.

Stupid story, but curiously stylish, dated animation.

Spoilers herein.

I made a mistake that I would wish you to avoid, dear Reader. Knowing all the books, I started with the video of 'Gaudy Night,' because that book is the most intelligent of Sayers'. It deals with a self-referential nature of what is written and what is real with an amazingly rich confabulation of her ideas and Harriet's, struggling with the attraction of Wimsey. Wimsey lives in part as a traditional detective, avatar of the reader in a struggle with the writer for control over the logic of the story. But he also is a creation of the writer's, a child and lover of sorts. That book intelligently wandered through that curious, ambiguous territory. But the video did not, a great disappointment.

This one, both an earlier book and video, does much much better. Bunter is still largely passive, and the Mums are strangely absent. But there is some preservation of the parallelisms of writer and written and of love that appears and love that is created. Harriet Walter is just right for Vane: a nervous curiosity, a willingness to take great risks but questioning all the way. Here attractiveness to Wimsey is based on the fact that she is an adventuresome writer in a world that is obviously at least partly written.

There is the preservation of the discussion of writing this very book, while she is in 'prison.' The adapter also preserves the self-reference by introducing a calendar countdown in the form of a billboard for an upcoming drama. Very clever. The visit to "bohemia" is necessarily toned down (a sad loss) but in its place is an interesting shorthand: the business with the nude model (uncredited on IMDB), Imogene, who is a civil servant.

All in all, see this one first. The book is less ambitious, and the adaptation better preserves much of its intelligence.

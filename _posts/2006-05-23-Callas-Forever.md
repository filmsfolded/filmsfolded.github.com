What a strange film. I recommend it not because it is a successful project, it isn't. But once having seen it, and putting it aside for reflection, you will appreciate the experience.

Here is the real world: Maria Callas was an extraordinary voice and unusually committed to the acting component of opera. In life, she was famous for being imperious and vain. She was unattractive, relatively illiterate, achingly dumb and mercurial. 

She had a long affair with a similarly oafish but wealthy shipper with whom she shared class and cultural values. When he criticized her sexual grace, she lost weight which brought about the end of her career. She lived the end of her life sullen and rejected.

While in her prime, she was directed by Franco Zeffirelli who gathered much acclaim for those and other operatic productions. At the end of her singing career, she appeared in a non-singing role in a film of another Italian filmmaker, someone who shared Zeffirelli's cinematic notions. He courted her for his own projects and consumed some of her (not his) money.

Now some 25 years later he makes this film about a fictional situation in which he makes a film, itself a fiction because it matches her young voice to her older body.

The movie itself is pretty tame, a highly stylized portrait of a lovely woman with grace and integrity. Completely unreal in tone. It looks very like a stage production. Within this film is the inner film of an opera that is well done. Opera is a strange art whose existence is justified by multiple arts overcoming the constraints of one another in the combination. No film or recording can be opera, so we have that problem, one where touch is required. The opera we see isn't opera, but cinema.

So you'll find the movie itself tepid.

But the idea of the thing is dizzying. It is a film about a film. It is a constructed fictional life about a woman who lived a constructed life that incidentally evolved from her profession, which was constructing characters on stage. It explores (in no deep way) matters of truth in art, while itself being an exercise in bending a truth which was fabricated anyway. 

It focuses on imposing the old onto the new in terms of Callas' voice. At the end, the Callas character nobly decides that such a thing should never be done and the fictional film be killed, but then this film is precisely what she argues about and by that time you have already watched it.

The way I watch films involves a lot of invention. Usually it is in cahoots with the filmmaker, elaborating where he or she would have me.

Sometimes it is freed from the images, when they are inadequate or point to external context. But with some Welles projects things are about as perfect as it gets because you know what he would do and didn't, or did and it was undone. By that measure, this is perhaps the greatest Welles film. Its like his radio dramas on which it is based: he gives you something and you fill in the rest with your imagination.

But here, the filling in has to do with all the time-shifting the man would have us do. If the main engine for narrative slicing in "Kane" was how a character makes his own story, here it is how a character discovers his. For you to understand my meaning you have to know the story. Spoilers here:

One man hires another to discover his past because he cannot recall. Toward the end in all the versions we have, it becomes clear that there never was any memory loss. The rich fellow merely wanted his detective to find out who could reveal his past so that they could be killed. I am certain the Welles intended this to be more ambiguous, and for the man in question -- played by Welles -- to be unsure what was recalled, invented by himself, invented by the (untrusted) narrator, invented by the witnesses, true.

That's why he planned flashbacks within flashbacks, flashbacks that overlapped and contradicted, that went backwards and sometimes forward (remembering forward). Its why he had multiple narrators overlapping the same events. The anchor in this was the character of his daughter played by his them wife. At this time they were passionately involved and indeed she became pregnant during filming. She was the one that mattered, our designated watcher. So the filmmaker-lover dynamic takes a particularly dense narrative braid here, with sex offscreen mattering as much as all the other things we don't see in the story.

Along the way, the shots are more adventuresome than in Kane and many of them as radical as "Evil." Imagine the edit as convoluted and dense as "F for Fake."!

I am pretty sure that the sequence at the end was intended to be toward the middle. 

This is an amazing film experience if you can watch it and construct the possibilities in your own eye, like the detective character.

I would list it on my best list, but I only allow myself 2 from any filmmaker, and his 2 slots are taken. But you really should see this, probably in the "comprehensive" version. Its the structure determined by others but with more bits.

Spoilers herein.

Here is a textbook case of the different forces that shape books, films and TeeVee shows.

This was a wonderful book because of the way observation was managed and the language was rooted in place. There were lots and lots of literary tricks pulled, most of which enrich the experience. It still is worth reading. It expands the mind.

From that, Hollywood extracted a film. All of the literary devices are lost as a matter of necessity. In their place are a few strong performances and some artsy salon photography of the kids. The focus of the film is now not in its texture, but in the story itself. Instead of the racial injustice being a device to move the narrative, we have it at the only focus.

Well, that was good enough in its day because of the role film plays in shaping the national consciousness. This film went a very long way toward defining a national morality concerning at least Southern-style racism. But the context has changed, and Peck's style of acting in particular is now unpopular -- and somewhat annnoying -- in films of substance. It is now a simple morality play, with some skill but little art, not entirely unlike 'Gentleman's Agreement.'

Now along comes this TeeVee show which is the third abstraction in the series (real life, the book, the film, now this). The point of this is pretty diffuse, with lots of elements that don't make sense together. For instance, we have a wholly incongruous and inapt title and epigram, several remembrances of place (with films of the location, interviews of old-timers and voiceovers from the book), interviews with all the key participants in the film, some footage of the civil rights struggle with rambling observations by an articulate black lawyer, and a few other talking heads on various elements of the book or film. 

The whole thing is hopelessly unfocused and it is a scandal that it is carried in the same basket as the book or even the film. The film, if overly blunt, was at least coherently focused. But you see, with TeeVee stuff it doesn't matter, a rude and disturbing fact that places the viewers of this mush in precisely the space as the trailer trash originally targeted. That's because the viewers are not prompted to think at all, we are told what the message is. What the lesson is. What the moral is. What every normal person would think.

Naturally, racism is bad. But look at what this TeeVee thing does. The real problem is how societies become whole and live by mechanisms that seem to demand stereotypes, something the book takes headon. Stereotyping is the problem, which in the South settled on race, or rather racially-defined class. Now look what this show does: it substitutes one evil stereotype for another. The blacks are noble, the (roughly) equally impoverished white trash are given all the traits originally assigned to the blacks -- they are dirty, inarticulate, liars, sexual deviants, violent, chummily conspiratorial.

So while giving us the standard sixth grade civics lesson, it reinforces the basic problem of parading stereotypes and reinforcing the mechanism of stereotyping. That's the evil of TeeVee: the medium demands it. A worse example is the 'Paradise Lost' TeeVee 'documentary.' It similarly discusses a purported legal injustice that it says happened because of the stereotyping of the stupid white folks involved. It similarly exploits its own stereotypes by pounding home the stereotype of the people they accuse of stereotyping. It similarly takes its title from a classical text with no connection whatsoever, but which gives the illusion of an Olympian vision and moral neutrality.

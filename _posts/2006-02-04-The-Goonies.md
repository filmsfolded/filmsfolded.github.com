For the only time ever, you'll have here three of the most obnoxious pop filmmakers alive: Donner Spielberg and Columbus. I cannot recommend this to you as something to actually watch, but it is a terrific example in emotional manipulation.

Start with the notion that you want to be as effective and manipulative as possible, which means you want to be cinematic. Then go to the notion of the most cinematic of notions, noir. It has emerged from film, is unique to film, and it works.

The characteristics of noir are simple. It is a world apart from the world of the viewer, but it has representatives of the viewer in it. The world is characterized by a capricious fate that toys with humans. Randomness and traps. Odd coincidences that simply seemed arranged for the benefit of the viewer. In mature versions there is a hint that the presence of the viewer is the reason that fate is arranged so cruelly.

Now imagine these three kings of pop brainstorming on a successful kiddie noir. It would have incompetent parents, and tons and tons of boobytraps. This would have to be faced by the kids with only each other to rely on. Each kid would see himself in some one of the carefully chosen characters.

And there will be folds. The young kids will be folded into the older dysfunctional family. And the movie we watch will be folded into a pirate movie. In fact a specific Errol Flynn pirate movie.

Hey, it works, in the sense that it sells tickets. If you want a lesson in pop manipulation, play with this.

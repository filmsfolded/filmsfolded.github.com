Spoilers herein

The curse continues. The Snavelys steal orange groves and become immensely rich. Coon  Dog Conner steals into the family. Bob (not Stanley) Parsons is next, then the babysitter and  on after that. All is suicidal, following a family karma.

Gram runs away and begins a more creative theft: together with Brian Wilson and Bob Dylan,  he reinvents the way our minds work by tracing new musical paths next to old ones. He is in  me and you, probably a good thing.

In a bizarre chapter, a drunken roadie steals Gram's body and attempts to burn it. Too much  gasoline flares out the fire and the result is a mess. Thirty years later the same roadie is still  stealing, and the result is a similar mess. Not good to have this tripe in your mind. No.

Spoilers herein.

Usually when I comment on a film, it is in the context of ideas. I root myself in the notion  that ideas can have power, including emotional effect. Further, I suppose that many of  these ideas come from thinking filmmakers.

That sets me apart from others that look for dramatic engagement and credit actors with  great influence.

But my reaction to this film is different than both. In this case, I am reminded that some  things in life take on their own identity and do what is necessary to promulgate. Things  like musical tunes can be thought of as living, selfish entities that adapt so that they  stick in your mind and induce you to hum or play them so that they can similarly stick in  someone else's mind.

Ideas like equality and justice and god are in this class which is generally called 'memes.'

Powerful films are full of memes, many of which aren't known at the time. Some of these  we notice after the fact. Here, we have a few phases in the language of eyes. This was a  new language in 1920, just when movies were inheriting the soul of our culture, that  place where we collectively develop our imaginations. And Clara Bow was the first great  artist of sculpting emotions with her eyes.

And once those eye-phrases are captured, they do what they need to to survive and  promulgate. Their expression in this film is secure, as it is now on DVD and thoroughly  distributed throughout the planet. Not even a dinosaur-sized asteroid could kill that  now. But the more effective promulgation is that now some of Clara's phrases have  entered the music of everyday sexual dialog.

See this as one of the better vehicles for various opportunities she has to play her eyes,  probably better than most of the others easily available. Otherwise the film is a waste,  except for recalling a time when it made movie sense to portray a man of culture as a  French scientist. That's a meme that is dead.

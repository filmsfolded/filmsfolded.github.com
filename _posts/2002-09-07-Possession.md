Spoilers herein.

I eagerly awaited this because of LaBute's 'Nurse Betty.' That film had all sorts of complex abstractions: the woman, convinced she was a character, trying out for the role by pretending she is pretending. Very clever. Very sophisticated in terms of narrative underpinning. And we had the book, which ties the two periods together with poetry as the target of a mystery. So I was expecting some wonderful merger of narrative poetry, folded time and unraveling truth through discovery. I had in my mind, the template of the similarly targeted 'French Lieutenant's Woman' which had the same structure but with acting (!) in the place of writing. This would be better because the language was so lush in the book.

And in 'Duets' I thought I saw Ms. Paltrow actually achieve that multidimensional acting where one plays a character and simultaneously comments on it.

Alas, this is rather a hash. Pulling off this sort of thing requires a rough parity between the two worlds, lest one be merely a frame to the other. And that's what happens here: the modern world is uninteresting. The mystery is supposed to balance the poetry, but the mystery is lame -- on the level of the clunking 'Kate and Leopold.' That the mystery wasn't so conceived is denoted by the inclusion of the iconic Anne Massey. The casting doesn't help the modern story: Gwyneth as a scholar? Gwyneth as sleuth?

Obviously, the studio cut a lot out of the modern story: the part about the lawyer and Indian girlfriend goes nowhere. The setup of the bespectacled secretary having a crush is lost. The business about the competing scholar/collector was too weak to have been conceived that way.

The other requirement is to form a link between the two worlds. 'Dead Again,' 'French,' even the otherwise forgettable 'Misadventures of Margaret' do this well. It seems not difficult. But look at the transitions here: clumsy. They ask a lot of forgiveness from the viewer. They should sweep ahead of our imagination, not think along.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

In 67-68 there was a day I will always recall. In the morning, I encountered a professor to whom I had submitted a paper. He started off by telling me that it was psychotic. He then explained that he meant that as a compliment. People are either psychotic or neurotic, he explained and the only worthwhile things come from the psychotic, even though the best come from the other.

That if you were neurotic, life wouldn't be worth living, so one might as well kill himself, as he then contemplated. But only a psychotic would do so.

That same evening I had an argument about then popular music, much like some of these depicted here. One fellow was enchanted by the perfection of the Byrds' 'Tambourine Man.' Another was blown away by the ambition of The Doors' 'Light My Fire.' The latter was a failure, but a spectacular attempt at godhood. And yes, Hendricks versus Eric, John/George, Janis/everyone else, Miles/Ellington and so on.

The next day, there were riots. More intelligently motivated than those in Paris, but silly and deadly all the same. 

I've since developed a more folded cosmology, but I still often run into these dichotomies and am convinced that the only people who consider them important are those trapped on the dead side, the neurotic.

That's what we have here, a neurotic obsessed with psychosis. The levels are: a filmmaker imagines himself as a young man imagining he is an old man making a movie about his youth in which he imagines the world in the form of twins. Each level reams the next, pulling from the films he feels reflect the sort of artistic psychosis he yearns for. Each potential breach is virginal.

And the other way around, films as dreams too. The best part of this is when the poet returns and finds the three nude, expensively drunk, entwined. They are careful not to wake the dreams and tiptoe out, leaving a 'poem' to keep them going.

It is no surprise that he was able to do this with interest when he was able to rely on that master, Brando. And no surprise that he fails here.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

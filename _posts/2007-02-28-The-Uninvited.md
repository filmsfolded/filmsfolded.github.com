Poor production values by today's standards, and a minor twist at the end.

But there's hardly any haunted house story that isn't of interest because there's this game about watching.

Nearly all modern movies recognize that there are watchers (us) and those watched, the actors and characters, sometimes the actors watching the characters. Haunted house movies add a new dimension, literally. Ghosts watch humans and vice versa. 

The story here has a brother and sister who buy the haunted house and in due course each find true love.

The interesting thing is the double twist: one ghost watches another.

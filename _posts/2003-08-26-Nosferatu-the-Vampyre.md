Spoilers herein.

Herzog is a hero of sorts. His Peruvian river films are life-altering. His meditation on  glass was a remarkable commitment that we can share. Here is a man whose own

openness and commitment often translates to a voyage into visual intoxication for us.

But his openness is a vulnerability as well. Strong forces can intervene, can enter the  dialog and capture the cinematic blood of the enterprise. Almost always, we are able to  prevent that evil from penetrating the second barrier: from the film to us. Herzog is more  open than we are, and that's the appeal.

Here is a case. Herzog was approached (just like Jonathan Harker) for a commercial  endeavor with more money than he was used to. He thought it would be a simple  transaction: he could work with the mood, could leverage the genre. Vast vistas,  hundreds of small animals as out of control neurons in a mad mind. Female beauty as  hypnotic magnetism. Obsession rooted in vision.

Kinski.

But this project coopts Herzog in just the same way we watch Harker. What happened  was precisely what happened to Tarkovsky six years earlier on "Solaris." Like a million  flies, small compromises for the public, mismatches of tone, demands of the genre,  faithfulness to the word, inadequacies of German history, weakness of the impact (to us)  of the plague all conspire to capture the soul of the film.

Is this the only color Dracula with no redhead?

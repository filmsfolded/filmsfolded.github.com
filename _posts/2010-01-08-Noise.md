Somewhere in the rulebook it is alleged to say that in a mystery film things have to make sense. 

In another rulebook, near the top, is the imperative that films should matter. Fortunately I know which library this filmmaker visits, but YOU will not until you get to the end.

Storywise, there are a number of murders and murder attempts. In parallel, we get introduced to a policeman, incidentally assigned to the area that matters so far as the murders. We see him get involved

Meanwhile, overlain on the procedural-mystery, we have a rather adventuresome experiment in untrusted narration. Senses and sense is occluded. It is experimental because it isn't carried the normal way alone. We do have the flashback from the witness as a lie, a visual device. We have other small liars as well, in the story itself. But the notion is carried by sound; what we and key characters hear and do not. Along the way we get some expertly sculpted sound design.

It is pretty trilling.

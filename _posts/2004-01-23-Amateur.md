Hartley is one of the most interesting directors working. Many associate him with French intuitives, but I think his experiments are more intellectual, more New York. His films are not only about other films, but exist in a world abstracted from them where almost everyone else insists on wallowing in the same space they reference.

This is still an early work, which I had the opportunity to see with its purported referent: 'Band of Outsiders.'

Writing as a fulcrum; performance as porn; film humor as a selfaware deadpan. Sex as an abstract creation. Pain as an act. 

Huppert as walking hair, early Posey on her way to Jackie K.

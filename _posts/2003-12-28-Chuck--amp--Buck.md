Spoilers herein.

I believe that as many as a third of all films are 'folded' in a straightforward way, meaning that they are explicitly about themselves. Often, these films have a film or play or book embedded within that mirrors the 'outer' movie.

In all cases, the distance of abstraction between the outer film and (here) the play is precisely the same as the distance between real life and that outer film. The outer film's story is about an obsession with an idealized character. We see how ridiculous and unhealthy it is when displayed in the inner play (and the accompanying photo montages).

But we aren't pushed into the obvious conclusion: this is a standard voyeuristic look at two guys in a way that is not fundamentally different and similarly unhealthy. At least we are not pushed by the film itself, but anyone watching will come away damaged by the suspicion that we have been separated from the healthy, into Buck-like obsession by how we approach so-called 'character studies.'

This idea by itself makes up for the fact that film itself has no energy.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 3 Â– has some interesting elements.

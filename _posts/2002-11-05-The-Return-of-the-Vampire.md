Spoilers herein.

Just as a story, this is the best of the vampire films in my estimation. The more that followed, the more self-quoting they become so only the early ones can be really interesting.

This is absolutely uninteresting as a film, I only comment as a story, and it is only the story and few images and postures that propagate so. Less, this film has less sex than necessary for the cinematically effective.

What makes this the best Vampire story? The book was written as a journal of a scientific mind, but one that may be becoming increasingly untrustworthy, like the much later 'Lolita.' It is essential to preserve that distance. Film must commit to the reality of the vampire, at least conventional films must. But here, they preserve the notion of text, and the notion of a distance from the 'writer.' Tesla is the vampirehunter of old, tainted as a vampire himself. Destroyed, reborn, and now rehaunting the original readers and their friends and offspring.

At the end, the skeptical inspector looks directly at us and asks if we believe. 

Throughout, the specter of 'Germans' provides a context. The inference is obvious, or would have been to British audiences at the time.

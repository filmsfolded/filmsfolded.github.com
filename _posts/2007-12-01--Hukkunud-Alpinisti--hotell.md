When I was a kid, we had a TeeVee show called "The Outer Limits." It featured science fiction mysteries, done with mostly bad acting, competent writing and extremely cheap effects. It was an hour long, which really means 45 minutes. The speed at which the story was told was great, because these mystery scifi things draw from two constricting formulas, and unless you are particularly inventive, the shape of them is pretty set. Cram that into 45 minutes and it moves briskly and tickles. Stretch it out with ponderous inner thinking and even 8 minutes seems way too long. 

I came to this because it was represented as clever and also as the best Estonia has. But everything about it excepting the makeup of the women is amateurish to the extreme. If it were on that 60's TeeVee show for kids, it would be considered a bad show.

I understand the book is much better in the way it fools you into thinking this is a normal mystery formula with a random collection of people cut off (avalanche) and with a detective as our designated on-screen viewer. The red herring here is not to confuse among suspects but among genres. Its supposedly successful in the book, But not here. No.

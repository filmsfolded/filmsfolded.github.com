I am reduced to observations that are ordinary, banal because so. 

Our Cate reduced to a stern manikin. This is the Cate who is our actress most capable of nuance and depth.

Our Elizabeth reduced to a bipolar simpleton. This is the queen who invented modern drama, metaphoric use of the English language, and current notions of religious freedom. Very likely the three are related in some way.

The rise to responsibility which we all know to some degree, is here just simple acceptance of fate.

A great naval battle turned into rockem sockem robots with Errol Flynn flying about. Its as if Raleigh actually distinguished himself there instead of by the enslavement of the Irish. 

The appearance of the magician Manteo and his removal to the lab of Dr Harriott, the magical "school of night" of Raleigh and Southhampton, and Shakespeare. The murder of Marlowe. All hidden. 

Raleigh is depicted here as a buccaneer ruffian. But far from being coarse, he was an effete courtier, particularly skilled at the game. And one of the foremost poets of his day. It was his witty repartee that attracted the attention of the queen.

A pale love story, cobbled up in every way. 

An active, encircling camera and use of space. Things I normally admire. But this is all so formulaic, overdone and irrelevant. There's space, but we don't get it.

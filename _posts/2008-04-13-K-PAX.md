This came close to working for me. Partly that's because our designated internal watcher -- Jeff Bridges -- is so darn effective&gt; He's said he doesn't like these roles, that he would rather be in the story than watching it. But with "Lebowski" and "Fearless" he's become just about Hollywood's best.

The setup is one that balances two genres, which means that it balances two universal urges, both with religious expressions avoided here.

One is the great story of miraculous, supernatural grace.

The other is the larger and more common (in film) of redemption. 

Both are ordinary, and the narrative novelty here is the ability to play them off against each other. The tension is that they are to some extent contradictory, and it is that tension that has sustained at least Catholic and Fundmentalis Christianity.

On the one hand, the only path to redemption is hard work, pain, suffering. On the other, it is a rapturous instant, granted merely by believing -- in most versions it doesn't matter why you believe, only that you do.

Is a tension that simmered during that dark ages and forms one of the great templates of Western narrative. Here recast in a direct framework. The possibilities are wonderful. The actor Spacey does understand this horizontal folding. (See him in "Hurlyburly.")

And he does well enough to keep us from bolting. But the project is mismanaged. I think the reason why is simple: the studios want hope and in this case hope is on the side of random, ultimate salvation, miracles, lotterywinning. So the ambiguity is screwed, the tension dissipates and the wonder of the watcher is changed from something that matters, to something that simply assures.

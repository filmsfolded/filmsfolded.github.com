I have a fondness for good artists that have skilled energy, grand scope and fearless ambitions. If they give us that, who really cares if a project doesn't meet its infinite horizon? Is it less powerful when it fails? Does it matter that the subject is about precisely this?

About the subject, a gay boy grows up with talent and contrives to make a lush production with extremes of sexual matters and societal thinnesses. Slade and Haynes.

Sure, I thought the flying saucer business extreme stylistic gaudiness, but isn't that the point? I found all the narrative threads broken, the first manager, the fan/groupie/reporter, the wife. Sure it was a Citizen Kane with big gaps. Sure it was an experiment in several, parallel narrative devices not entirely integrated. Wasn't that the point?

Contrast it to Oliver Stone's film of the Doors. Polished, emotionally safe. Does that make sense?

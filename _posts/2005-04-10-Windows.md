If the world of intelligent film were populated only by Greenaway, it would be enough for me. Many of his projects have a depth that surprises on frequent reviewing, and some of his earliest and most conceptual are the most captivating.

This is the earliest I have been able to see. Already, we have notions of taxonomy, flight and architecture made cinematic by suggestion. If I had to reduce his talent to one notion, it would be that power of suggestion -- the ability to take a collection of surveyors tools (usually in terms of layers, manifolds, counting and accounting, and dissecting) and tease a semantics out of images by overlaying those tools on the images.

No one else does this. No one at all. It is no surprise because of the difficulties. Even Greenaway fails often (M, Dante and Belly come to mind).

This is not the first early film of his you should see. Go immediately to "A Walk through H" if you haven't yet experienced it. It transcends.

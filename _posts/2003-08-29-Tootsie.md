Spoilers herein.

The standard for actors these days is folded acting. That's where an actor acts the part of  an actor and communicates both to the audience. I have a database of hundreds of such  projects.

There are two jokes this time around. The first joke is that the character is an obsessive  method actor and is played by the most obsessive method actor of the time. This is  pretty sweet, turning his usually obnoxious excesses into humorous prancing. To  accentuate the joke, he is surrounded by actors who can communicate without showing  us that they are trying. Bill Murray is so natural and Jessica Lange so real, they bracket  the self-reference.

To further guide us in this layering, the director himself has a major role, and in fact  most of the funniest reactions. His role outside the film is roughly analogous to that  within the film.

The second joke is the old Shakespearean bit: lovers disguised to each other. I thought  this humor was substantially less clever. The thread seems to exist only to distract from  the more clever joke. Part of that distraction is Geena Davis in underthings, one of a  couple stage jokes.

I like to recommend movies in pairs. Watch this. Think about the self-reference bit. Then  wonder what it would be like if Jessica's character's character (Nurse Charles) got  confused about the levels too. Wouldn't that be the obvious next step in the self- referential humor, and from precisely the other direction? Then see 'Nurse Betty' and  watch Rene play Jessica playing Charles play Betty and pretending not to.

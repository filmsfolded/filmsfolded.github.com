Spoilers herein.

Yes, it set a new standard for violence in mainstream fluff, and stunts also. And who can  forget the shock at the time of both a nude gold girl and an aggressive girl named Pussy  Galore. It also raised the bar for interesting lethal sidekicks. So it is of historical interest. 

But by today's standards, everything that was then fresh with is now stale. If you must  see a Bond edition, pick the last one.

Ted's evaluation:1 of 3: you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

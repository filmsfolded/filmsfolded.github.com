The story in this concerns someone who owns everything but a small bit and the fellow, the "small guy" who owns that bit. There are three adults, all extreme caricatures. Like some cartoons, but few from this era, the thing is self-referential in illustrating the struggle. So it is mildly interesting on that score.

It is "banned" because of its pretty offensive racist stereotypes. 

So if you watch this today, you could be in several different minds at once. You could see it the way it was intended, an amusement with jokes about cartooning. You could see the abstraction involved. The bad guy is a smarmy white stereotype with distinct prejudices. (I will not mention them.). The "girl" is a performing object. The "little guy" is a fat, boastful black.

You could see it as yet another drop in the ocean of oppression of an entire people. But then the unintended brilliance of the story comes into play: abstraction, exaggerated storytelling, money, class.

Whether something is worth watching has to do with the state you watch it in.

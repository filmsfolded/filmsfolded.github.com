I saw this together with the execrable 2004 "Nicholas Nickleby." I hated the fact that something large had been reduced to pleasant moralistic moralizing. What if the thing started life that way? Well, in my case that makes all the difference. This is a movie following a movie about a book and the last movie's only plot involves the promotion of that movie by one person and the logistics of making it by her partner. It isn't the first time that performance and sports have been folded, but it was clever here.

In "Nickleby" what you had was a grand structure neutered for popular cinema. Here, you have the most trivial of excuses for a story reinforced by cinematic structure. A whole different thing and wholly palatable.

So it isn't offensive by that measure, and the roles of the sweet parents are well targeted by these pros. There are some funny vignettes.

So it all boils down to being a silly amusement with a moral, and whether you will be put off depends on what you think of the moral. Readers outside the US may need special guidance here. A very strong political identity has been built in the US by so-called "social conservatives" who cite religion plus "old values" to promote a sort of family myth.

That myth holds the family as a sort of energy sink that needs constant attention and tradeoff. No mother can have a career without damaging her family, even a career such as here which simply shares her family with the rest of the world in the original book.

And fathers have to constantly balance his commitments. Attention to job is always a matter of selfishness and is at the cost of the family. Big cities are evil, family-unfriendly places and we should all retreat to the red state heartland where this fiction is honored. If you can stand that, you'll like this little movie.

But the matter has been so politicized in the US that you may be disgusted by this instance of pandering to that sector to make a buck.

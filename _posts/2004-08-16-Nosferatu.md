Spoilers herein.

I consider 'Shadow of the Vampire' one of the most intelligent films ever made. Herzog's  remake of this is even interesting if terminally flawed (as Herzog himself gets bitten).

And this has some intensity to it. One can readily imagine it set in its time as a masterpiece  of true horror. But transporting ones vision back eighty years strains all the visceral  pleasures away. Either way, this is pretty lame stuff now. Everyone should watch it - not for  enjoyment but as a foundation for fuller realization of what followed.

The one interesting thing here for me was the historical splinter of true magic: the Bulwer  character. I think he is original to this version. He is based on the famous novelist Bulwer  Lytton (influence of Henry Irving who Stoker managed), who cofounded a 'magickal' society  based on stuff derived from cabala and celtic mysticism. This stuff was pretty potent in  terms of its evil side and is the true incubator of the vampire myths.

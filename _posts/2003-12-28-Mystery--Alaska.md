Spoilers herein

I suppose every celebrated actor has old projects of which they are ashamed. Crowe in 'Gladiator' learned from a master working director what it means to project presence into the forthcoming scene. He is one of the few now who can do it. That ability has since held him in good stead, detracting from his significant limits emotionally.

Here he is simply Mel Gibson lite, quite an insult to himself and us. The movie is merely another sports movie, with all the clichés that brings. This time around we also have two marriages threatened and saved, one budding romance and one father and son reconciled.

All of these, including the son, are redheads. All of them, especially the quirky Lolita Davidovich outact our poor muscular beginner. Sad.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4  you can find something better to do with this part of your life.

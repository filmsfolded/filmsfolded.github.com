Three years ago, Eric Rohmer made a shocking film, 'Anglaise et le duc, L'.' The characters were all 'live' and the backgrounds all painted. Even the textures on the interior sets were painted: the molding on the doors, for instance.

The period of the film was the French revolution, and so was the style of the painting. What was shocking was how the viewer was reregistered. Usually, a film of the past is modern in most respects, and only the costumes and sets are from the time period. Sometimes - but rarely - the dialog as well.

The viewer gets to sit in her unchallenging modern world and peer into some vague evocation of a modernized past. What Rohmer did was place much more of the film part of the film in the past. The viewer sees something like what an 18th century Parisian would produce if they had the technology. The viewer now had to place herself _in_ that world to watch that world.

Now this has bled into a big budget film with the intent of chasing a comicbook vision. But instead of giving us 'X-Men,' a modern view, we get a modern notion of what we think a 1930's view would be of our times. Fritz Lang strikes again, but this time it is painting (and saturated, gauzy sepia).

In the one modern nod, we have the self-referential bit. Not one scene has actually been photographed and our hapless heroine spends the entire film trying to take a picture. 

I suppose good actors would have ruined the effect, so it is just as well that we have this passel or competent celebrities.

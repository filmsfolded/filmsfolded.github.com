Disney has the world's most advanced character lab. 

That's what these kinds of movies depend on. What we see are the broad strokes, but what's more interesting are all the little touches that are added based on the science of discovery through tests.

It all revolves around the notion of the wheels of justice. So the mechanical ticks of the character mesh with the John Hughes-like mechanical contraption she gets caught up in at the end. And that mirrors the mechanical way that all this is derived and the mechanical reaction we unwittingly intend for our children to have when watching.

Wish he would have used Molly Ringwald.

Spoilers herein.

Oh what love does, when yearning crosses boundaries and makes someone see another as better than they really are. Here, it ends in suicide. I'm talking about Mike Figgis' view of girlfriend Saffron.

A reliably trenchant play: a competent footman; a very clever camera; a Nyman-like score that works; and a completely inadequate lead. Figgis doesn't care. I find his camera interesting, but have absolutely no illusions that he is working to reach an intelligent audience. He's working for himself and his drives, both artistic and emotional.

The contrast with Mamet is fascinating. Figgis has a curious eye which Mamet lacks, but Mamet understands the power of drama where Figgis does not. They both drive actors, but Mamet adds the visceral to the cerebral. They both create vehicles for their lovers, but in Mamet's case, he works to accommodate Pidgeon's limits.

Figgis is like PT Anderson in my book, but a whole lot smarter. They both have talent, but they've got some theatrical maturing to do before they become worth serious viewing. That includes being less selfish.

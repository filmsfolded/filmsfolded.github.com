Spoilers herein.

It is part of the human condition to imagine ways in which the universe reflects that small vocabulary of happenings that forms our lives. Greene created something of an industry in writing stories that exploit this notion, stories where some moral dilemma is mirrored in huge political or natural tides. It is a simple, unsophisticated idea, but one that sometimes created spellbinding stories as he moved between levels.

The effect was one of seamless integration, adding apparent new depth at each level. Never was the depth real, however. Never were there any actual new insights on the larger or personal dynamics. But we went along because of the sheer audacity of the idea and the skill by which it was exploited. Now along comes another film of one of his books, and another failure at this seamless integration. In the book, the forces that unfold are as fluid as the imagination can make them, but with film we are limited by what we can see.

So we see war and intrigue. And we see a simple competition of two aliens for the attention of a woman, all with mutual exploitation in mind. Yes, there are a few metaphors (Vietnam as mistress to an aging Europe), but the cosmos of the personal is wholly unrelated to that of the political, except that each happens to be there. This completely drains the project of life and all we are left with is a workmanlike picture with professional but uninspired and unintegrated souls.

One element of that workmanship was notable: the rhythm of Caine's delivery. Like any low class English actor of his generation, he is obsessed with subtle nuances in inflection and how that denotes social standing. Here he employs an amazingly effective trick: his timing is rushed a tiny amount, even when giving the voice-over narration. This is a well-established phenomenon in conversational pecking orders: the dominant speaker always has this aggressive timing. Fraser takes this and delays his timing to an equally subtle extent (but less consistently), making him the 'quieter' of the two.

Spoilers herein.

Yes, Waters was influential in encouraging independent talents like Jarmusch and Hartley  just because of his presence. Yes, there was a time when revolting irony actually had a  place. Yes, self-aware stoned parody seems a necessary sophomoric step for every kid.

But that makes 'Flamingos' of historical interest, not necessary worth watching today. It  is more 'Coven' than 'Eraserhead.' And it is why this documentary is better than all  Waters' films until 'Pecker,' where he learned (and could afford) ironically detached than  ironic irony rather than self-abusive voyeuristic pseudo-irony.

The appearance of the now-retired film censor who encountered 'Flamingos' is a cheap  shot, sort of an afterglow from cheap wine: it works but at what cost?

Irony is a much expanded concept in film because it forgives all. But the very existence  of this documentary is very weird: it expands the notion and breaks it.

The idea behind Waters' sort of shock-trash is that it is off-hand, disposable. To  'document' it reverses that. To go further and celebrate its influence and permanence in  film history sort of defeats the purpose. Its as if you celebrated a jazz solo by talking to  the musician about fingering. Its all the more shocking when you discover that someone  was filming the filmer in 1972. 

Ask: now why do that? And all the value deflates. Why do that? Because the shock value is  what matters, not the destructive irony.

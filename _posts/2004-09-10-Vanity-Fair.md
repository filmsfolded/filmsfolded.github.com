Spoilers herein.

The story here is something of a cross between 'Gone with the Wind' (which in turn was based on the 1935 film of 'Vanity Fair,' the first color movie) and 'Barry Lyndon.' But never mind the story as it is so plodding, so bereft of motive and emotional linkage that it merely gives an excuse for the form. The novel was concerned with people fighting to stay alive, with a dramatic yearning for fulfillment so exaggerated that the reader develops similar yearnings. All that is transformed into mere costume here.

Instead, we get a woman who was born into a rich, painterly vision. She spends her life trying to incorporate that vision into her manner, but it is all borrowed passions. She comes close to real gamblers and feigns risk but hasn't the nerve. She pretends to be freely capricious but all the actions are as automatic as those she condemns.

She has some emotional performance skills. But the real thing that separates her from the higher classes is that they can distinguish intricate, ineffable matters of style. Try as hard as she may, she cannot.

And that's just the filmmaker.

Reese is red here and dressed fetchingly, but is no Miriam Hopkins.

I can find something to like in almost any film. What's great here is the trimaran. Not all the stupid gizmos, but the boat itself. It's great. And Tripplehorn is appealing. But that's not her butt in the nude scene.

Overall, this film stinks, but in truth, it's no worse than dozens of blowemup hits. The thing that killed it is Kostner's attitude. In other stupid fantasies, the hero looks at us and winks 'look at me make a fool out of all of us, but it's just fun.' Arnie, Mel, they all goof on themselves.

But Kostner in real life takes himself so seriously that as an actor he couldn't escape playing it straight. As the mariner, his seriousness here is offputting. Combined with his similar hubris in the industry, this project was doomed.

The real interesting story behind this film is the story of how it got so broken at the studio level. After Sony bought Columbia, expecting miracles, another crew of Japanese bought Universal. We've made a special study of this case. The real problem here was the Japanese top-down management style. These guys just got snookered, plus they made some heavy false economies by going outside the film industry for key elements of the marine sets. That's how the trader colony sank.

After waterworld, this Japanese management left the industry with their tail between their legs, selling to the Canadian booze guy.

Making a documentary is tricky business. Making one that takes sides is even trickier. There is no pre-existing compact for journalistic integrity and big business is almost too easy to matter. These guys find an approach that touches home. They do it in two ways I think, and the skill with which they navigate this is enough to recommend this.

The first is how they found a way to get our attention. Big business is stealing from you and oppressing people. Well yeah. They buy elected officials to make laws that not only benefit themselves but do so with utter disregard for the health of the nation and its people. They are destroying the land and the populace....

These are such open truths that even though everyone other than an interested party would know, it is one of those things you decide to just live with. Perhaps you even rationalize it away with some story. Who knows what, in today's myth economy? But watch, what these guys do is hit each viewer. It is not just the planet, the nation, the economy, the constitution... It is you they personally harm with every meal. And you have no escape. These guys found a way to fold in the viewer.

The second thing they engineered was the finale. Most other documentaries of this type seem to aim at simply making you angry. This one goes further. Think you are powerless? You are not; you control the market. Want to do something? Do this and this and this...

Compare this to "King Corn," which did a better job of actually telling you some scary facts.

It almost seems comically simple. And it is almost a waste of the power of cinematic engagement to limit it to merely this. But see? The idea is to fold the viewer in by narrative engineering, and then once they have you, they change you. Now as it happens, I willingly accept this contract in this case. But I can see that this same device is being used elsewhere for goals every bit as nefarious as the offenses reported here by agribusiness.

Which is the culprit? The availability of power, or its abuse?

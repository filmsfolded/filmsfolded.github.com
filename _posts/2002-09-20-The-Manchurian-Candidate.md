Spoilers herein.

This has one very effective element, and it is strong enough to make it of historical importance. I'm talking about the incorrectly termed 'dream' sequence. It is actually a dream, a real presentation, and the image of the gardening lecture impressed on their minds. At some times, elements of one bleed into the other.

This is the stuff of Lewis Carroll, in fact invented by him, a fact here acknowledged with the incestuous Red Queen as a card. The hero's love is a genie: 'Rose,' also from Alice (and the Shakespeare he quotes).

The film isn't as explicit as the Alice books, but the core notion is here: our behavior is programmed by the logic we adopt, even when it is artificial. And nowhere is it more artificial than in politics.

So we have the traditional folding of a play within a play: this performance about politics as a performance fighting the unwitting performer.

The acting is dreadful. Never mind. That set of scenes is enough.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements

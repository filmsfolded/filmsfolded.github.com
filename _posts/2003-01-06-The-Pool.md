Spoilers herein.

There are two kinds of slasher films. One kind involves an unstoppable supernatural force, the other is basically a country house mystery: one of the characters is the murderer but which one and why?

In the second kind, the kind we have here, we don't walk away satisfied unless a particularly clever solution is provided. That's as it is with all mysteries and their siblings: con films. The solution here is dropped on us without making any sense at all, and we just shake our heads and walk away. But I think the project was not so dumbly conceived.

European audiences would get a whole lot more richness out of the characters than North Americans. In this cast, there are stereotypes from many different cultures. The interplay would be easy to read if you knew the code. Americans don't have that code, so these characters and the minor frictions among seem like random noise.

Prague is one of the two most photogenic cities on the planet. But we only get a couple shots of it. The pool itself is pretty cool, but the architecture and layout are not exploited. I recall another film, 'Session 9' built entirely around a cool set someone discovered. This set, and the water, could have been inexpensively exploited. A lack of skill prevented it.

The two most attractive girls (both redheads) are the first killed, contrary to the basic rules of slasher films.

Each of these films has a signature slaying. In this case, it is the only one with any imagination and is explicitly sexual, involving both an uncontrollable slide down a vaginal tube and a parting of the (presumably entire) female body from the crotch.

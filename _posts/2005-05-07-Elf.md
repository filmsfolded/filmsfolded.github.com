Sometimes a movie's story says a lot about how it came about. Let's imagine the green light board at the production group meeting and deciding they need a cute Xmas movie fast.

Is it any wonder that the central storyline involves a "book" company with Green in the name which needs a product by Xmas. In panic, they call in a little guy. He shows up with a formula. The formula of this project is half "Big" and half "The Family Man" and its ilk. Small wonder that the film ends with our little guy writing the story that we see.

I suppose it is well enough done for what it is. But the problem with this is also embedded in the story. Santa's sleigh used to be powered by good old Xmas cheer just like Xmas movies used to be. 

Now, both the sleigh and its movie container need artificial motors.

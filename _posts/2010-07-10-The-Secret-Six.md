What we have here is an early gangster movie: we follow several lives over a few years, all linked to a crass slaughterhouse worker. He had the same job as Bardem's character in "No Country for Old Men," but uses a sledgehammer. He rises in the ranks, assumes the position of mayor and is taken down after an exclusive run where everyone is paid off.

Made during prohibition, the movie gives some insight into the makeup of the gangs. Prohibition was mainly a racist, anti-immigrant movement, something like the ugliness we see today. The gangs were a social countermovement with distinctly old world character. 

So there are two story elements, folded. But the thing is primitive cinematically, and not of interest. But it has one remarkable cinematic puzzle.

The gang wins for most of the movie. Law enforcement is thwarted at every turn. Eventually "the law" finds its own strategy: bond together as a gang themselves. Thus the "secret six" are formed. Presumably, their identities must be kept secret to prevent being rubbed out. Here we have two strange ideas: that it takes a gang to counter a gang, and that secrecy is key. We actually see them twice, which is when the strange thing occurs.

These guys are in a room with several "non-secret" law enforcement guys. All six wear blindfolds. Now it is obvious why: with cinema still this young, you could get away with this shorthand. It is a device that tells you the nature of the secrecy. It tells you a lot visually. It makes no sense in the real world, none at all. But it is an easily readable cinematic shorthand. We wouldn't allow it today.

Building on this is a background character. Our primary witnesses in this are newspaper reporters as usual for the period. But they are supplemented by a gangster gopher who is dumb. Turns out he isn't.

Swing jazz plays through the whole thing without a break.

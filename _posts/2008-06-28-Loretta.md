I get to see a few student film projects, and some of them show real talent.

As many of my readers know, I am attracted to folded narrative. The setup here is that you have a writer making a script of which you see several versions. These versions are pulled from various genres. This is a difficult thing to do, for a director to do, finding the right niche that both brings the whole history of that reference into play and colors the reference, usually with humor as here.

He's a smart enough filmmaker to have written something that depends on an actress and to have found someone who can carry this device. This Loretta is confident enough to pull it off, pulling us into the whole thing. Its only a few minutes long, so the achievement is remarkable. The last segment is the weakest because the humor can't swallow the reference to violence, but the rest has world class promise.

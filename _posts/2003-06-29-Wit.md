Spoilers herein.

This is a curious project. It disguises itself as a TeeVee death-movie character study.  Instead, it is a highly literate exploration of the power of words. The idea is that words  ARE ideas, that representations are reality, that actors are real (can directly address the  audience), and that all of these provide a platform for selfawareness.

I suppose some folks might actually think the point of all this had to with cancer and the  pathos of a woman's death, or the skill of such a portrayal. But I believe it is crafted to  elicit precisely that notion and then destroy it. The story is not about cancer, but about  WATCHING cancer. The doctors are not healers, but observers. We are not passive  watchers, but observers that are addressed directly. Emma is an actress watching the  whole process, a professor observing herself and only incidentally a woman dying.

Donne invented the notion of life as an observation. Pinter spend a career as self- referential writer exploiting the layers of story and representation of the story. See the  gold standard: "French Lieutenant's Woman." Here he plays the erudite father who gives  the epiphany of words. Here we have Emma who has rewritten the play to emphasize the  dramatic layers, that same Emma who did the same for Austen. Here, we even have  Beatrix Potter, who was used in much the same way (to reference dramatic layers) in  "Myth of Fingerprints."

We even have Chris Lloyd as the archetypical observer, reversing his "Cuckoo" role to  emphasize the layers.

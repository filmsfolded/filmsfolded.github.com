One of our most important movies was Tod Browning's 1935 "Mark of the Vampire." I won't spoil it, but it is at once an amazing vampire movie and a step outside the movie-making process. One of our very first and best narrative foldings.

Two years before, we have this similar project. Not quite as artistic, but still of a higher quality than usual for the period.

The idea is simple, seems simple now. But it its day this was pretty sophisticated stuff. 

It is a movie in the mad doctor genre. And the mad doctor creates a movie inside that, one from the vampire genre. Nested movies, folded narrative in its primitive form, before it evolved into what we have today as the major innovation in cinema.

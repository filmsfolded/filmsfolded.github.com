Spoilers herein.

I am often hard on films that do a poor job of creating a world. That's an especially  obvious flaw in science fiction movies, especially the space travel variant. So I need to  celebrate when one comes along that does do well, even if it is a cheesy project.

And this is cheesy. But nearly all of this ilk is, from Star Wars on down, with the only  question being a matter of what bothers you and whether there is enough to distract you  from the annoyances. 

This one has four features that allow me to recommend it to you:

-- The first and most obvious is the squawking Molly. I have a special fondness for her.  She had just done her first film, in which she carried a key role as the Miranda in a  humanized "Tempest." I distrust the values of Mazursky, so reject that project -- but its  very being involved some considerations of what film is. Molly carried her weight with  some pretty intense players.

Then she did this, then some well done exploitative kiddiefare. Then, my friends, she  turned her back on the trite world of John Hughes -- though it made her a celebrity --  and joined Goddard in a version of "King Lear" that has to be one of the most interesting  film experiments ever. I am currently waiting to see here in "Tulse Luper," by our greatest  living filmmaker.

She is not a great craftswoman, but intelligent actresses are so rare you have to note  when they come around, even if as a bratty 'Liza Doolittle.

-- The original release of this was in 3-D, and really was worth experiencing. The  technology is unsatisfying, even in the hands of Hitchcock, but was great fun.

-- And it was fun, especially given the extraordinary design of this film. Yes, it all looks  hokey, but this is pretty wonderful art nouveau inspired hokum. Its pretty atypical for  space designs which tend to be techno. And it is different than the "Mad Max" ethic  which is punk, boring. This is swoopy, organic and appealing as all getout. Just like  Molly, now that you mention it.

-- Finally, there is a piece of film iconography in its embryonic stage here. Film is largely  a matter of successful images that enter the world and stay forever. One of those images  is Robert Redford washing Meryl Streep's hair by a pond. That sensual image has since  taken on a life as its own meme. You can see here -- so the legend goes -- where  Pollack got the idea. A sweet bit of unlikely film ecology.

Those are enough to allow me to pass over all the inadequacies in this. Except one.  Science fiction writers have the burden of making things different but similar enough for  us to grasp. Here, Niki uses the term "Brainworked." We are supposed to understand it as  a notch down toward the primitive in understanding.

But think about this. Primitives can talk about why something is, or why you believe what  you do. But it is a very specific sophisticated notion to impute a brain that reasons so.  That's a notch beyond where we are in everyday life folks, not below.

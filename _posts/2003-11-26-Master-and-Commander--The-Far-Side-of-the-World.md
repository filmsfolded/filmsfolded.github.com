Spoilers herein.

 Market forces sometimes twist and break things, even when they have promise.

 The promise is here: Weir has the ability to create life from the environment. He did so  masterfully in 'Picnic,' one of the most haunting films of all time. You can see that as  well in 'Fearless'  and 'Mosquito.' Ridley Scott does this well in 'White Squall,' which was  sort of a warmup for 'Master.'

 Crowe has one magical power as an actor: the ability to project himself into the next  scene.

 The books have something of a following, and quite apart from their Harlequin values,  they are accurate so far as many facts about shipboard life and operations. So you can  see the greenlight: battlescenes, shipboard (and some historical) details, and some  attractive characters.

 Unfortunately, these simple values (battles, authenticity, characters) - undoubtedly  micromanaged from the top - don't map well to the peculiar and valuable strengths of  Crowe and Weir. Lacking that chance at meaningful art, this film must be judged purely  on the simple values the studio emphasizes.

 Unfortunately, the characters resemble their bookbourne origins as cartoons, and the  action scenes are ordinary and studiosafe.

 The only possible redeeming value might be in the skill with which they evoke shipboard  life. Unfortunately, I saw this the same day I saw 'The Return of Martin Guerre,' which  may be the gold standard for a story shoehorned into an excellent travelogue of the past.  'Guerre' went into the past and discovered a story. 'Master and Commander' engineers a  modern story and cloaks it in trappings from the past.

 What I saw seemed authentic enough. But it omitted so much else that the world was  never fully defined. We had just facts, and among those, a cello and specimen collection  seemed as large as obscene scrimshaw. I understand why they would have avoided the  long-sanctioned (in the British navy) practice of homosexual 'sea-relief,' the complex,  really esoteric longlived superstitions, and the many-layered class system. They would  have unduly captured the viewer.

 But to omit carving, knotting, singing (except for one lame scene) the 'art of sleep?' To  have no tattoos except on some fingers? To avoid the amazingly inventive swearing? To  have the clothes so clean and the officer's teeth so white?

 There is a tradition of veracity in sea films, beginning with 'Down to the Sea in Ships'  which involved a real whaling crew (and is worth seeing). The books miss the mark by  overly simplifying and romanticizing the environment to host a simple melodrama. This  film does too.

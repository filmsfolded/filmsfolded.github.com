Spoilers herein.

I'm very impressed by how Cukor put this film together. The songs are very good, but the film still rates high even without them.

The tone of the presentation is pretty sophisticated. Any musical is a self-aware stage production in the first place. Shaw's original was centered on the notion of performance, and Cukor merges these two in a few ways:

--The costumes look like stage costumes, the sets like sets. The acting is projected' as if on a stage; motions are grande.

--Some stage setups are particularly self-referential: for instance the morning after the play in the first scene is set up by actors entering in layers and freezing until the action is 'turned on.' The Ascot crowd choreography. The 'get me to the church' piece reminds us of the camera by cutting back and forth between different stagings of the number -- novel for the time. 

--The story is set in the context of performance. The play begins by players leaving a performance; the father becomes a celebrated philosopher as performer; the very notion of upper class (as sketched by the Ascot sequences) is cast as a performance which Â‘liza merely masters. Diction as class as performance as life: a very self-referential playwriting perspective. (Usually, we find it in a more mundane form: actors creating a script by living.) Today, this would have to include the actors acting in at least two dimensions: as the characters in the story and as actors playing them on stage. (Brando did this in 'Guys and Dolls.')

The judgement that Eliza was a Hungarian princess in disguise is more than a mere throwaway joke to make fun of the hapless Zoltan Karpathy (played incidentally by someone with a Hungarian heritage). The notion of Pygmalionian linguistics as both a parsable science and a lever for socialist leveling originated in Budapest. Shaw, being a master of language and student of society was interested in this, and he finally relented in having Pygmalion filmed because the studio promised a Hungarian director.

The notion of linguistics and social determinism is an English obsession: the orthography (phonetic writing) that Higgins uses is derived from the first formal orthography, devised by Thomas Harriot in the 1580s to capture what he thought was a new world magic to be found in the Algonquian (a Native American) language. (The characters are half Kabbalah and half descriptive of mouth shape.) He was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Neither would have thought the English language particularly noble because it used so many French words. Both would have sounded more like the guttersnipe.

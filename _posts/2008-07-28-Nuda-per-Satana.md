I really was disappointed in Hellboy 2, so I sought this one out. Its dissimilar in production values excepting that in both films the photography is competent. The acting and linear element of the story are so laughable that this is often considered one of the worst films in history. 

But it is actually in a pretty serious tradition, following Jesus Franco, in hiding some comparatively intelligent ideas under a pile of sleaze. 

The idea here is much like "Forbidden Planet" and involves a man's encounter with his inner self. This man and presumably all men finds deep pulls on lust and macho pride. Both originate in the devil, who honestly sells a perpetual kingdom of knowledge that runs on sensual tension. Pretty tame stuff, that exploitation card, but what's interesting is the inner journey hook.

That hook depends on a double symmetry: the man is split into a man and a woman, a stranger with whom he falls in love. Ah, but then there is a double reflection where the couple is copied. Its actually a pretty clever notion that you will find it hard to notice.

But once you do, you will likely appreciate this hellboy better than the one in the eponymous films.

It doesn't matter much to me that this movie fails, because its based on a pretty good idea. I assumed when watching it that the Japanese original was better as they typically are. It seems not.

The idea here is one at least as old as Shakespeare: when an actor plays a character, he or she hosts an unnatural soul in the available body. So if you want layered performance, you set up a script where this happens within the story. Its what's called folding, folding in the acting. Clever actors seek these parts, which turn out to be comparatively common.

What to do if you want to go further than anyone has? You introduce sex. Now, sex is also about one body entering another, so this can work, especially if there is some extraordinary tension. The plot provides. The situation here is that a woman's soul is transferred to her sexually active sixteen year old daughter. The man and girl both horny, frisson results.

In fact, this is one of those movies where the description is more interesting than the movie. Things like this are hard to make, especially when you have to conform to the limits of how sex can be played. And of course when you lack basic skills.

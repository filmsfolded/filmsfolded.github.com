Hitchcock -- long after this period -- would develop a notion of the camera that would revolutionize film. He understood this and in "Vertigo" and "Rear Window" was able to find scripts that could be bent to include a comment on this notion. 

And I suppose going back in his work, it is tempting to look for signs of the impending epiphany. Many film historians seem to combine this talent with the earlier ability to sometimes make very good movies.

He did understand cinematic storytelling, and it is clear that a firm basis in this was necessary for later freeing the story. But let's keep things separate. This is crackerjack storytelling. It does have some really bad moments however --Hitchcock never figured out how to handle people at a table. And the use of the locomotive was already hackneyed.

But the way the story is spun is deft. So, if you are interested in a competent but unimportant movie that has some charm and historical context (impending fascism), and you don't care that it has no depth whatever, then this is your ticket.

But don't be fooled into imagined greatness. That would come later when Hitchcock would meet and exchange ideas with Hollywood thinkers.

(There IS that idea of performance as a code though...)

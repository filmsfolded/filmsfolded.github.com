Spoilers herein.

How sad to saddle competent actors with a soulless script and inept direction.

Cat's Eye comments follow:*

This a story about a junior high boy from a broken home and a substance abusing mother. He has been sent back gradewise so is bigger and stupider than his schoolmates. What he sees is some kids getting special treatment, especially one played by H J Osment. This kid really annoys everybody; his special treatment comes from the fact that his Mom (also a drunk, also single) is screwing the teacher.

Our anti-hero is wracked by frustration that exhibits as violence and he eventually kills the imp. The story is made more true by making the center of the film nameless. We see him only a few times.

The novelty is that killing the teacher's pet turns him into a publicly loved saint. That transformation is told by one story line that moves forward and another backward, both meeting at the killing. Hence the title. A clever narrative trick, blunted by unimaginative direction.

*Cat's Eye comments result when nothing intelligent can be conventionally said of a film.

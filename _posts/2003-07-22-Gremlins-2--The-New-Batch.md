Spoilers herein.

Speilberg gets what he deserves in this one, and it is worth seeing just for that.

Here is a movie about movies that any real enthusiast will love. That it involves creepy  muppets is just incidental.

Circumstances contrive to have a cable network taken over by puppets. (There is a tacit  understanding here that everyone knows they are puppets.) These puppets take various  stages and act out various movie cliches, always jokingly. Along the way is a "vampire"  reporter, playing to his audience as the hidden annotators to this do.

Almost every woman here is redheaded (except the legacy of Phoebe). Wonder what that  means?

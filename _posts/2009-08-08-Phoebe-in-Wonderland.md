I collect cinematic experiences based on Alice in Wonderland, which is why I came to this. Most folks find it too much trouble to go to for the unsatisfying resolution. But what interests me is the number of inversions.

We have the movie, essentially a coming of age story of a prepubescent girl, focused on her damaged parents and an influential teacher.

Folded into that is a play (of "Alice in Wonderland"), a book about "Alice" by the Mom, another book, a children's book by the Dad, a mental illness of obsessive compulsive disorder mashed together with Tourette's, a cinematic magical visualization technique, a parallel magical reality with a visitor from the other side, and finally a set of embodied anxieties in the Mom and the marriage. 

All this is is mixed in a way that makes sense, and though it is not particularly strong as an experience, the mix of these folds is impressive. It probably could only have been pulled off using something as deep as "Alice." 

Each of these inner stories becomes in turn the anchor for the others in a sort of round robin, with a very regular period, precisely equal to the periodicity of the Alioce story itself.

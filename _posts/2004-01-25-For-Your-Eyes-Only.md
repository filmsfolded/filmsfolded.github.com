Spoilers herein.

All Bonds are not created equal. 'Goldfinger' was the best because it had room to be  outrageous, to populate a genre. All that come after can only follow the template,  pushing it in moderate ways: faster pace, more stunts, stranger gizmos, but never more  sex.

This is one of the lowest spots in the franchise - both the ski and underwater stuff  would be done much better in subsequent versions of the formula. What makes this one  interesting to me is the small way it pushes the envelope of sex by introducing the  underage BiBi (though she was played by a 22 year old). She is so much more appealing  than the others here it must have been deliberate. After this, they retreat back to the  model that Meyers tweaks.

Spoilers herein.

When looking at older films it is easy to see which were derivative and which original. This was both:

--it really did set a new subgenre of Western. It is really hard to come in on the end of a genre and not resort to parody and irony for a new vision (like the Eastwood trilogy which followed).

--on the other hand, this is a pale copy of a much better Japanese film.

The prancing and posturing here now seems ridiculous, and so much else of the craft of filmmaking is done poorly by modern standards. What makes it work despite this is Elmer Bernstein's score. The music is so classically American that (together with 'The Great Escape') we see the making of American stereotypical heros: McQueen, Coburn; Bronson largely through the music.

See this for its effect on American culture. For a pure experience go elsewhere, first to 'Seven Samuri.'

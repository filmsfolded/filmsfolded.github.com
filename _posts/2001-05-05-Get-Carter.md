Spoilers herein.

IMDB comments often interest me. The consensus here is that this is a bad film. And although I had yet to find a Stallone film I could tolerate, I actually like this one. Strange to swim against popular opinion and support the nitwit.

That's because his other stuff is there only to support him, whatever he is. Here, the film is a visual tapestry that uses him merely as a token. (He plays a gangster who is unknowingly playing a film gangster.)

So the quality of the tapestry is what matters and what appeals to me. There's nothing original here: 'Limey' has more adventure in the perspective-shifting; 'Professional' has more charm in the character; 'Payback,' despite other flaws has deeper reference to prior work; 'Snatch,' though thin stuff elsewise has more energy.

But this has more coherent visual art. What I want first from a film is to transport me to another world. Kay, Fiore and Greenberg do this. My real struggle with this film is how close it comes to the simple craft of pumping out a pop vision, close to a practiced commercial for instance. It's close and one doesn't want to cut Sly any slack, but it still works for me.

At the bottom of this film is another small self-reference: it is about another film, the rape. Another funny thing: the only actor that doesn't work for me is, gasp, Caine. The music during the action stinks.

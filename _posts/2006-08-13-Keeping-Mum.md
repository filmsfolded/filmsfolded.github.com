Its a genre, you know, the unhappy family who gets a quirky visitor, and every ill is healed.

The only things to play with are the nature of the family's ills and the quirks of the visitor. This will prompt presumably amusing episodes.

Since "Visitor Q," I haven't been able to see any of these quite the same, so radical and black was that. Emma Thompson played with the genre and had some interesting success by coordinating acting strokes with a radical set design. Shows she understands how things work and it was unusual.

But this, no. It does have amusing moments, but we know precisely when they are coming because they are set up so conventionally all the effect is less than we expect. Sure, there's a sort of pleasure in the Britishness of how understated everything is (except the obnoxious token American), but you'd have to have a pretty empty life to allow that to justify a couple hours.

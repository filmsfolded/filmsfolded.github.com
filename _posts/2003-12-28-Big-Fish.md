Spoilers herein.

Here we have a folded project: a story about storytelling where life is defined in part by fiction. It is by a one time master of folding, peaking with 'Ed Wood.' It has key actors who understand folding: Lange ('Titus' and mate of folder Shepard), McGregor (started with 'Pillow Book,' then 'Moulin Rouge') and DeVito, the purveyor of comic folding in the tradition of Nabokov, most recently in 'Death to Smoochy.'

Heaviweights all. The story is a common edition, something between 'Baron ' and 'Guinevere,' with more than a dollop of Redford's slick, dumb flyfishing-as-life mentality.

The intent was surely to have the 'stories' and 'real life' overlap, affect each other, and merge like the conjoined twins. If this worked, the labored metaphors would have been fine  we could even have tolerated more. After all, we are dealing with Proust here, the notion that a life is defined by memory  an elaborate life by an elaborate 'story.'

But it doesn't work. I think that is because in film we have such a strong tradition of a framing device. That expectation is so strong that when we have two overlapping stories and one 'generates' the other, you have to pull some fancy tricks to avoid it falling into a static frame, like Falk in 'Princess Bride.'

Burton didn't do this well at all here. This same week, I saw a nearly identically structured project, 'Conceiving Ada.' It failed in exactly the same way. The 'past' story was interesting and fantastic, where the 'present' story was lifeless. This lack of equivalence prevented their intended overlapping.

A real shame. Probably Depp would have helped.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3  Has some interesting elements.

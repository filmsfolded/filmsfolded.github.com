Spoilers herein.

I'm usually a sucker for this kind of thing: dreams about movies, movies about movies,  movies about dreams. This one even begins by referencing the widely recognized  prototype: Valentina Cortese's problems in multiple failed takes in 'Day for Night.'

But if you watch that film, each repetition is from a different perspective as you peel an  onion that is the rationale for the film. This one seems to have none at all except it  would be a hoot for a few actors.

I saw this together with 'Lovely and Amazing' which employs all the same key actors  minus Buscemi. It was coherent and nuanced. This is blunt, blunt, blunt.

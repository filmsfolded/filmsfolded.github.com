I saw this again after a long absence. I like the layers.

Start with an ordinary man. No, perhaps less than ordinary, with banal epiphanies and sophomoric insights.

Have him create a concept album using this wan stuff using the tools of popular music. Not rock. This is closer to Sondheim than Springstein and is the sort of overproduced simple music that U2 does now. Passionless but catchy and with simple thoughts. That's two layers now.

Third, create a stage show to illustrate the music. This is where it really gets interesting because Gerald Scarfe gets involved. You may know him as a talented illustrator, but consider this: At this time he was sleeping with (and would later marry) Jane Asher. You may not know who Jane is, but if screwing Yoko was what killed the Beatles, the best concept band in history -- screwing Jane was what caused it to be born. Jane is the source, or rather sex with Jane is the source of all rock concepts, period.

(Eleanor David, a Jane-like redhead, plays Pink's wife here.)

Gerald drew her labia and made one of the most erotic and terrifying film sequences ever for this stage show. A male flower and a female, both beings in the form of genitals only. She seduces, he complies. She dances the dance of Scheherazade, a thousand stories, nay a billion. He enters boldly. Then she swallows pleasure, thus turning mean and cruel, an engorged dragon. And all but eats our hapless, now limp lad. 

It isn't the way I see the world, no no, but it is an image sequence that you will never, ever forget. That's our third layer and generates the image I want you to see before you die.

Now they all approach Alan Parker to make a movie. Alan is a great imagineer, a risk taker. Someone who knows the edges. Its dull material -- Nazis again -- but he does an okay job. I think he may have had the idea for the masks. Great masks.

Four layers. Four masks. Four labial swallows.

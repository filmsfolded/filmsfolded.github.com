Spoilers herein.

There is indeed a ghostly presence in the American West. It is based on myth, which gives it  power. It destroys without knowing; it depends on magic and belief. Its name is family  Redford.

Yes, good old Robert and now his son are the culprits here. They have a wistful, idealized  vision of a noble people defiled. There Â‘s the evil corporation, the environmental desecration  (which the natives would never have done!) and the conflict between the white and red man's  magic. All set in Hallmark hues spun with an unacknowledged Hollywood mainstream gloss.

It says a lot that this passes for politically correct. Give it a few years before Native  Americans realize that the artificial nobility bestowed by a well-meaning Hollywood (and we  include the Sundancers in this) is just as offensive as the 'mad injun' stuff that preceded it.

I refer the reader to 'Napolean Bonapart' or Bony as he is known in the detective fiction of  Arthur Upfield. Bony is a halfbreed, part white (with an advanced university degree) and part  aborigine, or 'black.' Because he is half black, he has tracking and intuition 'in his blood,'  and a mystical connection with the land. 

These 29 novels - in which the mystical and logical compete and sometimes cooperate -  were popular books just a couple decades ago. Read one to see how offensive it is and why  they are so universally rejected today. Dramatic myth which spins stereotypes is just as  offensive when those stereotypes are 'positive,' and the intent honest even more so because  it patronizes. Now read Bony again and see how closely the current writer Hillerman copies  Upfield, in many details as well as the overall tone.

Stay away from this, unless you just want to appreciate the very fine photography and editing  Dad arranged for his boy.

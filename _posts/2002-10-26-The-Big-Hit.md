Spoilers herein.

I don't know why this didn't get wider circulation. It is one of the best crafted comic-action projects I have seen. The characters are stereotypes for sure, but extreme, quirky versions. 

Designing a film like this is a high art because you need to have a pre-existing notion of where to place your created world. You need to find a niche that hasn't been occupied by others, but it has to be close enough to thousands of other films that you can create humor by the difference. I think this film does that successfully.

It also has two other elements I find notable.

Japanese film (and comic) sexuality relies heavily on the adolescent school uniform, particularly the short skirt and cotton panties. It's roughly the same spot that western film fills with breasts. The team behind this film used that to their comic advantage, explicitly contrasting the schoolgirl type to the whole pantheon of film sex types, including the extraordinarily tight butt.

The other point of interest is the self-reference. It's an interest of mine, especially in films like this. These are films about films. All the humor comes from referencing and tweaking the genre. The writers here include that notion explicitly: the father of the schoolgirl is an aspiring filmmaker who ends up making this film of what happened; there's a running joke about an overdue video and the climax takes place in a video store; one of the hitmen develops an obsession with porn films that is identical to the obsession with action films that underlies the tone of this. 

This film hits the target that I think was intended by 'Boondock Saints.'

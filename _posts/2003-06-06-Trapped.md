Spoilers herein.

Mandoki makes technically fine but unimaginative films. Theron's face and manner is similar. Add the two together with a first time screenwriter and you have something that plods along. But you already knew that dear reader.

When I watch these failures, I look for something interesting and this case got me wondering about Kevin Bacon. I gather that directors like him because he shows up, works his butt off. He isn't 'difficult' and tries to do just what the director wishes. He has been very effective in the past. For instance, Stone is an overbearing director with a clear vision of what he wants. Watch how Bacon responds in 'JFK.' But when the director is weak, he has no ideas - or his ideas don't mesh with the project. That's the case here.

Here's an example: Bacon is clay for director to use. Courtney Love is the exact opposite; she is a character who can be called upon to use only that character in a film. The idea behind the movie is the connections between people at a distance. The 3 Jennings have a sort of telepathy that is in tune, and the opposing 'family' (Marvin as surrogate child) has the same telepathy but it is somewhat out of tune. All the attunements have a physical analogy at the end on the 'road.' This could be the acting opportunity of a lifetime in the right hands; actors love to project outside themselves and they also like to feed each other. But Bacon is without direction, and Love is clueless.

Theron has a prosthetic crooked tooth.

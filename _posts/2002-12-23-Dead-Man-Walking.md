Spoilers herein.

In 1999, Tim Robbins created a wonderful film: textured, self-aware camera, ensemble collaboration, self-referential story. None of the wonderful elements of that film are present here.

In this case, he made a valentine for his wife. The story doesn't exist, only a dramatic situation used as an excuse for the two players. And everything is ruthlessly directed to exploit the relatively small range of Susan. It may be that she really believes in this cause -- I presume she does. But the mechanics at work here are of simple maudlin melodrama, where the characters are swept along by the situation and allowed to posture in comment.

Just as Penn's character is a waste of life (who wastes other lives) so is Penn himself here. He allows himself to be wasted, in an act of unselfishness that only a great actor could accomplish.

There is some genius here: Robbins' control to make his wife look good and Penn's ability to create an unfilled soul. That these were done in the same film is a marvel.

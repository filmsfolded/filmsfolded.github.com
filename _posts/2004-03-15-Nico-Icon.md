Spoilers herein.

No one who survived that period can forget Nico, at least her voice in the midst of sounds  that have come to define what heroin sounds like. She wasn't the only pretty face we saw  get ravaged. But this was the only soul I know that did so as a deliberate act of art. At  least the aura of Warhol claimed it such.

Was she a real musician? It doesn't matter to me, even if there were such a thing. She  became part of my dream life, so is at least worth a revisit or two.

I waited to see this until I could see it with 'Joni Mitchell: Woman of Heart and Mind,' an  equally insipid portrait, but of quite a different musician.

Both Joni and Nico were pretty blond singers, from the same era. Both had kids they had  to give up. Both had lives with drugs and fellow male musicians. In fact, both were in New  York at the same time.

Each had their own demons. But what different music! I'm not sure which was the greater  artist: one gave her life to music while it was the inverse otherwise. Does passion matter!  Was Jim Morrison a waste or a successful ride on an angry beast?

You won't get any of this from the dreary documentary alone. But if you were at all alive  then, this effectively reminds.

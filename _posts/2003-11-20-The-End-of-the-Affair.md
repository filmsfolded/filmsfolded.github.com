Spoilers herein.

I am particularly fond of films that have an 'ordinary' incarnation and are then remade in  an extraordinary way.

The 'Psycho' remake was nearly identical to the original but where the original was about  fiction referencing life, the second could add another layer by referencing the first film's  fiction.

In this film, we have a more extraordinary phenomenon in the remake. This original is in  the tradition of the time: a filmed stage play overlain with noir features. Those noir  elements are humans trapped by fate and an intermediate position of the character (here  both main characters) between audience and character as off screen narrator. In this  original, the all-important diary is just part of that narration.

The acting is also of the teapot variety, made obsolete several years before by  'Streetcar.' Johnson and Kerr's careers would plummet as a result.

The 1999 remake is an entirely different beast, one more like what Greene intended. This  book was written during the filming of 'Third Man.' That film's intent was changed by  Orson Welles and how he approached it. The discussions between Welles and Graham on  reflexive narrative were translated directly into this book.

Where the first film is about people and issues of passion versus faith, the second is  about the fabrication of fiction. 

It is a story about a writer writing itself. Within that story is a woman writing her own  narrative (which Bendrix reads toward the end). Within THAT story is wonder about how  much of both stories are being written by the grand narrator, here played by God... the  well known narrative structure of the 'rule of threes,' recreated best in film in '2001,'  which borrows from this.

Inserted are shifting observers beyond the 3 writers as observers, again by the rule of  threes: the priest, husband and detective. The detective references the original of this  type of literature with Lancelot, whose tale of the archetypical triangle is written -- and  possibly fabricated -- by the god-writer Merlin.

You can't get a better concentrated lesson in modern film than seeing these back to  back.

In the modern one, Julianne Moore supports the layering, just as she did in the 'Psycho'  remake, and the famous layered 'Vanya.' The modern one wisely combines the priest  and atheist and introduces the famous ashtray.

Spoilers herein.

Something cannot be funny if it doesn't engage.

Back before Garrison Keillor, we had Jean Shepherd telling us stories over the radio. There is no storytelling like that on the radio: with reading, you work with the writer to create worlds, but with radio the writer also acts as a tractor to pull you through those worlds. There is nothing at all like radio narrative: your imagination is unconstrained, but the shape of the narrative thread is wholly out of your control.

Garrison's innovation is to interest by opportunistic rambles, where each threaded episode is unresolved and arbitrarily leads to another. This works because we are charmed with the randomness but not unsettled because the settings and characters recur as familiar touchstones. The comfort of the characters and puerile moral offsets the novel narrative construction.

But before that, we had a greater craftsman who resembled this only in the episodic constructions. Shepherd's novelty was to ramble but instead of a focus on making the characters and situations familiar (though they were), he focused on the connections. These connections are unlike anything I have experienced in radio or film: they are the kind of switches in subject you make in daydreaming that you cannot retrace or logically understand but which you know constitute who you really are.

This is abstract, which is essential for humor, but it is as intimately engaging as you can get, which is why it can be so damned funny.

Film merely adds pictures to this mix and takes most of the mechanics away from our much funnier imagination. The kid makes this work as a comedy, but not in the way that Shepherd was strong. And the screenwriter has rearranged things to take away the unlikely connections. I thought this was funny, but if you want genius storytelling, get some old Shepherd tapes.

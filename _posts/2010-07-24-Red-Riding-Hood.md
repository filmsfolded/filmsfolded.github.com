Sometimes a movie is simple but done well. This is the opposite.

It seems to have been shot in a weekend with pickup players except for the girl who was obviously selected for her face. Superficially, it is a giallo, with explicit murders, usually with knives. Like a traditional giallo, sex plays a role, though here is it the strangely handled awakening of a young teen. But, like with Argento projects, there is a deliberate attempt at complex narrative structure.

The mystery is not in discovering the answer at the end of the story, but the shape of the question.

The thing is framed by our girl telling the story of Red Riding Hood to her grandmother in bed, "as the wolf would tell it."

That is nested above and below some detailed discussion of "Don Qixote" from the girl to her tutor, who she adores. We are told about the honor and the fictional world of the guy. She lets him and us know she is Qixote.

The story we see weaves among these. Basically, she prowls the streets of Rome, where she lives alone, and kills people she thinks do not deserve to live. There are drills, nailguns and stuff typical of the referenced genre. In each case, she does not do any of the violence, her companion does. His name is George. He wears the same outfit: black cape, red shoes, and follows her bike on his. But he is six feet tall and wears a stylized wolf mask. He is the violent one.

There are events, but they matter not at all except to sustain this structure. There is also a backstory to help it make some sort of sense: her father was a crusading Washington politician murdered in public by a young girl. Her mother -- who we never see -- was cheating with a younger guy and abandoned her.

The daughter somehow ends up living alone in Rome with money and profound cleverness. Her Grandmother comes to take her back to New York. The grandmother is a famous stage actress, allowing some talk about the nature of performance. Some movies are mentioned, others are referenced. It seems essential to the genre that these ideas which can be deep are handled in the most superficial way, as a preteen girl would.

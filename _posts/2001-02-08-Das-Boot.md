Spoilers herein.

The best films -- very few -- understand how to use space. Included among all the other things to worry about is how the space on the screen relates to the viewer. Welles' 'Othello' is a masterpiece because the way he peers through the space, he places the viewer in the set, makes us part of the emotional weave.

This film is perhaps the best architectural film of this era. The bar is much lower when you deal with a single space that we conceptually understand coming into the theater. But this team really understood how to let us know what is behind us, and thus puts us in the sub. There, we are subject to the same fate as these men, and relate to events more viscerally.

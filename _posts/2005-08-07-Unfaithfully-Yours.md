Preston Sturges drives me a little crazy. He has such great ideas, builds such terrific conceptual layers, innovates in such original ways...

And then tosses stupid, ordinary humor all over it as if to say that this precious porcelain vase was created only to display a crude dirty joke on it.

And he has an amazing lack of ability to differentiate his levels of abstraction with different tones. Usually anyway.

In this case, he has three different levels. There's the level we start out with: the man, an emotional genius who comes to believe his wife is cheating on him.

Then we have a second level, literally what is going on in his mind while conducting. He is watched by an audience while we -- another audience -- watches the movie within. Three movies: he kills her and frames the lover, he forgives, he kills himself.

There is some distance between these two levels, The second is deftly choreographed to match the music being played while the story is imagined.

Then we have the third level. It is a comic layer over top of the other two. This is broadly comic, from a different world. It is differentiated a bit by comic music and odd sound effects. But not enough to work.

And you have to be really wanting to laugh to think this is amusing at all.

But the construction is so novel, so perfect, so transporting (despite the hammy acting) that we forgive it all. This is an important movie.

This is a Hollywoord film about a young woman who comes to Hollywood to become an actress. She sees Marion Davis and wants to become like her. She is, of course, played by Marion Davis. 

She is a genuine character who becomes a success on screen because of that genuine character. Then she begins to play an aristocrat in "real" life, at which point her genuine appeal is lost and she is nearly fired.

Now, appreciate the layers: Marion Davis the actress plays someone who is not an actress who is successful be cause she is not playing, but then who plays a role in non-character life (and who we see sometimes as Marion Davis poking fun at herself) and becomes not an actress by acting.

Along the way, many real actors are featured as themselves, and the director of this plays the director of the movie within.

The amazing thing of course is that we readily understand these layers. Viewers nearly a hundred years ago did. Its called folded narrative.

The title of course is a pun. Its about showing people in show business.

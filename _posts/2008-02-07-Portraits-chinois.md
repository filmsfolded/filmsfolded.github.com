This is a rather sublime movie if you think of it as the other half of "Fight Club." Its where the Helena Bonham Carter character came from, a banal empty movie with a similar structure.

The structure here is a group of men involved in movies, and young women mostly involved in the fashion industry. Each worries about their own types of stories. The two overlap in terms of profession. And of course the central part of the thing is how they engage each other in relationships. Swaps and disappointments. At the center of all the human dynamics is Ada, played by Helena.

She loses her man, the filmmaker and toward the end he makes a film of the experience, with the intent of getting her back. He does.

All this small folding is supposed to charm us in simple ways. There's talk about the film within the film, about it being a failure because it has the qualities of the film we see. There's talk about a woman dress designer wanting to design a dress that by itself can eliminate the pain men cause women. There's the implication, typically French, that love is a matter of defining self.

Its not sharp. Its not illuminating, its just quiet, somewhat structured wondering about love with an artificially happy ending.

You'll do well to see this before Fight Club.

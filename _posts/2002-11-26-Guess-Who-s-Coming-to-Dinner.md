Spoilers herein.

Yes, a clash of cultures, but not black and white. The matter of race is the thinnest of veneers here, and isn't seriously treated at all, even by 60's standards.

No, why this picture fails is because what we have here is a clash of film and theater cultures.

A major thread in theater is to moralize, indeed our tradition of English drama began that way, and it is only because of the extraordinary influence of Shakespeare that we have anything else. Many, many dramas moralize, and this has continued in the film world when the movie is merely a filmed play. That's exclusively the case in action films and films for children. Nearly always the bad guys get their due. But many times, the conventions of moral theater are more obvious and that's the case here. The climax is the hackneyed gathering of all the characters into the main room of the home for a speech which contains the moral. All else is contrived to set up that speech.

So on the one hand, we have here the culture of moral theater which perpetuates itself with an unkillable memetic tenacity. What's the other culture?

Romantic film. This is a child of the romantic pulp novel which invented the common concept of 'love.' This kind of love now lives exclusively in film. This kind of love supposes that there are fore-ordained couplings, and that when these two first meet, there is an instant irresistible bond. This is a love everlasting (but it could be forgotten) -- there is no other kind to come. This is an escapist dream world that moviegoers cannot cleanly sort out from the richer real world. It has its own memetic drivers, even stronger than the theatric preaching. Redhaired women are often associated with this world.

Some theorists convincingly argue that many of the woes of modern nations stem from what we have piled into this unrealistically romantic film world, once we allowed it is is real, and confabulated it into our own existence: matters of race, 'rights,' destiny...

In this film, we have the clash of these two cultures which co-exist in film: on the one hand, we have the irresistible tendency to locate a problem, crystallize it, fabricate a rousing speech, and then all sit down together in a Calvinist harmony. On the other hand, we have the even greater tendency to imagine a world of personal love that trumps all matters, ALL matters. Guess which world is coming to dinner?

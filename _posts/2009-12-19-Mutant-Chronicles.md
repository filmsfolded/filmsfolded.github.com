I saw this with "Ink," which had much the same ambitions. These films both had an epic ancient battle cast in fantasy, borrowing images, stereotypes and tropes to move things along. They both had women warriors and high SF ambitions with low budgets and steam- punk technodesigns.

But Ink was inspired, elaborate powerful storytelling. And this is just a bunch of story parts tossed into a bucket. These chronicles are mutant. It seems that the filmmakers decided to use an existing graphic novel template. So far so good, the emerging cinematic vocabulary is inherently visual. Rodriguez found a graphic novel that had most of the narrative in the images. He could mine it.

But this seems to have been based on a comic where all the story is in some text, and the pictures are just there as extra stuff for those with lazy imaginations. What narrative power that story might have had is lost, would have been even if the cinema wasn't incompetent. That makes the unimaginative borrowing from the simpleminded patterns unacceptable.

I had hoped that at least the imagination behind creating the world and "the machine" would have some appeal. Nope. There is a rich promise in such large scale orrery-like machines. What we have here are some gears and occluding darkness.

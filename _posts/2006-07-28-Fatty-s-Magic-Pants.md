If you want to understand your wife, you need to understand her parents. If you want to understand movies, you need to rummage around in these old things. Mack Sennett is key.

This little project is unimportant, except in context.

Guns as funny. Pantless men at parties as funny. Dispirited fat men as funny. Pretty girls as worth any risk Â– well, that's a timeless universal.

But here was the funniest man in movies before Chaplin, with his wife, doing his funniest bits. There's little more important in the root of the food chain.

So in a way, you won't have any fun with this until you see almost anything afterward that has physical comedy. Then the mirrors in your visual memory will reflect back to this stuff that you've hung in there; and you'll find yourself chuckling deeper.

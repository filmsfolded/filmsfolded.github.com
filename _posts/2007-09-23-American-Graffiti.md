This is one of the movies that started me on my great adventure in what I call "folding," what you might prefer to think of in other terms.

On the surface, this is what it seems to be: an evocation of a car-centric teen culture that was already disappearing in 1973, and is now either completely gone or transmuted into a branch of simple consumerism. Its very well made, and since its a reference to things past, its even more powerful now than 30 years ago. That's three times longer than the distance from when it was made to the period to which it refers.

When I saw it, I wondered why it worked so well, and I believe it had something to do with the way the episodes are linked. Sure, they're linked by cars, but deeper than that they are linked by the shared world they inhabit served up through the car radios. All the stories are built on this spine; all the references to ideals are ideals that come through the radio.

Here's what I subsequently learned: one of the writers used explicitly what I am calling folding to give the thing power. Just as we are expected to let the film seep into our world and tie together episodes we carry -- and just as this film is intended to supply small stories as target stories for life... so is the radio show within the story. Its designed that way, so as we see the radio show influence, even create parts of the world for who we see, the movie automatically inherits that role, more deeply for us.

Its why we had to have that episode about the blond in the T-bird, unapproachable, and finally left behind by the "smart guy" who -- in order for the folding to work -- becomes the writer-in-LA, who presumably pens what we have seen.

Its a simple example of the technique. Oh, there are complex elaborations, like the business about Wolfman Jack not being "real" but in tape.

Powerful, still powerful.

The writers wanted to include the women in the report on futures at the end, so here goes.

Carol tried serial marriage, laconic suicide, and lazy adventure. She's a substance abuser, and has been since two years after we see her. She still has the gearshift knob and appeared with it in a porn video in 1984. When clean, she is a highly sought speaker on lucid feminism, and has three bestsellers.

Debbie attached herself to four successful artists, each of whom left her on their success. She is currently working as a cocktail waitress, living in Los Angeles and active in the cat rescue program with the local SPCA. Debbie has lupus. She has a new name and is estranged from her three children.

Laurie married young, stayed in town, had a successful career with the city and is the unhappiest of the three. Her husband is in real estate.

The girl in the Thunderbird became a shill for stupid products on TeeVee.

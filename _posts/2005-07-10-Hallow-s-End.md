Gosh, another great idea pummeled into the ground by inept film-making.

No one needs to recount the ways this fails. But what it has that's clever is worth talking about.

Horror isn't about horrible things so much. Its about frightening the audience, and the best way to do that is to engage the audience in the story. The most common way is to "fold" the audience into the story somehow. 

And the easiest way to do THAT is to have the movie start out being a show and turn REAL.

That's what we have here: some dumb teenagers dress up as actors in a haunted house show. Then by some curse, they actually become their scary characters.

Could have worked if the filmmaker had a clue. By the way, when this is done deftly, it doesn't matter if the actors or effects are good. After all, it is only a show, right?

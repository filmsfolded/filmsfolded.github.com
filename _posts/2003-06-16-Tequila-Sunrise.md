Spoilers herein.

This film is at root a mess, another rehash of the buddies who end up on opposite sides  of the law. Naturally, they compete over the same female trophy. Drugs, stupid cops  bossing a breezy detective. These are all trotted out as the formula requires. Ho hum. I  suppose the producers thought that attractive Mel and Michelle would gloss over the  vapid framework. At least they are early enough in their careers to energetically try.  Later, they would simply show up. (Michelle obsesses over her unattractive neck and here  has hair that is the perfect solution.)

But behind the machinations of the product, two fine craftsmen do their work. Sadly,  both are now gone. Conrad Hall does the cinematography. You can see how blunt the  director is in how things are blocked and how crafty Hall is in getting around those  limitations, even exploiting them. My favorite example of this is Mel answering the phone  after predictably bedding Michelle and leaving her in the trailer. Upstairs, pooltable, the  Carlos-twist, are all visually conveyed.

And then there is Carlos himself, an actor leagues beyond everyone else we see and a  character more fulfilled. Raul knows how to act a man that acts, how to live large in a  body that is living large and to have the two largenesses interact internally. A fine man.  Two fine men: one the tequila, one the sunrise.

Ted?s Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.

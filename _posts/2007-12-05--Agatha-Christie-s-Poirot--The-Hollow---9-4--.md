Gosh. Sometimes a production is completely overwhelmed by the performers. Its particularly noticeable in Christie projects, where nuances in the story are supposed to matter; we worry about every detail and essential to that is our immersion in what Poirot sees (plus other stuff we see and learn). But in this case, a central character is played by Sarah Miles.

If you have an interest in movie personalities, Sarah is a sort of Jane Birkin, a figure behind the scenes who was a muse of sorts in some important projects. These women are the hidden cosmos of sex, romance, partnership for some of our finest film experiences. Sarah and Jane both were in "Blow-up." Sarah was Ryan's daughter. There are stories about her that seem magical. We don't see much of her in film, but here she's all over her character and pulls the whole enterprise into a fireworks show while Suchet putters around on the ground. By the end, we feel as her character says; we just don't care who the murderer was.

Here's the oddest. Her husband is played by the fellow that played Dr. Watson to Jeremy Brett's Holmes. Its at least the highest regarded of the Holmes series. But that husband character is a nitwit. The real person that takes care of the family in the story is the butler. He's played by Edward Fox who is interchangeable in manner and appearance for his brother, James. Sarah had a famous affair with James before marrying Robert Bolt the first time.

Its a strange experience watching this because the backstory mirrors the story of the movie so closely in terms of artistic initiative.

She's something. The BÃ©atrice Dalle -- I suppose -- of the last great generation.

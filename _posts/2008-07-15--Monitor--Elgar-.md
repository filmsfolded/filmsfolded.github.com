Taste is a very strange thing, among the strangest. It fascinates, especially when I encounter something that repels me that many people like. Smart people or apparently so. And the encounter is through film.

This is such a thing. It features the music of Elgar. His music is vapidly florid, like cheap, loud perfume. Like tooled leather on a carriage just there to fill the space with decoration. But was a credible entrant in a national competition when all symphonic music was such, and so became a British champion, not unlike a soccer player. These national feelings color the love of the music, establishing it as normal. Its why Constable is venerated. Its not that he was great or even notable artist, but dammit he painted England!

Along comes Ken Russell, a young filmmaker. From his later work, we know he is a man of overblown excess, of cheap shapes and trick colors. So it is no wonder that he was drawn to music of the same ilk. If you don't like snippets of this music, you won't like the film, because that is the core of it.

They are excepted and played all out of context, and the fact that it doesn't matter is remarkable. There is no long form musical narrative, no development, just rosy conversation. While listening, we see an illustrated life, partly re-enacted.

Its dreadful, every bit of it. And highly regarded all around. 

Why? Its a mystery, a beautiful mystery.

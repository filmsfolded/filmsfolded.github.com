Of my nearly 3,000 comments, the negative one for this episode gets repeatedly deleted.

I assume it is someone associated with the show.

So this time I will merely say it is an excrescence without giving details.

It is doubly so because its creators are afraid to let it live in the environment of viewers, and insist on eliminating negative observations.

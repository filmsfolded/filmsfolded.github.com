It used to be fun, playing with the notion of cars and hillbillies. Mix in some innocent sex and innocent speeding, and it was harmless enough. This was in the days before Nascar, country music and Republican politics became marketable items.

It was "Mayfield" with boobs and cars, and made its way to the screen in the form of the Cannonball movies.

All we had to do in the past was establish our boys as good, honest, simple souls, then put them through some minor adventure.

So now we have one of the more interesting remake challenges of the year. How do you take the essence of something that is obsolete now and make it fresh?

You could make a car movie, but it'd be hard to beat "Fast and Furious" and remain dumb. You could make "Sooper Troopers," I suppose. That would be suitable. They went halfway between the TeeVee show and Sooper.

Here's the problem. With humor you have to engineer the distance among the the target, the narrator/joker and the viewer. The best humor sets the distances of this triangle equal, usually by intuition. The worst humor reduces all three to the same. This makes that mistake.

Spoilers herein.

I have a particular fondness for films that spread out over many plots and characters.  There are all sorts of reasons to do so. Scoping out why one would do this and figuring  why it works if it does is a sweet pleasure. Often (not here) the stories include stories  about just such figuring.

One reason to spread the story is simply because you can and that you can make the  mechanics of passing the thing we watch. In its time, 'Nashville,' then 'Short Cuts' was  shocking just because they had short cuts. We noticed the varieties and switching more  than the episodes themselves.

'Bug' follows that tradition but these days you have to really emphasize the transitions  because we have gotten so used sliced and diced narrative. So we have this Rube  Goldbergian machine that is itself the focus of this project.

Life is as much a matter of passing energy as it is at stewarding. Okay as an idea, but  after an hour, the novelty doesn't grab us any more.

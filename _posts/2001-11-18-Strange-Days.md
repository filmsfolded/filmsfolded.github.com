Spoilers herein.

I'm a scifi fan, and I can find something to like in most any film. But this one really surprised me. The parts that were good were excellent, but most of it TeeVee quality. That's network TeeVee quality.

It has poor production values, essentially no art design, a vapid 'future' world, and a banal story -- bad cop conspiracy for chrissake. The style is more 'Escape from LA' than 'Bladerunner,' and one can see Cameron's unsophisticated fingerprints all over it.

It gets extra points from me because of the self-reference: a film about making films. I collect these, but the form of self-reference used here is neither very original nor well developed. But there are some POV sequences that are the best I've ever seen.

POV shots are incredibly hard to do and to make a meaningful part of the narrative structure. They didn't really try here, instead made an excellent piece that has nothing at all to do with the narrative and placed it at the beginning as a kickstarter. Then ordinariness sets in on the world presented.

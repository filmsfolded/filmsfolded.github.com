Take a date movie and mix it with a movie about making a movie. Dose it with a notion of homemade opportunism. 

Does it matter if it engages? If the guy matters? Probably not.

The standard date movie has three acts: The fantasy is established, the fantasy is dashed, the romance is achieved. Often a guy with problems and a perfect girl, sometimes the other way around.

That's what we have here, almost as if it were scripted. It is almost too perfect. Surely, Drew's production company added and sorted things after they got involved.

If you like metamovies, you'll get a bang out of this. If you get embarrassed by ultradorky dumb people, so dumb they should hide, if bad production values bother you, stay away.

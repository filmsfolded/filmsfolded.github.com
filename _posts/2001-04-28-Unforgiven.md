Much is made of this film, because it appears to be a western, and because Eastwood starred in some rather important 'Spaghetti Westerns.' Some call it the antiwestern as if it were conceived by Clint to be an intelligent escalation from the ideas of 'Good, Bad.' But Clint wasn't responsible for the intelligent conception of the Leone films. This film grows more out of science fiction than westerns, and the responsible party is the writer, not the director.

This isn't to take away from some fine photography and smart pacing. But one only has to look at other films from this director and cinematographer to see that they are not geniuses. No, the real novelty comes from Peoples. I assume he figured if 'Star Wars' could appropriate the old fashioned western, then he could appropriate old fashioned scifi values and toss them in western dress.

Check it out. This is the 'Blade Runner' and 'Twelve Monkeys Guy.'

If you ever doubt the destructive power of institutions, engage yourself to this. Its in the story of course, but the more powerful effect is in the being of the thing.

Start your expectations with the lauded films of Yimou Zhang, in particular "Hero." Similar movies have been successful. Now make a list of all the elements in those films, particularly the unique and extensive use of space, color, perspective, time. 

Now do what Hollywood does, shuffle all these components into a formula. Get a trusted mainline filmmaker to walk through the formula. The sponsoring institution, in this case the Red Army (the largest commercial entity in the world) doesn't know about the power of an individual artist, the soul of a created communication, the coherence of a striver's vision. No, what matters is that all the measured qualities are present in the recipe.

If you watch this, the story may seem disjointed, especially in the edited US release. It isn't so, it only appears so because the cinematic devices are so disjointed, almost as bad as the different dream scenes in "The Cell." The story itself is okay.

But it is a thuggish thing overall, in assembly, coming from the mentality of the bad guy's government. It shares only certain movie poster features with "Hero." 

But. And yet. It has perhaps one of the richest opening scenes I have ever experienced, so folded, so dear, so unforgettable. Spatial, fully imagedriven. Full, full full. Colored pathos, lacquered noir. All the excesses of what follows are avoided in those first few moments, until the little girl makes her promise and goes off walking across the water and we see the titles. I believe I would have paid six dollars for that alone. I suspect it was largely filmed before the big financing was sought.

And though it is blown, there's a magical notion in our enchanted princess being imprisoned in a golden birdcage and rescued by being made to fly by the man she loves but doesn't know. The idea is more beautiful than the execution, but is beautiful nevertheless.

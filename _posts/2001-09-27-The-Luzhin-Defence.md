Spoilers herein.

Nabokov is one of the three masters of self-referential narrative. Some of his books are life-altering. This is one of his more accessible ventures into the domain of mad narrative reflected in random reality. He uses the Carroll-esque notion of order from chess as the deistic attractor. The story captures the madness of mathematical inspiration that eludes so many stories of this type (like the cartoonish 'Will Hunting').

Greenaway could have worked with this: the obsessive notes, the 'prayerful' sense of order and counting, the constant projection into the future, the solitary dancing, the love by indirection (and the mirrored puppeteering of the rejected surrogate father), the soft moves.

Someone else (Kubric?) could have worked with the notions of Russians in fascist Como and the reflection of those forces in the competing styles in the games of the champions. The game for the soul of the world (and the win by forfeit of the forces of suave repression).

Turturro is capable of handling this. His career is already remarkable and he is near the top of my list of actors worth collaborating with as a viewer. He _could_ have handled this if there were a shred of Nabokov in this film. Alas, a Merchant-Ivory ordinariness dominates as a chaotic attractor for weak filmmakers.

Watson has already overplayed the power of her raw commitment to her characters and now has to exercise simple craft. She may be up to it in the Nabokov vision, since the lover is an accidental artifact of random life. But in this redaction, she is a fairly complex creature, motivated by more than human drivers of the story. But no one involved seems to know who she was, so she just draws on her Waves, Ashes and Cradle characters: victims, not goddesses.

Spoilers herein.

Bruce again. Winking at the audience again. Collective hostage again. Stunts again, but this film is altogether different than the first one. That's because Renny is at the helm. I admit that of the exclusively action directors, Renny strikes me well. He insists on lightness in the characters. No actor plays straight. All have a brightness. Decidedly lowbrow, but easy to read, almost incidental. 

The stunts are each directed as an arc, each pretty well unified. Lots of fireballs. Lots of vertical space. Pretty good variety in camera coverage.

This is the airplane one, the one with the fax joke.

I suspect that everyone will find either this or the first their favorite, depending on their philosophy of film. This one is cleaner. The first was more innovative, more personal and made clever use of space.

Spoilers herein.

Films are about images; horror films moreso. Sets and effects are there only to create powerful, ideally lasting images. The images should transport, and in the case of horror, transport to a really uncomfortable place.

To say that de Bont doesn't think this way is an understatement. He's a cinematic thug. There's a great tradition of making architectural films, of making a building a character. 'Shining' is in this tradition, preceded by 'Usher' and 'Pendulum' in the horror genre.

It is possible to have a flashy environment to no effect ('The Cell'), to have terror by not showing much of the environment ('The Cube'), to have a truly scary environment in a non-scary film ('Casper'). I'm not kidding about Casper, check it out -- a true master of form designed that mansion.

I see this film as a parody of itself. The builder of the mansion, Crain, overdid it because of inept, misguided, overblown power, which is also the story of de Bont.

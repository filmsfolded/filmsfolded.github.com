Spoilers herein.

There are two kinds of films: those that are inherently plays which focus on the action and those that are inherently cinematic and focus on the audience -- or more precisely how the audience sees and interprets the action. And of those there are two types: the 'art' film where the exploration of eye is explicit and the 'popular' film, where it is all done in the service of amusement. We have here that last type. I find this type even more interesting than the art films I seek out. 

There my being is challenged, my mind stretched. With popular films, by definition, all challenges are avoided. And that's precisely why I find this so interesting. It means that the cinematic vocabulary of the eye has moved past pretension to become part of ordinary life.

The story is a tossaway: vacuous, selfish being develops attachments. The magic of the film is all in how the camera is used: extremely self-aware, often providing annotative asides (aided by the voiceover narration), frequently breaking the 'third wall.' There is nothing new here. These director brothers are just following the filmschool vocabulary of the active camera.

But it _does_ make the project because that's just the stance Hornby takes in his books: they are not about people but about people looking at themselves. 'High Fidelity' solved the problem -- how to present explicit selfexamination --- differently but competently. Voiceovers were used but to different end. The metalayer was the sound track, in fact the story was about creating the sound track. Some camera adventure was used -- like the alternative versions of Robbin's visit -- but they were slight.

Here, a different approach is used. I think it is more apt to Hornby's style which is similarly 'popular' in being casual. Advanced ideas put to vacuous use.

Spoilers herein.

The basics of film boil down to only a few key considerations, the solutions to which can  become impressively nuanced. One of the basics is to figure a strategy to locate the viewer in  the story, ideally in a way that engages them. If the engagement is strong, the rest of the  project need not be so.

Here is one strategy that worked: make the viewer mad and have him/her come to the same  conclusions as the main character while he is. As obvious as it seems in retrospect, this  simple strategy was unplumbed - at least in this way - until the inappropriately titled  'Death Wish.'

That alone would not be remarkable enough to comment upon. But in this case, the  engineering is similarly transparent, and shows some nice self-referential folding.

Self-referential films are films about films. A common substitution for a filmmaker in such  projects is an architect. There may be more film architects than real architects. Our hero is  an architect to whom bad things happen, oddly mild by today's standards. In fact, this kind  of film is impossible today because there is no violence that can get an R rating that would  enrage us as this did 30 years ago.

Here's the self-referential folding: he goes away and watches a 'movie' (a re-enactment) of  western justice. Its a film within the film, and a typical one at that, the western. While he  watches this film, we watch him watching it and we come to the same conclusion at the same  time. Simple, but effective. He then folds the western movie into an urban justice one.

Think this wasn't done deliberately? What do the first punks that he encounters right before  the fold actually happens? 'That was the worst f-ing movie...'

To pull this off, we have to have police from an urban crime movie, and they have to act so  stereotypical that we can do no other thing but recall that genre. Sure enough, the cops here  are cartoons of a specific kind.

Other 'audience' members - the general citizenry - are depicted to help with the effect.

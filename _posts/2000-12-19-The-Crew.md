Film creates such strong milestones in our culture that it is a major force in how we see ourselves. Bloom said of Shakespeare that he invented humanity, but in film we invent a culture. Studies show for instance that gangsters really don't feel like gangsters unless they adapt mannerisms wholly synthesized in the film world. Native Americans are reinventing themselves from the ignorant savage found in early films to the equally artificial noble romantic found later. Marriages flounder on the difference between reality and film-induced expectations.

So the coolest thing is watching actors make fun of these roles by using the very same techniques against them. The best was watching Brando poke his Godfather in that otherwise stupid iguana movie. Also fun watch watching Deniro and Hoffman unknowingly struggle with this in 'Wag the Dog.'

I'm told that actors love this. They get to play with already invented character traits. The less original the better. That's why this was made. It is a minor film in itself, but its some fun watching some moderately accomplished actors do ensemble stereotyping. It was written this way, that's why the plot has them faking.

Burt Reynolds used to be a great comic actor. Not here.

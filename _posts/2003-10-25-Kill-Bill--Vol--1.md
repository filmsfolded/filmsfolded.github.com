Spoilers herein.

The title of the comment is from the ersatz master who makes a new sword for our  avenger. This denotes what is wrong about this film, indeed why Tarantino is to film as  Brittany Spears is to music.

Martial arts are about generational wisdom, about the rigidity of the masters all the way  back empowering new freedom all the way forward. When a fight occurs, it is not the  weapons that are in combat, not even the combatants: it is the respective masters who  operate through time and space. Ang Lee understood this when he made his film, one  that could reliably called an homage.

This is something else, wholly Americanized. Here we have a setup that is from cold war  60's culture, a themed assassination squad. The focus is on the individual. When Uma's  character fights, it is in the Eastwood/Segal tradition. This is Yankee individualism  filtered through episodic TeeVee and only then cloaked in B-movie style.

For all this to work, we have to have a God. Can be the noir god of detached fate; can be  the Hitchcock/dePalma god of the camera; can be the Lynch god of the filmmaker's  angst; can  be the Leone god of irony, or the Fellini god of parallel dreams, or Medem of animated  orgasm, or Bergman of the Judge. Our man Q wants them all, and has to cut each of  them to  make room for the others. He is not clean and focused like Kurosawa, but jumbled like  Rob Zombie.

'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' has identical aspirations, but Rodriguez steeps us in  something he actually knows, leverages an actor that actually understands irony (not  some second rater; remember Mrs Peel and Poison Ivy?), clearly identifies his god/ observer (Depp), and does it all himself: writing, directing, shooting, editing, composing.  In comparison, Quentin is a novice and this is a dim conversation in a lonely corner of an  effete Hollywood party.

As in all of life, there are two kinds of people in film. I'll call them engineers and  scientists. Engineers work with known vocabularies and principles. They take insights of  others and tinker about with different combinations to accomplish certain practical  goals. There is an imagination of sorts, but it extends only so far as understanding the  storehouse of components supplied by others. 

The scientists go where no one else has ever gone, into the void and bring back new  reality that they convince us to accept. Which of these you choose for your life in film  could determine everything about you, because you live in your imagination. Compare  'Ghost Dog' (or even 'Pillow Book') to 'Kill Bill.' Both are about themselves, cast in terms  of what went before. One is subtle, even elusive in its truths. Possibly, it is only one of  many stories it is about as the little girl within it reads. The other, 'Bill' is already chewed  for you. Brittany Spears. They even use the same musician as composer. One is subtle  and rich, the other a jukebox.

Kurosawa is a scientist; Tarantino a shopkeeper, and that brings me to my final point.  Quentin does have terrific storytelling skills. But look at how they are used. All of his  attention goes to explaining what happened before, including the trademarked

timefolds. This is very well done and completely comprehendible. But good storytelling,  the really good stuff, is about what happens NEXT. See any of that here?

Nope, just sugared breakfast cereal.

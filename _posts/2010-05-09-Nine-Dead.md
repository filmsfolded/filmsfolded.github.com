We used to have something in film: the courtroom. 

This was a place where the filmmaker could toy with the narrative, how it was told, revealed, obscured. He could use words and remain cinematic. He could speak directly to us as if we were part of the on-screen audience. This has been reinforced and elaborated in thousands of ways. It is as essential to film as the family dinner and car chase.

But it had roles that were too clear for the way those narrative effects are evolving. We cannot have a judge be discrete and simple. The folks making the argument; those telling the stories... It is too discrete. We want today to have everything start in an unresolved mode. We won't know who the judge is, who the accused, who the detective. 

I think that is where this has come from. The brutality is incidental and in fact here relatively mild. It is all about taking that trial device to the next level. It is, essentially all talk, all testimony. We still have vestiges of the trial: we have a judge, cops, crooks, a priest, a victim. We still need the twist on justice at the end. Both the need and the twist are conventional. But this business of the modern trial where the jury, accused and discoverers are mixed. That is new. It is darn exciting.

I'm not sure whether we can have this in tens of thousands of films, but there is something intelligent going on here.

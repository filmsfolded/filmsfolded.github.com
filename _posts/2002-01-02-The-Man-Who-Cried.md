Spoilers herein.

This film has been on several of my must-see lists. 

--This is Sacha Vierny's last film, he who photographed my favorite Greenaway films (and 'Marienbad') thus creating a goodly part of my mind.

--I knew it to be a film about the film business, a special, folded self-reference that I particularly love.

--It has Blancett and Turturro, two masters at firecrackery; it has Depp who like Pitt fascinates me in the risks he takes. I'm watching Ricci closely: she lacks the talent of the others but seems especially intelligent and may turn out to be this generation's Dennis Hopper. And here she and Depp are lovely. The mix of two internal actors (Depp and Ricci) with two external ones (Blancett and Turturro) indicated particular sensitivity to the actors' space. I had also heard of the luminous child that plays Fegele.

--Sally Potter is not known to me, but she has an excellent reputation as one savvy with the mechanics of performance, especially through movement. I was thinking she would be more like Julie Taymor. Silly me.

I expected the story to be weak; that is the price you pay when acting and self-reference take precedence. But I was hoping for more 'Illuminata' and less 'Sunshine.' What I did get was an honest, somewhat novel but not engaging film about song and ways of singing. 

I think I would have liked it if Potter didn't try to have it both ways in the reality department. Of course she would not know that 'Moulin Rouge' would set a new standard for reality-based, fantastic self-reference.

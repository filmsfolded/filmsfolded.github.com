Spoilers herein.

I'm not sure why this was made excepting the author was a bigwig with influence in the sponsoring organization. It has some charm, some atmosphere, a few amusing characters (a couple lovely women) and of course an innocent's discovery of lust. But pretty tepid stuff, all elements have been done better elsewhere.

But I suppose the Scots need to practice, and this is tolerable enough.

I really would like to talk you into seeing this. Its not the best movie. It is tepid visually, and there are some rough spots in the story proper.

But its a perfect example of the writing principles I have been studying, a perfect example of how they can be applied and work even in a pop situation.

The principle of folded narrative is simple. You somehow establish a way for the viewer to be in the story, and work certain well established mechanisms so that you watch the story and yourself watching the story. The primary effect is that you get deeper into the story, and that matters when genres and archetypes force a blase watching habit.

The watcher in here is a little girl, the daughter to whom is presented not one but three romances. She doubly folds it from a romance (a VERY strict genre) to a mystery (our other most strict genre). So, if you were a writer wondering how to be fresh in a genre that makes tons of money but which is worn out, this is what you do.

You fold three ways: The inner narrator-teller, the genre folding, and the folding of story as the mystery. 

This last is the most clever because all three women are created as ideal endings. In typical mystery fashion, we are fooled as the "real" solution keeps reversing and doubling back. Its a simple mapping between who is the murderer and who is the bride, keeping nearly all else the same.

Incidentally: a blond, a brunette and a redhead, all desirable partners for the ending. Who do you think ends up as the story?

Well, that comes from yet a fourth fold: a very clever folding.

We have the story we see. We have the story that once told to the daughter, she knows will win the romance once told to the love interest. It is conflated with a specific copy of a book, and thence to the story in that book, one of three templates for romance movies ever since. The return of the book has been used before and recently (but I forget the movie's name). But here, the folds go all the way down: The story is merged with the physical book, which is merged with the story told, and further merged with the story we see and the feeling of love we take away. This business of immutable soulmates.

Why I'm so excited about showing you this is precisely because it isn't great. The writer is not a genius, in fact he's done some rather awful stuff. No, this is simply someone going to school to learn what works now, what the state of the art is, and applying it to a manufactured product.

Oh, and make no mistake about whether this is a girlie movie. Its a date movie targeted at guys. Three choices? 

If you want to learn how your inner narrative of love works, you'll do the same.

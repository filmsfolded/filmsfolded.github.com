The difficulties of film!

Superficially, film is theater with larger visual scope. But theater is the child of literature, at least English-speaking theater. And film is offspring of some other part of our imaginative being. Literature and theater generally rests uneasily in film, that is unless you simply present a filmed play where the camera emulates a theater audience.

That's why I've become obsessed recently with the study of such adaptation -- of Shakespeare, Wilde, Austen and others. Things must go pretty far back in the geneology of the idea for meaningful reinvention in order to make a meaningful film.

Here is a special case, made more difficult because the play has changed meaning even as a play from when it was written. The British class system has been reinvented; as with Austen, the film was intended for the same people it pilloried. Also, all the sex has drained out as the subtle tweaks of Wilde have lost their meaning. ('Earnest' meant something like bi-sexual chivalry, and the relationship between the two male leads was ambiguous.)

So, what to do? One unavoidable artifact of film is its focus on the face, and in modern times the convention that peoples' motivations are 'explained.' Add to that the loss of tone of the banter. The theater can accommodate a snappy cadence. Film cannot, but the comic tone of that banter is the spine of the enterprise.

Parker substitutes a comic sound track that annotates every motion. It helps. Helps a lot. He is forced to expand the range of action beyond the original few rooms, and at the same time provide some backstories. So he shuffles and adds. This doesn't impress, but it is not there to do so, merely to qualify the cinematic justification. 

Where I think this misses is in the women. They are all wrong. Dench does her standard bit. I am really angry at her for torpedoing the really intelligently conceived 'Iris,' with her refusal to understand the context of the experiment. So too here: she herself is as dimly obstreperous as the character she plays. Please, no more Dench until the part needs the one thing she can do.

Reese Witherspoon gets the accent right I guess, but is misdirected. She does facial comedy, but this requires linguistic rubato, the kind of thing that Emma Thompson can do. She's lost. 

I really like O'Connor generally -- 'Mansfield Park' was an adventure. But when you compare this to 'Ideal Husband,' (the last Wilde/Parker/Everett outing) you'll see what I mean. That play's language crackled, its pace was carried by the actors, and two of these (Moore and Blancett) were two of the three best actresses in the world of film. They bent to the new cinematic center; they understood where they needed to go and had the guts to go there. They transformed the rhythm of repartee in the play to visually physically rhythm of person.

This play is about sex. Everything else annotates, even (especially!) the class and deception jokes. That's been lost. Can we have it back?

Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

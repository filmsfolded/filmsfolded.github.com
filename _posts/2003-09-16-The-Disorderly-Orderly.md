Spoilers herein.

Many film comedies are oddly insensitive to the comedic talents of the star when the  strength of that star is to be intrinsically ridiculous.

That's because you have to juggle and integrate several things: the funniness of the man  himself and the funniness of the local situations and skits, to the wrapper of the story  that is required for us to accept it as a movie.

Here we have Lewis the unequalled goofball, funny in himself. They engineer numerous  skits, all of which fit the peculiar Lewis type of pratfall performance and a few of which  are still funny. Where this thing seems dated now is in the wrapper story.

The sad thing is that this (and "Nutty Perfesser") is just about the best Jerry Lewis we  have. He deserved better. Can you imagine him in something better integrated like "The  Producers?"

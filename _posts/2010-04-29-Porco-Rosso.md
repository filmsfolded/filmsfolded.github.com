The things this filmmaker drops on the path, charm in their strangeness and that is good enough for me.

I originally thought to write about the role of certain filmmakers in their films: how you can see over a number of films their foibles and fears, their attempts at self-analysis and completion. It is one of those many things about cinema that is interesting to a viewer, but it is not quite good enough material for a comment associated with a film. Even with Fellini we aren't interested in how his films transformed him as a soul, only how they transform us. IMDb needs a way to comment on or even write essays about a filmmaker. 

So instead I will write about something that factors into our story-of-watching as well as the filmmaker's.

Stories carry us forward. They carry us because they entice with the impossibilities of what happens next which could be anything, combined with the conflicting certainty of the equally powerful urge that it will "end well." Any storyteller will eventually tell you about himself and the story he makes for himself. If he lives in cinema, well then he will literally live in cinema, thinking of himself in cinematic terms.

I like Miyazaki. I like the imagination behind the images better than I am drawn to the skill and richness of their execution. You live their lives.

Here we have some powerful fantasies: a redheaded intelligent younger woman that is smitten with him. An older woman, wise in the ways of the world patiently waiting for him to discover the possibilities. Self-loathing over missed opportunities. A love of living in dimension, mastering height in a visual way, seeing everyone before they see you. 

What a guy. The one movie is enough for you to like him. The genre urge pulls.

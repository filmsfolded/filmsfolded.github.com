Spoilers herein.

French films have extra work to do in my case. Most of them are intelligent to be sure,  but the intelligence is of a febrile sort, hotly conceived but a bit ill and trivial. There are only  three French films that I can think of that really have made an impression: 'Marienbad,'  Godard's 'Lear,' and this. 

The first two are lifealtering in an obvious way. This one moves much more subtly. 

The game in film narrative is usually to make things whole, to fill a bag with elements that  are artificially complete, that reference nothing outside the bag. Its a tough trick, as anyone  knows who has written for the screen. Easy to do; hard to do and not seem artificial. (That's  why you have so many current writers deliberately being artificial.)

Melville's approach is wholly different. Instead of building a world by what he shows, he  builds a much larger and more complex one by what he infers but does not show.

He has the skin of the bag, to be sure - here called the red circle. There's quite a lot within  that circle. But every element of the narrative, indeed most actual movements, are triggered  by events or governed by laws outside the circle, beyond what we see. What matters here is  not what is within, but what billiards come zooming in from outer space.

Yes, some of this comes from other films, primarily Hollywood western and gangster films.  That's required because the world of any film is always drawn from those of other films. Its  as if by showing some slight fragment (the former girlfriend listening at the door), he directs  us to recall another bag which we know well through repetition.

It is more important that we never know the cigarette girl - for instance - than anything  else, or what happened to the third cat, or just what how internal affairs investigation was  progressing.

Actually a set of bags, because the power in these references is the ambiguity. This is truly  masterful storytelling, importing complexity by the reference of omission, exactly opposite  of Melville's whaling namesake. The business about 'everyone being guilty' and the coolness  are merely artifacts of the technique rather than the point.

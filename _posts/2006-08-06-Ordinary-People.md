Lots of people liked this. You probably will too.

I didn't. Its because at the end of any movie, I ask myself why it was made. I recently saw "Ladder 49" and found parts of it stimulating visually, but it failed the "why" test. It was made to monetize the perceived heroism of 9-11 firefighters.

This movie is effective. It portrays a woman damaged by a loss who then goes on to damage the survivors. They fight back and perhaps win. Its done well enough that you get engaged and almost certainly cry.

Afterwards you will decide whether you were manipulated to good cause. Were your buttons pushed just to collect your ticket? Was there something that happened that made you better as a result of the petty pain you went through?

In this case, I think the answer is neither. Surely, this wasn't something that will be recorded on the tree rings of my soul. But I do think Redford and the players were honest in what they attempted. The problem is that actors have one set of concerns and that never -- never -- makes for a whole movie.

Actors are engaged to engage us, period. They'll cheat, pose, lie, feign great things. They'll destroy what's real and what's solid if they can get closer to us. They are whores in a way, intending to leave us and go on to the next thing, ideally leaving us happy with the memory of what they brought.

Its us that have to judge how to accept them, what to guard and what to give. I have learned never to trust Redford. A good, honest man, a man who understands acting, someone who needs to be admired for trying to build a life that matters.

But his art? It is soulless, and will leave you worse off, not better. Pack your suitcase, and leave.

I really anticipated this, as I suppose did many. A self-aware film about self-aware films that invented a prevalent notion of women? Some actors who have changed my life? Made by a fellow who blew me out of seat the last time?

It does have a very promising idea. It does have Daniel Day creating a whole human in spite of the script. And if you know Fellini, it has lots of references and a few anti-references to Fellini films (not the flops), and that is mild fun. The camera strains for interesting shots and sometimes succeeds.

Everyone will have their own theory about why this fails. It is easy enough to blame the songs. They are simply tepid. But there was another thing that opened the floor for me when watching this. The thing tries hard to actually be somewhat close to the place Fellini was. 

The magic of Fellini's work is not so much that gave us unique visions that informed whatever you think it was. The magic is that he did so by using women as the abstraction technique -- the world as modeled via dimensions of women. He is by no means the first to try, but he was the first to do so as an explicit technique starring himself as immersed in the process. And so far as I am concerned, he was the first to truly succeed through purely cinematic means. 

All of his womanly qualities are presented visually, not through textually described situation. Costumes matter for him and in a real sense the order was women, image, cinema, self, not self, women, movie as we have here. Fellini's films used "woman" the same way he used light and words. Poses were situations and ordinary situations were dreams and unfinished scenes. The world as seduction. Creating as a matter of seducing seduction.

The casting of the women is pretty disastrous. The key women have already blown their "I- am-an-image" currency so come to us already beyond the control of the filmmaker, even if he understood Fellini. Kate Hudson as seductress? Nicole in the role of powerful bosomdancer? Penelope as helpless?

So. Bad musical. Poor understanding of cinematic womanliness. Some good understanding of the angst of the genius when adrift from his women, but points taken off because that has nothing to do with our filmmakers.

Go back to Greenaway's try at this.

Spoilers herein.

Some films are built around the notion of an acting duel, nothing more. And here we have two of the best at this sort of thing. Both excel at bouncing off of another actor. Here, the plot handily accommodates: Spacey's character is an actor himself who pulls a huge con on Kline. Kline is able to come out on top, but by cheating. We know to expect this because Kline is established early in the film as a cheater.

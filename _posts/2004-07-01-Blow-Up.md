Spoilers herein.

I consider this a fine example of a doubly folded film. The first fold is the much commented  fold between the filmmaker and his chief character. Some rather obvious matters of reality  and the projected image are explored. You can read about them in thousands of places.

The second fold is unintended. Here we have Antonioni making a film about self-indulgent  artists in the sixties with effect ideas. I'm sure at the time that he thought himself above this.  Both he and we thought his art rather profound at the time. Silly us. Look at this now and see  the second fold of the filmmaker into the character.

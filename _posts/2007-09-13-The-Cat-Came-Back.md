If you do simple comedy in the short form, the usual route is to have one comic situation that you elaborate with small jokes. In most cases, it is the small interstitial jokes that are funny, sometimes the things that are afterthoughts.

The context here is a man trying to dispose of an unwanted cat and getting foiled Wiley Coyote-wise. Most of these are less funny than you'd find in roadrunner or Toma and Jerry.

But one scenario has a side joke that is hilarious. Our man who is tortured by a cat is in a boat with the cat in a bag. He ends up on the lakebottom holding an anchor with the cat safely topside. The big joke is that around him on this lakebottom are dozens of similar bags, presumably with drowned cats.

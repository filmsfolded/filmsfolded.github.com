Since the beginning of film, the art form has been captive of the phenomenon of celebrity. So we often have the situation of characters in the play which are dissonant from the setting, the rest of the film. In addition to being integrated into the film story as characters, they are simultaneously integrated into a 'real life' drama where they serve as archetypes, as larger characters in the greater play of life.

The celebrity of the archetypes is largely manufactured, and in any case driven by dark forces in the unconscious, which makes them less real. But the magic of film is that the illusion of reality in placing the viewer at the scene is independent of this and extremely powerful.

Thus, the normal situation in film is that the characters are less 'real' than the overall fabric of the film and most of its parts -- when Charlton Heston plays a minor role in Hamlet, we see the character's role (a poor actor), and the real person (also a poor actor), plus all sorts of extra semiotic dimensions (gun thug, cartoon Moses ...). In that particular case, the director deliberately played on the illusion that the character was less real than the play, which itself wells realism.

The mix of animation and 'real' photography offers exaggerations on this reality. Roger Rabbit and the Mask were interesting not because they were even good entertainment, but because they captivated by playing on this dissonance.

Now we have another dinosaur movie with no intrinsic value. The animals in this film are impressive in our day as Spielberg's were in their era, and even his shark before that. Next year, new magic will eclipse these renderings as well. But what we have here is a positively mundane film that still fascinates. And the reason is this dissonance again.

For those who don't know, the characters are modern 3-d cartoons, made on a computer. But they are placed (mostly) in films of real scenes, taken from around the world: a first in terms of a whole film (and lack of real creatures as a reference). And in a homeopathic increase, the more real the creatures look, the greater the dissonance between foreground and background. Utterly fascinating.

A sad point on viewing. Most kiddie movies should be seen in a theater of kids since they carry the visceral flow of the petty drama and surround you with juvenile commitment. Don't bother here. There is no connection with kids' fantasies.

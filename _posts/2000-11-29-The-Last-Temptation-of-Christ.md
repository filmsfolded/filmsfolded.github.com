Seeing a movie in context, and understanding that context is a wonderful thing. When I first saw this, it was new, and universally condemned by fundamentalists. I saw it in Pat Robertson's back yard with screaming zealots outside. 

At the time it seemed adventuresome: Paul as a knowing liar. Now that I like! ('my Jesus is more powerful')

Now, with some distance, it is obvious how trapped Scorcese was in bible-school images. It seems there's not much an artist can do to escape the purile. There always has to be enough of the conventional to allow us viewers to carry along. What courage it took to play with images considered sacred. However, that so many favorable IMDb comments are from 'christians,' is a testament to his ultimate failure.

But this is still a good experience. Scorcese knows how to create a visual mood, knows how to create memorable images. Any of his films have interest, and this is the period when he was still taking risks, still energetic.

Gabriel's score still stands, and I suppose that is because he uses fewer western themes than Scorcese/Schrader. In fact, all of the characters are too western in carriage, speech, appearance.

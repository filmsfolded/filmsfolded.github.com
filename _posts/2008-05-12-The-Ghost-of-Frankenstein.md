I went on a binge, watching all four of the first Universal Frankenstein movies. I know that many believe "Metropolis" to be the first mad scientist movie. But that wasn't about science or scientists, but about repressive society. The "science" there was actually technology and had as much to do with things as the devices in "1984." 

This, this, I think is the first movie series where the whole point was that science was inerrently evil in its tendencies. Its different than a Faust story, where powers were conveyed for selfish ends; here the ends are discovery. Its no mistake that there's the heavy hand of religion in the village context that surrounds the man and his work.

So when I watch these, I pay attention to two things. One is how science is portrayed. Its radically different in all four. And the second is how the cinematic grammar is used to present that notion. Its a sort of hobby of mine to compare sequels and remakes.

In this fourth one, we go through yet another change in how science is handled. Once again it shifts from the cosmic to the ordinarily human. Its about brains doing science and science on brains. We are reminded that the original scientist was not misguided, it was just his stupid assistant who made the mistake of using a "criminal" brain. Otherwise, all would be well. The doctor this time is a brain healer, and he has guess what? A dumb assistant who makes a critical mistake in substituting brains.

The foreboding oboe of the last film gives way to a plaintive bassoon. The little boy of the last to a little girl. I think the shift in gender subtly supports this shift in science to human again. 

The ghost is not the ghost of the monster, who we learned last time has this cosmic invulnerability. It is the ghost of the original science visited upon his son to advise against killing the creature, merely fixing the prior brain error.

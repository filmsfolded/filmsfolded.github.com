Spoilers herein.

Films are seldom about reality. The better ones have asserted distance from reality.

But it is a tricky game, and depends on finding a rare niche. This same team went from here to 'Hudson Hawk,' which hit a niche for me. This doesn't. 'Ginger Snaps' did.

I suppose part of the charm was the reputation Winona already had as a weirdo. Ah, those were the days: Johnny and Winona, Brad and Juliette, Sean and Madonna. An era that is long over. Anyone who says diff is Â‘sawed.

Fake pretension is so over. It's so unclever.

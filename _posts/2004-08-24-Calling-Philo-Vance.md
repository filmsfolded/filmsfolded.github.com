Spoilers herein.

There are two kinds of films: those that simply talk to you, and those that have an engaging  conversation of some type. There are an amazing number and variety of the second type,  with the prototype being the detective story. In its pure form it is an intimate wrestling  match for control over what happens next in your imagination.

This is interesting because it is something in between. The detective story is very clever in  the situation it presents. But it is not given as a game, instead all we can do and watch as the  story surprises us with its various confabulations. 

Its titillating being on the edge.

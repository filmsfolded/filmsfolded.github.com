Spoilers herein.

By now, you already know that this is inferior to the original. As well, you've heard from we appreciators of the original that the mystery of the first is 'explained' in the remake and that the explanations are stupid.

The problem is that once again a film about hacking and math is made by goofy artistic types who have some notions based on old movies but no concept of the amazing depths of the real world. But this movie was fun in two ways: keeping up with the errors and at the same time thinking about how this could have been done right.

The original had a collection of cubes that moved against each other mechanically by sliding. This is NOT the Rubik's cube motion suggested by others here, which is a rotation (to match surfaces on the cube). Some cubes had special properties associated with and denoted by numbers. The remake has a muddle of transformations, all incorrect mathematically and even inconsistent with each other. The big 'clue' is a notation of time that is even profoundly mistaken, sometimes as a point in time, sometimes as a duration; sometimes it is denoted in base ten, sometimes in octal, sometimes in minutes and seconds.

I have some experience with these matters, so let's think about how we would make such a film.

First off, it would be for a black (that is: unacknowledged) agency, not a 'weapons firm.' It might torture (unlikely) or test humans but never, ever those involved in its creation. It would have lots of internal controversy in the team between engineers and scientists which would be readily apparent from how it is built and what tradeoffs were made. The technical features wouldn't look cool, and few elements (like doors) would be user friendly.

It would surely not be based on a multidimensional cube. Cubes make sense in three dimensions, but nowhere else. Almost certainly we would use Shoen surfaces which are visually way cool. They are curved weaves of cells that divide the world in half: the 'outside' space is identical to the 'inside.' The three D expression is like sculpted soap bubbles, visually hypnotic. Transitioning from one side to another would signal/cause a shift.

The underlying theory would be geometric rather than probabilistic, which means no Nobel laureate is going to be remotely involved. Some odd thinkers from across the globe would be recruited, and not for nationalistic reasons which means that all sorts of extra and secondary things will be implemented. The location would not be North America or Europe for legal reasons. One visionary programmer will be the implementor, heading a small interdisciplinary team including a logical topologist, cognitive group theorist, situation theory linguist, an Islamic morphologist, 2 category evolutionists (molecular and anthropology) and three warring semioticians.

Coding will be in a language derived from Haskell and supported by an open source project masquerading as something else. One notation will be musical, possibly sexual. One user interface will be collaborative string figures (Cat's cradle). The support team would be rather large but primarily concerned with keeping the primary players happy, healthy and motivated; presumably, this would include various means for them to play with their creation. The logic will be 'soft,' and no relevant notation will look like recognizable equations. 'Movements' will use all three symmetry operations (translation, rotation, reflection) rather than the simple translation of the first films. Symmetry transforms will be essential, as well as dimensional ones. The Lattice will have a semantic mapping to individual cognitive history. (At least 'The Matrix' got this right more or less.) Primary visualization would be through hyperstereograms.

Such a film might look a lot like 'Prospero's Books,' meets 'Gummo' with shifts between the action 'in' the cube and 'of' the cube. It would all be about folding and would necessarily bring into question the folding of film and audience. It would be visually rich, terrifying and change lives. For some, it would create a cinematic religion but surely it would affect how we think about ourselves and governments.

On the performance side, since the budget (of the film) will be constrained, it won't use the three successful actresses (Cate, Kate and Julianne) who understand this sort of thing. Instead we'd use Sarah Polley, Clare DuVall and Alicia Witt on the female side. The male side would matter less, but PS Hoffman would be an asset.

I urge you to see this. You will enjoy it for its tight writing within each ministory; but there are greater joys in the construction as a whole. The characters are united spatially -- they all end up on a bus that has an event. But they are interwoven in a deeper way, as the eye skips from one story to the other. Rather than being separate and requiring work to keep them straight, each event in each story adds to a tone of the movie as a whole. It surrounds a whole people and provides a more universal insight into humanity than any single story could.

It is not profound; the writer knows not to be overly ambitious. It is about as perfect as screen writing gets, and in 1933! This is where "Short Cuts" comes from.

One story satisfies my notion of folding: a young couple is in love. He is a "professor," she a showgirl. The tension between them has to do with his problems in accepting her appeal being exposed as part of what is called here "the business," meaning the business of theater. London in that era was the world center for the theater and between the wars also the center of thinking about what this new medium of film would bring in terms of constraints and opportunities. The central issues are reflected in this little story -- which ends happily for the couple, and us.

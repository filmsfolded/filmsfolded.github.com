As with many of my films, I came to this because of a reader's recommendation. She said that it contained an Orrery, a cinematic interest of mine. 

Well, it doesn't. There's a sort of clockwork cog effect at the end that triggers the machine that destroys the cursed church. I never understood just why, or why all the other stuff happened. Sure there was a slaughter, and magic and a curse. Well, anyway, the idea is that the filmmaker has an excuse for episodes of death, sex and sexanddeath. One or two of these are impressive and struck me. I wonder if those can from Argento.

Those two minutes are scant reward for this hackery, except for one thing.

Asia Argento Is something of a token today. She's not a particularly good actress, but she is a rather profound presence. Some of that is sheer sexual openness (with an emblazoned groin). But I think a large part of it is that she understands film and what it means to situate self in a frame and the viewer's mind. Her dad is something of an intuitive in this way, even though otherwise he is sorta dumb.

Here she is! At 11 or 12, she already has this awareness. Here's proof that sex has little to do with it at least in this case. That's only added later as an additional tool to what she already had, possibly since age four when these things are set. Her pubic tattoo? Incidental. Her frequent nudity? A knowing distraction.

If you wonder about these things, and who doesn't, then you will find this little movie haunting -- and not in the way advertised.

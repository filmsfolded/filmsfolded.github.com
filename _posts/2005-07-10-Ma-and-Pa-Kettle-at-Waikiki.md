I wonder why there is such a persistent tradition in movies to depict low class folks comically.

Its usually done with apparent sympathy to the honest or simple values of our rubes, and the only people treated harshly are the rich (and bankers). "Beverly Hillbillies" was the extreme, I guess.

But the root of the thing is a sort of white minstrel mentality. While we chuckle over the dumbness (and in this case laziness) of these trailer park dummies (who seem to do nothing but rut and make more), isn't the point that we are superior?

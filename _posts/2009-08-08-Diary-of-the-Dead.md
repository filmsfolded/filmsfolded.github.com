What do you do if you invent a genre and cannot escape it? Well, I guess you try on those devices that can be applied to any genre without refitting the basic thing. In this case, it is the Blair Witch thing, where the movie is turned into a movie within the movie, recorded as a documentary.

It allows you to be a little more severe than usual. And where Romero likes to apply relatively insipid social commentary on his films, here he can do it overtly. We have a "film professor" who can prattle on.

Some genres can thrive, evolving, referring to themselves in ever richer layers. This zombie thing is just about worn out, I think, because its inventor is so brain dead.

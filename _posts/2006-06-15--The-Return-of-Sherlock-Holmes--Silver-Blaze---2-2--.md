The Granada Holmes episodes are hit and miss. This is a hit.

For this to work, you have to have a backbone that's strong. In this case, it is because Holmes is depicted here as an actual detective, someone who figures things out. No tricking, no undercover work, just thinking.

On that, you hope the adapter hangs appropriate cinematic storytelling. This isn't great, but compared to other episodes is refreshing.

This is the famous episode where an important clue is that the dog didn't bark.

This is the series where Holmes is depicted as the detective that does bark. It works, after a fashion.

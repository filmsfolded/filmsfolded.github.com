Spoilers herein.

Irish Celtics have a pooka tradition, an understanding of which greatly enhances this story.

The pooka only appears in stories, and then as a sort of expandable dramatic troupe. The pooka always appears in the story as a character, with all the other characters in the story but one played by sub-pookas, or other views of the kingpooka. The one non-pooka character is placed in a world between reality and magic, the confusion between which is the point of the story.

The normal character here is Nurse Kelly -- note the Irish name.

Much more fun to see every character but her as part of a pookatroupe.

Nurse Kelly is played by Peggy Dow, one of the most remarkable actresses I've encountered. Possibly the most flat out beautiful woman in a day when that was what mattered most. From Louisiana, educated at Northwestern, she arrived in Hollywood and immediately was put on the starlet track. By one year she was on the cover of Life magazine. By the second year, she had been in nine movies. 

Then she met her prince (heir to an oil fortune) and left Hollywood. She left abruptly and her place in the next film was haphazardly filled by another beauty, another character named Kelly, Grace Kelly. This first film allowed her to pick up Dow's destiny in a sense.

So. In addition to having nearly all the characters in the film be pooka for a character named Kelly, that character then transformed into an actress named Kelly for whom all Hollywood was pooka. It would take Grace five years to find and marry her prince. Interesting, this. Makes you wonder where you stand yourself, doesn't it?

To appreciate this film you have to:

-- Have Geena's role as Louise firmly planted in your mind, which is the case for moderately serious moviewatchers

-- Appreciate the valentine that this is from her husband -- who would go even further later

-- Live in a post-feminist mind that appreciates a woman in a man's role but secretly relishes when she is sexy, and rationalize it because she has a high IQ

-- Know that this woman did many of her own stunts at nearly 40

-- Be aware that pirating was all about sex not gold

-- Spent a fair amount of your youthful imagination with 'Treasure Island' inspired fantasies.

If so, you don't care that this movie is as bad as, say the "Jurassic Park" stuff, and for much the same reason. You just don't care.

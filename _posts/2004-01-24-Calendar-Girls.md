Spoilers herein.

Helen Mirren is an odd duck as an actress, someone like Shirley McLean who projects  energetic frankness first and then shoehorns her character in somehow. But then she's  been in Greenaway's most commercial film, and Weir's best, Altman's most celebrated,  even (in a minor role) the best film of 2001 (by Penn) and more than a few respectable  Shakespeare productions.

Here she and comrades earn their keep by creating a few characters that are intended to  charm through some charming vignettes. These are loosely tossed together with no  sense or continuity, but then they are not meant to have any - this is very simply an  aged coquettish smile to which we should smile back.

If you are satisfied by this type of thing, I recommend 'Strangers in Good Company,' by  far more honest and no less thin.

I am intrigued by a certain class of movie which I call 'folded;' these are films about films  or books (here, something in between, a set of photographs sold in bookstores), and  acting about acting. If the primary fold is not specifically about film, there usually is a  side plot about movies or Hollywood. 

Check, check, check. There is even a scriptDirector template for this form. What's  particularly interesting is the comment on the fold: the 'pictures' need an artist, and one  is found. It is really clear that the success of the pictures is due entirely to him. Once out  in the world, the artist - and art - are lost. Precisely as it is with the picture show that  is this movie.

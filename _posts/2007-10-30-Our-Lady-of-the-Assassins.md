In a way, I've been looking for a better "Breathless," for years. 

The original, the template, struck me as more of an essay on the emptiness of French film than anything else. It did create a narrative tone, but that tone required the absence of narrative structure. The story was that there was no story. It seemed possible for there to be something a bit more complex than a selfaware void and reference to American gangster films.

We have that here. Its the same form: life has somehow locally had the plug pulled on purpose. A writer appears back home after a successful life at creating narrative and now discovers its all used up. He is prepared to die. The movie consists of several adventures with death, several dream-hallucinations that present a narrative of death (with a character that appears in "real" life and announces death), and a number of encounters with story in music and religion. 

Any of the encounters with death might be successful and the rest of the movie that during-death vision. Or any of it could be the author's writing of what happened before prompted by what happened before. Or it could all be post-death, which is to say post- writing. It still is all suspense and on the surface no movement, but the viewer moves as the narrative possibilities increase.

Oh. He's gay and there's some folding of his character with a dead woman saint contained in the crypt of a certain church. So the "lady" is himself. 

In this world of coke, murder and perversion, no one smokes.

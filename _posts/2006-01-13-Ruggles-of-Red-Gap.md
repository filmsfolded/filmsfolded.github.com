What's great about having a hundred years worth of movies is the ability to see how people have solved various cinematic problems. It isn't that we have exhausted the limits of the thing -- in fact I think we are just getting started.

But the simple things, I mean. And in particular the simple comedic things.

I'd like to talk you into seeing this for comedy by the rolling, moving, shifting eye. Charles Laughton is a valet who gets involved in a traditional British comedy of class. You know, the business about shifting levels. Absolutely mundane in its basic shape and I've seen other versions that are thoroughly mundane.

But here, all the comedy depends on Laughton. And all his technique (except for some subtle hand flappings with his arms aside) is in his eyes. He rolls them. he sifts them, opens wide, sometimes stares. He's otherwise the staid servant.

It is a lesson in comedic acting. Pure, almost as if it were designed as an example. And everything that surrounds it is bland, as if to highlight the example.

There's something about eyes and cinema. Even in a simple comedy, we subconsciously know we are watching. Sometimes we choose to watch askance ourselves. In a strange way, this sometimes staid observer is our standin. And when he rolled his eyes, I felt mine pulled a bit.

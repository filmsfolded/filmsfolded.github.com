Spoilers herein.

In my book, there are three great filmmakers, people who invented film: Welles, Kurosawka and Eisenstein. All concern themselves with the architecture of image and the images of architecture. But only the first two spent time with Shakespeare. This is Eisenstein's substitute.

The bridge with silent films is apparent. Silent films required an open, exaggerated manner of acting. My own opinion is that with the introduction of sound, we took a huge step backward in the development of a visual grammar. That's because sound demanded words; acting became more text-based until now where we have two types of pictures: the 'MTV' types uses rhythm and simple images; the 'illustrated text' kind dominates and depends on the text for richness.

Both rely on Eisenstein's innovations. The MTV style derives directly from 'October.' The illustration of text is influenced by his other work, most strongly this Ivan epic.

So viewer, bypass the totalitarian text and watch how architecture is used. Though the camera would be static until de Palma freed it, there is still lots of innovative relationship between the camera and the buildings; lots of abstract lighting; lots of interaction of characters with their space (including those wonderful short doorways). For example, look at the scene where Ivan has the bible placed over his face -- and a following scene where the dueling glares of the two women (aunt/wife) take its place.

I claim Eisenstein's influence is profound precisely because it is not obvious. As with Hitchcock, Greenaway and Kubrick, we have taken many of his mannerisms and made them part of the 'real' world we expect to see in film. Just as all space ship explosions now must look like Lucas' to seem 'real,' so must the shift from group shots to individual closeups (with different lighting!) follow Eisenstein's conventions. So must the flight of the camera denote the appearance and flight of ideas as we 'see' them. Check out how we see the evil aunt concoct and opportunistically conduct the poisoning.

What's so amazing to my mind is the persistence of these conventions. We now think, even dream this way. For his whole filmmaking life, he was under the oppressive thumb of Stalinism. Now, that is long dead and Eisenstein's vision defines truth. Imperialism of the eye.

And check out the inversion of self-reference: all politics is theater. What we have here is theater of that theater. Interesting how we are shown how thinly manipulative it is, and then THE VERY SAME manipulations are used on us. Clever.

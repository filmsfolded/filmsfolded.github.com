Spoilers herein.

Films are like no other element of life. For the people who do them, they are a living. But it is art as well. And because they persist, and because we seek them out for enjoyment, they are the legacy of the artists as well. Nothing else is quite like this, at least so far as the actors are concerned.

Now here we have Jackie Gleason. By this time, his 'Honeymooner' work was done but had not experienced the revival and popular appreciation it now has. So the man needed money and landed here. And what a sad result.

All of the humor in this project is the kind that makes fun of types of people. It both strengthens stereotypes and meanly pokes fun at them. One can see all the fears of the time: sex, race, Nixonian law, 'technology.' This is one for students of society only.

You know what? This is pretty incompetent in a few ways, but the incompetence works for it.

This is a murder mystery of the old school. You are introduced to characters. Murders are being committed. Clues are placed around. Many suspects and many motives are given.

There is a chatroom angle, but that does not matter. There is a horror genre angle, but that does not matter either.

What matters is that you really are allowed to be the detective. There are none of the detective genre devices that you expect to find. The situation is very chaotic, more nonsensical than the conventions allow. That's what makes it work. Yes, you are a bit surprised at the end. But they play fair, and in the denouement, you have the film flashbacks to attest that the solution was under your nose.

The production values are pretty bad. And the lines are profoundly juvenile. But the mystery itself: cool stuff.

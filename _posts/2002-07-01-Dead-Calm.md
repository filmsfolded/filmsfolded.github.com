Spoilers herein.

The setup is terrific. The photography is apt, at least the exteriors. The actors are earnest and Nichole has the requisite lovely vulnerability. The director shows in places that he knows how to shape tension.

So what's wrong? The screenplay. There's all sorts of extra bumph at the beginning as if to say: 'we're going to tell you every detail about the motivation of the characters.' But -- and this is a big but -- nothing we have learned informs the real story. A bigger but: we learn nothing about the Zane character. That's okay, but why shift storytelling philosophies? And that is not the only shift: the two threats (him sinking with bodies and her kidnapped and raped) are handled differently as if there were different writers and directors involved. And then tacked on is some plot device mailed in from Hollywood.

I tracked this down because of Nichole and her recent performances. They impressed. This does not.

I wonder what the master Welles was doing with this material? Will we ever see it? I imagine Welles made much of the interloper's story: is it true? Which parts are not and how will it affect what happens next? We have the viewer clearly in two bodies: we know twice as much as either character and from a certain point on as much as the interloper. 

Only we can put the two together to make sense, to worry. In this version, neither side's story informs the other at all except that we discover the dismembered women. But we knew he was loopy from the first moment.

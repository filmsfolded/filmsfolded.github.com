Sommers earned the right to be taken seriously in my book with Van Helsing. It touched a lot of my buttons; respectful inheritance from other movies while playing with genre, an insertion of a likely absinthe vision, an appropriate leverage of the redhead and most important what seemed to me to be a new way of managing space.

The mummy things were in a way a fun extension of that related genre but were otherwise uninteresting except for one thing: the sand. I could be wrong, but I think that the first Sommers Mummy movie invented the cinematic device of malevolent texture. It has already become a standard effect, especially in the "eating dust" weapon area.

These sorts of things are difficult to track. It should be easy because they are generally not gracefully evolved. They appear out of the blue and then simply become part of the vocabulary. So they should be easy to recognize, right? I find them very hard to tease out, because for them to be successful, they have to make so much visual sense that it seems to be the way it has always been. More, it seems as if that is the way the world really is.

An example is the way the death star explodes in the first Star Wars. The dynamics is physically incorrect. It is, in fact, so far from the way it might be that you subconsciously and involuntary slide into a world where you can deny reality. I actually do believe that repeated cinematic experiences of this kind reinforce the recent new trend in political discourse where reality can be blithely ignored. Its because when you now see a space explosion, it will surely look like that first, fiery, noisy death star event. It has to, because it was first. Some nameless artist established this reality. For all I know, trillions of visual reasoning linkages have already been led by the way we "see" that death.

The textures of Sommers are probably more influential, if such a thing is possible. That visual notion has spread fast. I see it everywhere and see how it has influenced even discourse in the real sciences. (I'm not kidding here.)

In this project we have that taken further in two ways. Set aside that the movie itself is dull. Almost anything else would be a more rewarding experience. And set aside that the characters are universally trailer park bimbos. 

It moves the texture notion to the idea of texture in the action itself. The sort of thing we are seeing in Transformers (another Hasbro production) is doing something like this from another, coarser-grained visual tradition. But here, look closely, all the effects and compositions are based on this notion of tiny elements in concerted motion. This matters, folks, because whether we like it or not, we hungrily adopt these compositions in the way we reason.

Just as interesting is something I have personal insight into. When you do CGI and want it to matter, you have to place humans in the thing. For millions of years we have evolved the notion of human to mean essentially faces and sex. Sex has its own dynamics. 

We haven't mastered faces yet. We can do shape okay, and the kinematics. We are close to emotion. Where we are deficient is in skin texture. That's right folks, skin texture is our most highly evolved visual sense. It has powerful conveyance. We might write a comment about how facial textures are suppressed in the service of sex, this dynamic being why women's makeup exists. But here we are about something more technical.

This film is the first that is serious about facial textures in the CGI effects. There is a company, Aguru Images, that has developed cool technology for this. An early version was used on Benjamin Button, but the full up stuff here. This is very essential and powerful stuff. The fact that Sommers and team have used it, and placed it in the context of textured agency in effects and composition is profound stuff. 

As with Transformers, see this because it it part of something that is changing the basic stuff of our imagination, in spite of the profoundly dumb characters and story. 

It makes me wonder. Why are Hasbro productions so advanced in this way and Marvel productions so retarded?

Spoilers herein.

Recent discovery: dino's nostrils are low on their faces, not high as shown here. That allows them greater sense of smell and more 'nasal' vocalizations. A real shame that so much money was spent and they still got it wrong.

Cat's eye comments follow:

First of the series from the perspective of the dino. Follows the scifi tradition of robots that are able to both evolve and replicate more intelligent editions to battle humans. In this case, the robots have evolved a superkiller to protect the island, knowing that humans will return soon. They can talk of course. But the fliers disagree and decide on a run and proliferate strategy.

Standing orders are to kill the men and save the women and children for experiments, and always to defer the killing to the big guys if possible. But one of the intruders steals some eggs, the greatest taboo. Makes it necessary for the spino to kill a few small dinos just to keep order, but the rebellion grows.

The fliers do get involved in an undisciplined way, and they are exiled to another island. The smaller raptors who are keepers of the eggs do confront the intruders and get the eggs back. Wheels turn and the lack of discipline (plus some gasoline) allow the bad guys to barely escape. Then the good guys have them, then the bad guys show up with all their machines of destruction.

We are led to believe that the dino robot population kill the spinos and devise a new, more powerful protection for the next episode: combination dino/war machines.

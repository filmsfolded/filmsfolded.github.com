Spoilers herein.

Once again we have an actor in charge -- this time it is Sandra Bullock who commissioned a script and produced herself. When writers are in charge, we have scripts about writing, like 'Wonder Boys or 'Finding Forrester.' When actors are in charge, the plot device is usually about acting. That's why so many Shakespeare plays have people in disguises.

If you are a film actor in Hollywood, you have a hard choice to make. For someone like Bullock, you can either become a personality or an actor, a real actor. Kate Winslet has chosen to be a real actor. Sandra wishes she could be, but we won't give her a chance. It has little to do with talent, its just a matter of whether the personality is marketable. If it is, we force these folks into a box. So she (and Roberts and Ryan, and so so many other women) are mere personalities.

As an aside: I really admire Brad Pitt who is in this for the long run, and who seeks out adventuresome, risk-taking roles just because the draw to be a relatively worthless personality (like say Harrison Ford) is so great. And he needs to work hard to avoid it.

What we like about Bullock is what we think she is 'really' like, perky and fun, so we refuse to see her in dramatic roles. The good side is that you make oodles of money as a personality. The bad side is you are reduced to a barking seal, for instance in Julia's case forever working that smile. These people hate their box (unless they are really, really dumb, but we won't mention names). And the game is risky because the big movies that depend on these 'openers' have to be different in some way. So the problem is how to have a familiar personality in a slightly different vehicle.

You can see just how the wheels turned for this film as Bullock tried to get ahead. This time instead of Sandra's character being a pretty airhead, we'll have her play a character pretending to be one! That way, we can make fun of the box, people will come, and we can show the actual process of acting. Along the way of making fun of the box, we can poke fun at the viewers, who here literally gather around a screen and gawk.

To drive the inside joke home, get Candice Bergen to play the conservative Texan villain who is behind the airhead enterprise. (Her goal is to make the winner a literal airhead.) This is the modern Jane Fonda liberal who took on Dan Quale when he had real influence, and won! This is the girl who, and whose dad, considered her to be sibling to Charlie, a true performing airhead personality. No one in the business would fail to get this joke.

Add in a Frick and Frack: Caine who is a very fine non-personality actor who 'tutors' our performer, and Shatner who is making a career poking fun at his own salable personality, which happens to be as a fatuous dope. Okay, those are the key pieces. All else is plot machinery to support these roles, plus a few elements of humor and charm from the stock library.

Its much more interesting watching what the movie is really about than watching the movie itself. At least in this case.

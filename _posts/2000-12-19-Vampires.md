Even the stupidest film sometimes rewards. And this film is stupid - like dozens of its contemporaries, it casts evil against an amoral crusader, with the Church as secondary evil. Here we have a Baldwin, acting Baldwin-y (which means acting from his chest), and stock vampires. I suppose the excuse to make this is the innovation of killing them in a slightly different way than is rote.

But the reward here is James Woods. I think he is one of our best technical film actors. By technical, I mean he works not on the character, but on the dramatic effect of the scene. He's a scene-man. One of the most powerful scenes (seared into my memory) was about thirty seconds in the otherwise forgettable 'True Crime.' Clint Eastwood and he have an exchange about one of their wives which ranks in my top film moments.

Oops, a minor spoiler follows, though you should be able to see it from across the continent.

So here is Woods in a really unartful enterprise, playing a role that seems to allow no room for acting. And his comrades wouldn't know how to cocreate a technical reading anyway. But he's still damned good! It is like fine rock guitar playing: the holes are where the emotion is. Woods does what the director wants during the 'important' moments, like saying goodby to his infected partner, like confronting the cardinal. All according to the specified level of mundaneness. But in the holes, where he is just walking, or grabbing an implement, you can see a good actor. Even this small leavening excites.

And such is noted in the only clever dialog. There's a juvenile running joke about getting an erection when killing vampires. (This I suppose balances the mutual orgasm of the master vampire and hooker victim when he is busied with her genitals.) But that joke is in the form: 'did you get some wood?'

Well, I got some Woods.

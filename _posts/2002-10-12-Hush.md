Spoilers herein.

Ignore this dreadful script. Ignore Gwyneth in what must be the most unsure character of hers we have seen. And focus instead on what Jessica does. Here was a woman who jumped into acting without a clue and got bumped hard. So she studied what it was all about and transformed herself.

It may be too much to ask a casual viewer to be impressed with acting styles, or is it? Lange knows the hard kind of acting, the internal kind where you know who you are and let it come out in subtle ways. Its not showy like the Deniro and such. But in the right vehicle it can be so much more effective. 

More, very few internal actors know how to collaborate with other actors in such a way that they are not playing. Paltrow doesn't have a clue about this, but Holbrook does. Watch the little scene where she wheedles the sex of the baby out of him. Watch what she does here as the quiet harridan and then see her in 'Titus' where she plays an overt harridan with much the same color.

Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

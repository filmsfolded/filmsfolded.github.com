Spoilers herein.

This minor drama becomes a powerful because of one element, the score (and the filmmakers understanding of its importance).

The score is based on one device: two layers of sound. One is rythmic and athletic. The other emotes soaring asperation. One reason film is such an important art is that it is so forgiving. Many elements of a film can be mediocre or even broken if some other element is strong.

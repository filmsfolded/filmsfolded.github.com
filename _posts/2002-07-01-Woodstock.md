Spoilers herein.

This was never a concert, but a defining moment in the struggle for the future of the nation. It was never about music, but about politics as religion, about the massive change of defining what it meant to be alive.

You had to be immersed in the times to get a feel for how true this is. After the war (WWII), the US coasted on self-reinforcing images, images that had been created as a defense during that war. These images were fed by movies but the role was being taken over by popular music.

Meanwhile, as as popular phenomenon, 'folk' music was the stuff of the self-aware. Dylan, who controlled more of the nation's soul than anyone else living, completely shifted that from Folk to Rock at Newport. From that moment on, rock was the medium in which we invested ourselves to create new images to replace those of film. Onto this moving train jumped the Beatles and completely took control. These men changed the relationship of listener to artist: even masquerading as another band in their most influential album.

But by the time of Woodstock, we the youth were adrift. Creating a vocabulary of images as aggressive and intellectual as we expected from early progress turned out to be impossible to sustain by individuals. Enter the 'Music Industry' and supporting cultural niches.

Woodstock was a spontaneous happening, but it happened for a very clear reason: we were yearning for a coherent mythology. Many of us went because we really expected to see both Dylan and The Beatles. Unbeknownst to us, The Beatles were already dead because of the same conflict we see in this film. The Beatles knew they led the future of the world, but disagreed bitterly on the core of that leadership: John pushed for drugged politics; Paul for Kabbalistic, surreal cosmology; George for kundalini; and simple Ringo for simple country music (then still called country and western).

And we see exactly the same battle here in this film: a battle for influence over the structure of our minds. Still kicking were the folkies: dear Joan, Arlo and Richie. Against that: ironic rock (the Who, the Airplane); modern blues (Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, Janis); free jazz meditations (Jimi); pure goof (Sha Na Na); lush pop (CS &amp; N); and popular country (Sebastian and 'Country' Joe). Fit the rest in yourselves, all tussling for mass listenership, working to be the one that caught fire. In the background were various purveyors of watered down religious and political notions. Drugs were there, but they really had little to do with it, only being an excuse for discontinuity.

Now the moment is gone. The hoped-for reinvention never really happened. What emerged were two cultures: one that followed a lobotomized popular music derived from country and one that pretended to be extreme based on various types of staged excess.

Nixon won.

In the final indignity, after the music disemboweled itself, the whole event is turned into a set of what? _Film Icons_. Many more millions of people see this film than ever were there, or for that matter participated in the east coast freak movement (east coast: intellectual 'freaks' -- west coast: dropped out 'hippies'). Those millions are massaged and reinforced by the visuals. The music probably won't mean anything by itself unless you were a part of it. It can't, the images wash the music out. In fact, today the video is what sells the song.

But even within the film world are similar battles for how images are registered in our collective imaginations. Scorsese (who is responsible for the visual and narrative philosophy of this project) represents film images built around characters. It is a sad thing that he got this project rather than someone who understood the music. There are other cinematic philosophies, more powerful, less self-limiting. (Look at how Demme understands the Heads in "Stop Making.") I advise you to look elsewhere for both your understanding of this period and the manner in which you build your imagination.

I don't suppose there is any sort of movie project that is as extensively engineered as these animated things. In part its because you can do things you cannot in "real" movies. But it is also because when they hit, you make more because you don't have A-list actors taking their cut.

The experiment this time has to do with making the camera active. You can do that in three-d animation more easily than in any other technique because once you model the scene you can decided to place and move the camera in any way. Its not quite as easy because backgrounds are modeled differently.

The motion capture technique used here is especially handy for these sorts of experiments because you have real actors creating the movements, so you don't have to decide ahead of time what looks good. You can "shoot" the scene and then discover what looks good afterward.

Its Hitchcock that invented the notion of a curious camera and Altman that advanced that to the notion of arriving in a perspective just enough late to give the impression that you are discovering it. Kar Wai Wong now plays with the rhythms of anticipated and delayed viewing.

Its exciting stuff. And its why this movie was made. And its what you might go to see it for -- the story is ordinary, though once again our girl is redheaded. That's another engineered thing.

Look here at how active the camera is, especially at the beginning. It almost never does something that a "real" camera cannot, but it moves in a way that is practically impossible for a real camera, even to today. In fact it seems that the camera is deliberately moved in ways we aren't used to seeing. And that's exciting, folks.

So much the better that the story involves a human incarnated into a space. This way, you get to see and participate in two incarnated spaces warring, the "house" - woman and the movie - us.

I haven't had this much visual fun since the last big experiment of this kind: "Nemo."

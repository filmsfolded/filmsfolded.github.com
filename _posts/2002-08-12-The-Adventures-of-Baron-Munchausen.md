Spoilers herein.

You already know about the lushness, the imagination and the troubles with budget and studio. You either admire Gilliam's energy or worry over a system that distorts such energy.

I find this film a slightly interesting disaster. Only with 'Fear and Loathing' has Gilliam found a successful way to present his hallucinatory world, because there it is explicitly hallucinagenic.

I make a study of self-referential films, especially those that tell a story about telling a story and where the two stories merge. This is a special and important art form. I celebrate when it is done successfully and grieve when it is not. What's missing here is a coherent notion of how this alternative world works. It doesn't have to be logical or comfortable of course, but it has to readable enough that we have the skills to observe.

Gilliam is sophisticated enough to have laid the groundwork for immense nesting of the dreams: it is a play, a fiction by the authorities, an imagining by the man in the moon when he is not rutting, an arranged tactic by Venus to arouse the world for just such rutting, an opera by the Sultan, or -- the best -- the fantasy of young Sally who even here shows promise as an apprentice actor both in character and 'reality.' Along the way, he juggles the forms: is it Tarkovsky? Grimm? Kafka? Swift? Disney? But he does not one of these well enough.

Go watch 'Fear and Loathing,' and imagine this as inserted in that.

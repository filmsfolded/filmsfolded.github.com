Gosh, I was surprised at finding something clever. Yes, most of this is a stroll through a museum of obsolete 7th grade humor. This is so tame and lame that it blends into the background like so much graffiti. The "nudity" is goofy.

But there is a secondary spine in this that is really quite clever. You will surmise that the fiction here is that there is a world where sex is easy and gangs form based on vaginal territory. That notion, normally based on jocks versus nerds, is here contrasting imaginary sex and drinking boys with -- get this -- "little people." 

Its done as seriously as usual in these sorts of things: a sort of testosterone sibling rivalry. Its darn effective. There is a whole fraternity, a gang, of little men, complete with little women. They strut and pose just like the "regular" people. The effect is staggeringly funny, centering on a football game.

I am not sure whether the other I saw was the first or second. This is superior in having something with soul in addition to the formulaic love story.

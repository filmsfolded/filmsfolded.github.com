Spoilers herein.

I've been revisiting 'classic' films, and am amazed at how badly some come across. A few really do improve with age, but not this one.

Part of the problem is that film invents society. Both are constantly changing. This film got left behind because it uses a simple device to create tension, a device that is wholly obsolete now, even on TeeVee. Now we have a full visual grammar where the camera support the tension. In these bad old days, the tension was wholly dependent on simple face shots and grimaces. This was less than effective when Bullitt was new because McQueen was completely untalented as an actor.

The chase scene is obsolete too.

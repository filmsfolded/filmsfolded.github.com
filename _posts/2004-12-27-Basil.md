Yet another example that just plodding through a novel has little to do with making a tenable film. This one just thrashes through the story with nary a nod to cinematic necessities. 

But it does have Derek Jacobi, an actor with so much presence it almost makes the trip worthwhile. Derek knows how to create a character that is in two minds at once. That way we know we have something to recall when new information is revealed.

Everyone else seems to lack direction.

The original story had promise because of the revealing layers and plots. But it is all so drearily presented one hardly cares.

Spoilers herein.

How funny! At root, the Holmes stories are about introspective situation. They were written at a time (Darwin, Freud)when science was beginning a fifty year period as being something that people actually strove toward. They thought that they would be better if they incorporated a scientific approach - meaning in this case logical, introspective, aware - then life would be richer.

That's true, but the exceeding purity of deduction seems to be what has stuck to these stories by most moderns. They've lost the notion that Holmes was acutely situated in his environment.

That said, the 'Hound' was Doyle's most developed situation (merely because it was the longest story). The whole idea was to emphasize the bog, the isolation, the strange. Now, I don't need every Holmes to be Basil Rathbone, but the tone of this version is straight out of seventies pop culture. It is colorful and light and choppy in a trendy sort of way. Its not even aware of its own situation. What a disaster.

Incidentally, they did carry over from the older films the odd notion that Watson is a bumbling idiot instead of an observer less astute than the master. That, I suppose, is a tenet of old British film-making (the goof, usually a cop), but it never works for Holmes and is more out of place in this story.

Spoilers herein.

Danny DeVito is the Frank Zappa of Cinema. He makes meticulously crafted films, so finely designed that they really impress. These are fine products at the technical level with lots of cinematic tricks. They are also finely conceived in terms of the narrative placement. Heck, one of his films revolves around a Nabokov novel. But like Zappa, all that craft is deliberately hidden under an unappealing, inhuman noise.

In this case, its the narrative conception that makes this worth while. I say that even though I am dying to report that at long last Williams, poor man, has a role that fits.

That narrative structure relies on a currently popular device of plays about plays. Here, it is a film about an ice show about a TeeVee show. All three are equally abstract and stylized; all three an equal 'distance' from the viewer. But unlike Lynch or Depalma or Greenaway, the casual viewer has no problem sorting out which is which. That's because of the talented Keener and how DeVito uses her: as our surrogate. Walking through this, we have a fight over the TeeVee show in which a fighter in 'real life' is murdered.

We have essential nazis controlling the TeeVee show, disrupted by 'real' Nazis which are a threat to the player and which he turns around in the iceshow parody. (This is a nod to Brooks and his similarly structured 'The Producers.')

Watch this. It lacks the inviting warmth in which many films wrap themselves, in fact it pokes a stick right in that tradition. But it is intelligent in both cinematic and literate ways.

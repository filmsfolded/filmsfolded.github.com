One of the most exhilarating things is to see a remake or another version of a film where at least one of the films or the source book is excellent.

That way, when you see even a poor version, you recall in your mind the excellent one, plus perhaps a number of metanarratives about previous experiences. And the meta-meta about the relationships among them, each one a puzzle.

In this case, we have a remarkable book, truly tricky. We have no good film versions among the three I have seen. Lumet's is the most famous; it is entertaining, lush and has some rudimentary notion of the importance of the space. It also has the finest performance of Ingrid Bergman's career, just a few minutes, but truly remarkable.

But it was not good. The book depends on the arrangement of the cars, the compartments and the doors between. There's a spatial logic to the thing that the puzzle is based on, and Lumet ignores it completely. So too here. And of course, we don't have recognizable actors, and what we have aren't encouraged to perform to excess. They are simply there, and fewer than in the book. The number is significant.

So it is not particularly good mystery, but neither were the Finney (Lumet) and Suchet (Blue Train) versions. What's interesting here is how the thing is now set in the modern era. Actually in 2001 before 9-11. Some mechanics are modernized and the writer somehow thought computer technology could do the job alone. 

The big change is in Poirot. He isn't an officious penguin, He isn't obsessed with the mechanics of evil. And -- surely the most interesting -- he isn't celibate and in fact is involved with an incredibly sexy woman. Her scenes are the most well done and effective, actually, and the notion is so shocking that it jars the whole metastructure we balance on top of this production.

She's a not quite reformed jewel thief. At the end, it is obvious that the two as lovers and codetectives were to be a team in further adventures. These never happened of course. But its a great idea: old and young, both geniuses, he emotionally inept but cerebral and she emotionally damaged (a prior murder) and overflowing with an understanding of how life works.

I would have watched it.

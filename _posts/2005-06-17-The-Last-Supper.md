Superficially this is a political movie, and to judge from the comments here, lots of viewers think it is proliberal. What a gas, even though there's a terrific speech at the end about the influence of media as constructed politics.

Take it as politics if you wish, but there's another story here.

Any film is another battle between actors and writers, They stand on opposite sides of a huge philosophical divide, no matter how moderate their utterances. Actors truly believe -- they have to -- that all life comes from the living and all a writer can do is slice or sculpt a bit small enough to consume and large enough to attract.

Writers believe -- at least in their hearts -- that everything is created, that weaving a world takes work. Actors are puppets brought in at the very last moment to provide air to inflate the balloon. Yes, you humor, even encourage them, but relatively speaking they are mere tokens. 

In this case, we have the writing moved from outside the movie to on-screen. Our gang of five graduate students become the determiners of what happens, who lives and dies, Our guests are actors, literally dumb yobbos who (except for the last guest) grasp a role and play it because that's what they are given.

Virtually no one has a political opinion determined rationally, we are all actors, victims of what is written. That's the point here. As the story goes, there are twelve deaths (counting the girl and the cop) to align roughly with twelve apostles present at the last supper. 

The thirteenth presence at that meal was the Great Actor. So actors win this round, as they always will in politics and religion.

This movie isn't as dumb as you think. That's the point.

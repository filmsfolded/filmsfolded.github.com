Spoilers herein.

These things are usually about the story you don't see while you are distracted by the noise.  This movie is rather ordinary except for the cosmology. Superficially it is ordinary: Nazis, the  devil (with attendant evil forces and magical mechanisms), technological magic, some 'Ilsa  the She-Devil,' and a conflicted hero who 'remembers' an evil past. But there was some  novelty in how these were combined this time: no books, no special icon or place. Just ether.

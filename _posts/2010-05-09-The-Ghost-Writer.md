I've taken a long time to form a comment after seeing this film. I think it deserves as much depth as the makers put into it. 

If it is the last film that Polanski is allowed to make, it will be worthy of him, and the way he has taught us to glance aside to catch the devil that walks beside us and sometimes speaks for us.

The story could not be better, both pulled from reality and from genre. The genre bits have allpowerful agents, Blackwater-like paramilitary and chases. Death. The real bits have lying politicians who needlessly kill by the million and spend by the trillion. There is marital and writerly deception. All of it is posing; most of it twists as if that were necessary for us to think our money well spent.

Polanksi spends a lot of energy here as always making the place be as complicated as the people in the place. We meet the place first. We understand it first because we know the place, the world, matters and the people are merely like the leaves that the old gardener puts up over and over. The people don't matter in the sense of having will. They only matter in terms of what they can reach and damage.

Ewan McGregor started his career understanding this sort of film-making, film-making where the making matters. The tone is everything; the story is just there for color. I think that at some point we will be calling him the new model of (male) actor, after the Brando generation (Penn, Depp). You have to convey that you know that the viewer knows you are acting and why.

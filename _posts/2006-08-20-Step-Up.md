Something funny about movies. Different genres carry different expectations. Dance movies for me prompt the lowest. I don't care how trite the story or incompetent the writing and acting. I just don't care as long as the dancing is good.

In fact in a way its better for the dancing if there aren't a lot of other aspirations. AFter "Tango" and "Red Shoes," I don't need more elaborate folding of the show within the show. But the dancing had better be good.

And by that I mean it not only has to be good as dance, but it has to be cinematic. There are only three ways to accomplish that that I know. Oddly, though the director is a well known film choreographer, she seems to know none of them.

The way you expect in a ghetto-meets-whitebread story is in the raw energy, the sheer power of unpracticed but expert physical expression. Not here. The whole thing is not only validated by a slick production number at the end, but we see all the practice of that same.

No energy. No impulse. No life.

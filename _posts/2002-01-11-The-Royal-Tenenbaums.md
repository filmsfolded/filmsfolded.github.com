Spoilers herein.

I probably should like this more than I do. I value filmmakers who do something unique in terms of narrative placement, who enlist their actors to the same end they see (a rare thing), and who cleverly employ self-reference. But the tone is too flat for me, and the mechanics too visibly artificial. But those mechanics are expertly engineered:

1). Engineered Self-referential Irony. the creating duo on this film want to make flat, simple comic-book episodes. As literally designs on royal playing cards. That's a matter of design. In recognition of this, they decide to make their approach a specific part of the film: Margot's plays are a mirror of what this is: kids in animal costumes with no character development. She has a dry period (actually wet, in a bathtub) and then after the action of this film, writes it as a play, which is presumably what we see.

Richie, who has always loved her, also wishes to be an artist. We see his art: it is also representative of the film's deliberate style: sketchy, minimal, 'folk art.' This is the same art that illustrates the book we see that titles episodes. In other words, the film is Margot's words and Richie's pictures. The actual writers tell us this is their style.

2). Engineered Casting. This is filmmaking in the Altman/PT Anderson tradition, but not as skillful. In this philosophy, you sketch a story thinly and let your actors find their characters and chemistry. It is all in the casting. And I must admire the skill with which this cast is engineered. Hackman is a type of actor that finds all his characters within himself. Which makes him 'natural,' but has the undesired effect of always showing the same avuncular dope. All the men actors are of this internal type. They are always letting you know that they are acting, sometimes winking.

The women! Angelica Huston is one of the most intelligent actress working. She is not a glamourgirl so doesn't get many roles. But she so far outclasses Hackman, it is the source of an in joke. I have no doubt that Hackman has no clue, and probably wouldn't care if he knew he was being goofed on.

Gwyneth is growing as a real actress -- not like any of these guys -- someone who reaches outside for someone and adapts her soul. In this, you can visibly see her taking Huston's lead. This was a very clever choice which pays off well in the one central scene: after the suicide attempt in the tent with Richie. She's the writer, its clear.

I saw Gwyneth do something similar in "Duets," a similar unconstrained situation. Its what you come up with when the director is weak that really shows who you are. She may become someone that matters. We can hope.

And the narrator! This fantasy is of the type pioneered for the masses by Tim Burton. So we get it framed by the Beetlejuice guy.

3). Engineered Music. Here's the most skilled part of the construction: All the music is old, from the 60s-70s. Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Morrison. Including a really cool insertion: the 'Pat Garrett' theme, 'Knocking on Heaven's Door.' One song from 'Satanic Majesty's.' This stuff is from such a far away era (I hate to say) that it adds to the pretend nature of the skit.

Spoilers herein.

Two Murphy's: one talented and human in the larger, good sense; the other a ghetto humor mugger. The two war with each other. When the ghetto Murphy wins, we get minstrel humor and flatulence. When the human Murphy wins, we get real funny stuff. The kind of laugh that is on ourselves instead of some other folks.

Eddie Murphy is a talented guy. This is a humorless project. End of story.

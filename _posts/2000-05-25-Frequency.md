How far we've come! In the old days a final plot twist was a surprise, with the best being a surprise insight. Remember 'No Way Out?' More recently we've had end twist insights that reinterpret the movie. In that case, what you learn at the end has you going over the whole film as you leave, wondering about which of your prior understandings need to be modified: 'Sixth Sense,' and 'Usual Suspects' come to mind.

But in those cases, the film is a story apart from your perception of it. Here now we have a story where your reinvention of what you know changes the story from the perspective of both you the viewer and the hero in the film. And it doesn't just happen at the end, but all through the last half. A new high in self-reference and experimentation with the role of the viewer in the narrative.

Worth seeing for this step in the evolution of the art.

Spoilers herein.

I like constructions like this:

-- Folding of narrative between what is written and the story of its writing

-- Folding of time, where moments are shuffled

-- Actors acting as actors: in this case Branagh sitting quiet while others act as his avatars

-- Lots and lots of supporting constructive symmetries: the woman without a child and the woman who doesn't want a child; the 'real' Peter and his dopple; the 'real' Peter and his actor; a director who directs by performing; impotence and writer's block, others.

-- Lots of intelligent wordplay including word symmetries. The most obvious of these is the symmetry of the neighbor's cur (dog) who dies, and Peter's curmudgeon (who also dies). This kind of play is deftly introduced in dialog between the two Peters, comically peppered by Branagh saying 'I got nothing out of that,' after a fusilade from the other.

-- All supported by good actors. In this case our top Shakespearean, and the wife of our top film actor. These people know how to collaborate so to keep the words suspended in front of us while flowing faster than normal and syncopated oddly.

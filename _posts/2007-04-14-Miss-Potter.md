Writing about film has brought me to other writers. Most I don't like, especially those along the Ebert line. But he has one rule worth considering. A film should be judged with others of its ilk only, he says. So a teen slasher exploitation film shouldn't be trashed, because it is pales in comparison to an art film. I think Ebert does this because of the simple economics of selling papers, and I don't worry about that. There's a rather warm argument that can be made though along the lines of democracy, though I think what a reader usually wants is an honest opinion from someone whose values they find interesting.

Either way, as a Ted snob, or as a celebrant of diversity, I liked this movie. I wasn't prepared to. Zellweger's acting by mouthscrunching is annoying, and I just haven't liked many movies that take themselves seriously without what most folks call irony. But this has folding in an honest and simple manner. The device that is used is Potter's, the mix of nature and character. Its a romantic notion of the time. Today, our blunt manners would call it cute, but there was a deeper vein of romantic philosophy in the world then: post-science and to some degree anti-science. Fundamentalists play that role today, including fundamentalist naturalists (nee environmentalists). 

Anyway, Potter mixed the notion of human character with animals, and in a way where they really stood for nature. So the thing starts with a fold. On top of that we have a story about a storyteller. There are some romantic plot wheels that turn, a love, a death, a mother, a friend. All of these are cast in the manner of a Potter story. And sure enough, they two actually overlap cinematically as her drawings often "come alive."

Similarly, the countryside is photographed so romantically I yearned to be there, fully believing that my mere presence in such surroundings would change my world to one of simple passions and purities.

And yes, Renee does her shallow thing, creating a character that couldn't possibly be real. But that's entirely appropriate, in fact the goal, yes?

McGregor gets it too. I really like the choices he makes. He's been in some of my favorite films, you know.

I only saw one funny thing and I wish it were deliberate. At the beginning, our heroine takes a brisk ride through the park. The park obviously is populated by characters from the era. One of these behind the gate on the left as she enters the park, was he cardboard? I want to believe so.

For what it is, it works. So I get to follow Ebert's rule. But it works because it folds into itself as a Potter book, so it satisfies Ted's rule too. Whether you want a dip into chocolate worlds is up to you.

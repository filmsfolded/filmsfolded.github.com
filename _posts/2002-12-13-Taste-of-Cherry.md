Spoilers herein.

This film separates cinefiles like few others. Some think it subtle, even subversive -- perfectly personal and worthy of reflection. I think it poetic, but bad poetry. (The filmmaker swears that he does not want special appreciation because he comes from a repressive society.)

It's one long setup for a payoff at the end, where the layer of dreamcreation is revealed. It's a sophomoric turn, unless you impute more Pinteresque depth than is really there.

'Saint James' Infirmary' at the end. If there were some hint of metanarrative, some ghost, some 'War is Over' distance, it would have worked.

Gilberto Perez champions this work as a matter of inhabiting film as if it were an alternative, accessible world -- one perhaps of refugees. This is underscored by the lack of 'acting' in the film: in fact, whenever two men are apparently in the car, they are filmed separately -- it is said -- to prevent them from collaboratively acting. But the champions go on to place Kiarostami after Godard and Bresson.

You may agree with them, but there is a difference I think between inventing a subversion and adopting one.

At least this film has the quality that it makes you examine important notions of film before you reject (or embrace) it.

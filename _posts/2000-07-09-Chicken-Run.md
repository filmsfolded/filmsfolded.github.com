I haven't anything to add about the story proper. It is competent enough, though I suppose you need to know 'The Great Escape.' The British loss of WWII is now complete, as we transform German prison guards into Welsh chicken farmers.

More interesting to me is what this film may mean for stop-action films. Not so long ago, filmmaker had two choices, something had to be real, or it had to be drawn. But the drawing was real too. Now, the advanced of computer-generated techniques is so great that soon it will be cheaper to make a computer-generated film than by any other technique. We'll still have the others, but only because of nostalgia. There'll be a demand for old-fashioned Disney-type films because we remember that world fondly. Will there be a demand for claymation (or something that looks like it)?

This film and what theses guys make next will probably determine that future.

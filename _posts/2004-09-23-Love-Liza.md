Spoilers herein.

I have only a handful of living male actors that interest me, far fewer than the similar list of actresses. Hoffman is in that group, not because he is an intense and skilled actor, but because he understands the larger shape of cinema and how to integrate with it.

Many viewers will see this and really think the story matters. Or that it is an opportunity for an actor to create a deep character, as directed by another actor. Well, yes; those things matter, but they are not where the magic is designed.

The point of this experiment is to integrate the space created by the actor with that created by the filmmaker. This is all about dimension and is so successful it belongs on everyone's best list.

The character is an aircraft CAD (computer aided design) designer, someone who creates 3-d models of airplanes that only exist in the computer - at least initially. For those who have never experienced this, doing CAD work can be magically transporting: you can be quite literally transported to another world where you have some control and presence. Creating CAD models is not at all unlike acting, at least the kind Hoffman does. At the beginning, his geek friends are talking about entering the model from another direction.

Every shot is framed by the director to be dimensional, even when it contradicts film-school blocking templates. In every such shot, Hoffman seems to be aware of the artificial world he is inhabiting/creating and adjusts his gestures and presence. He doesn't just accommodate, he aggressively helps create.

He has to take a job as a web designer (using 'racer' computers). Just as the actor has to be engaged in a 'story.'

The story obliges the metaphor; he literally gets involved with model airplanes, real ones. He gets involved with huffing, which I am told affects visual perception first, primarily dimension. Watch the clever folding of the actor who creates dimension and the character who simultaneously deprecates it.

... an unopened message.

Oh, don't under any circumstances listen to the DVD commentary.

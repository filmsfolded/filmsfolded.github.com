These sorts of projects always have two kinds of jokes.

This first kind is the mere reference of other films. Its a natural idea, since the genres that are the target are always about other movies anyway. The meat of the joke is how many films are used and how they are shown to be so similar.

The second kind is the ordinary sort, gags that are supposed to make us chuckle, quite apart from the referential humor. Over time, these jokes have become more puerile, as we've moved from the Zuckers to the Waylons to these guys. You know, I can tolerate a lot on that front, so long as the backbone of the thing is rich. 

Actually, this is. Enough so that I will watch the next one, even though I'd prefer the decoration to be intelligent. I fondly remember Leslie Neilson's elaborate setup in "Airplane" which ended in "ham on white and hold the Mayo." And so far as references to films, my favorite approach is oblique, like the second "Charlie's Angels."

What's interesting to me is the two women here. One is the reliable Jennifer Coolidge, who with Parker Posey is the way Christopher Guest penetrates into our ordinary films. Her comedy always references outside worlds. She anchors this.

The other woman plays a stupid teen. She's a redhead. Her character's running joke is that she repeats what the other girl says. I have a minor study in redheads in film. Its the most reliable quantum states in film. She's not a talented actress, not an actress at all. It doesn't matter because she likely has been exposed to these personalities all her life. Its the one thing that saves the superficial jokes. Writers know this redhead rule.

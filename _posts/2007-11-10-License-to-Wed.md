This movie isn't worth commenting on, except for the unnecessary warning to stay away.

What is interesting is what bad choices Robin Williams is making. Its entirely possible that his mania for performing has transformed into an addiction that is fed by a drumming routine. Its an odd twist of market forces that talents are not encouraged to preserve what makes them special. And when we talk about movies, we always talk about market forces as the great story that overlays all other narrative we see.

He made his reputation as being the new Jonathan Winters, someone probably mad, but in a way that amuses. His multiple personalities, sprung tight into methamphetamine-like wars of words and twitches. He's transformed that into a brand: we know what he really is, so it matters when we see him "do dramatic."

I've seen him in very few films worth watching and only one where he was not only perfect for the role, but supported the ambitious agenda of the project. "Popeye." Its a great film, and he was a good actor in it. Other than that, because he is so strong in his standup, I think we will remember him as a comedian like Bob Hope (with many of the same sensibilities) who incidentally made a lot of movies.

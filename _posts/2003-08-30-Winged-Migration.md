Spoilers herein.

A few things to celebrate here, and more to be concerned with. The item to celebrate is  obvious: we have taken another step towards freeing the camera. This camera takes us  places we haven't gone before. Ever, and the new dimension --  flight -- is one we very  much need. That's quite a statement.

Normally when I encounter an experience like this, all other flaws are overlooked. But  they are pretty significant here. They all revolve around the nature of the cinematic  experience. It should be enough for us to see natural beauty in a way never before seen.  Why then is this unnatural tendency to drama? What we have here are dozens of little  stories. Will the birds escape the avalanche? Will the bird with mesh return? The editing is  cleverly sculpted to take us away from the beauty and into the story. It is a shame we  demand this. It is an even bigger shame that such a grand project would succumb. 

I have chosen to live in what could be the world's most heavily travelled migratory path.  So I know it is a further shame that this project focuses almost exclusively on large  waterfowl. I think it had much to do with technical matters. Too bad, because the coolest  migrations are the groups of thousands of smaller birds that build a collective  intelligence. This is shown once, incidentally, in the background of a small flock of larger  birds on the water.

Few places show the miracles of grace combined with collective intelligence as well as  these flocks. One of those images is worth thousands of poor birds trapped in sludge.  Ho hum. In fact, the miracle doesn't stop there. On board these birds are thousands of  types of parasites and - yes - avian viruses, the source of most of our flu. How these  agents move about and fight for life is a cool, even beautiful, story as well.

Jarring moments: the French narrator (who is also the producer) affecting a bogus accent  as if to stick his Frenchness in our eye as a matter of pride. The gratuitous shots of the  bald eagle and Amazonian parrots, worse: the exotic bird escaping the bad old men. The  music, which is good enough to fit the tone of the minidramas, and underscores the  anthropomorphic intent. But it tends toward a faux, lowbrow inspirational tone. Made me  feel dirty.

If you happen to be alive and watching films in the late 60s, you'd be immersed in a period richer than anything we have seen since, I think. People just seemed more receptive to fundamental reinvention where today its assurance we need.

There are lots of obvious examples of this. Here's a much less obvious one, and it may be hard to see why.

Superficially it is a slight project, a slim entertainment in a common form: a genre film that references the established notions of western justice that has in the standard interstices a story of racial justice earned. (You have to imagine that in those days it was commonly accepted that the black "man" had -- by dint of intense perseverance -- finally achieved a place at the table. Also, you have to place yourself in a place where the western was still taken seriously and without irony as the zone where American values were handled, reaffirmed.)

Its not obvious today, because notions of race have since shifted. But this was a fairly radical film in its time: more so say than "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," or "Lilies of the Field." The idea of weaving these two notions of justice together was pretty radical, and extremely ennobling. It was a special event then. Today, its old candy.

And that's the power of this, knowing what it was and seeing how tepid the "message" is. Today, we're as likely to see the whore with the golden heart as mattering.

In the thirties, before noir was invented but after talkies arrived, there was an amazing period of experimentation, especially in the mystery. It wasn't settled enough to have conventions yet, except that the bad guy was usually brought to justice.

The pre-genre, pre-noir era is the most interesting in film history, so I'll see any mystery from this period, no questions asked.

The experiment this time has a wisecracking forensic scientist, complete with lab (and lots of visible paraphernalia), lab coat, and beautiful young woman assistant who he secretly loves.

She becomes a love pawn of the criminal, but that's not very interesting. What is interesting is how we experiment with the original notion, the Sherlock Holmes notion of the detective as a scientist. Profound deductions, tenacious curiosity, state of the art (for then) instruments.

Its important. This guy is not getting beat senseless by mobsters. He isn't chasing tight sweaters. He isn't a master of disguise. He doesn't "investigate" in the Hardy Boys manner of stupidly putting yourself in a vacant house with the killer without anyone knowing.

He's just a guy in white coat, discovering the cause of things and wondering how to tell the woman he loves that he does. This finally comes with him writing on a slide for her to "discover" through a telescope.

Its good, the film-making too.

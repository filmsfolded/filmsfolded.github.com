Spoilers herein.

I am so disappointed.

I thought the book was too blunt in its use of the language, but I did appreciate the clever construction. It is a story with great exaggeration, which contains a writer who must use great exaggeration in his stories. Much of the exposition explains why, and draws the reader into the space between the cartoon that is the book and the cartoon that is the newscolumn without us noticing that we are goofing on ourselves.

The template for the mechanism is the first such superreal novel: 'Cannery Row.' This is copied even down to the destructive party. Except here, the humor was from a different locale, superficially a minor transposition. But there was even self-reference in that treatment of the locale: studied treatment on the immoveability of place: including deep use of local language, the business of the restrained house, and the extended metaphor of the oil tankers

So when I heard of the cast, I had great hopes. Cate and Julianne are the two living actresses capable of projecting just this kind of self-reference.

But what a mess Hallstrom has made! This is the 'Harry Potter' school of filmmaking where a book is reduced to the episodes therein and they are marched before us without any sense of the world from which they project. A collection of thin banalities and cute platitudes are substituted, as with his last film.

In fact, not a shred of originality or art is allowed to creep in, from the 'Prince of Tides' first shot to the obligatory and ordinary helicopter ending. All of the self-reference is lost, except the thin device of Spacey giving some headlines to his life. Nearly all the local peculiarities have been ironed out, even the accents. We are left with a few rugged crags instead. As an example, consider the moving house. I have recently seen three other films with moving buildings, the remarkable 'Oscar and Lucinda' (where Cate was allowed to do her rare stuff), 'The Widow of St Pierre,' which wasn't novel but lovely, and the underrated 'The Claim.' In each case, the filmmaker stretched for visual effect. Lasse is tired, derivative, unartful.

This man really is a menace. His license to make films should be revoked.

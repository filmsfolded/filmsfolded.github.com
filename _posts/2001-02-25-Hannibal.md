Spoilers herein.

Demme made a great film the first time around. He used talented actors to project a feeling of evil and defilement, primarily sexual. His film supported the actors.

Scott has greater ambitions -- he is the star, and the magic here is in the filmmaking rather than the acting, even though this crew of actors is even better than the last go round, Normally actors are asked to play to each other, the audience or the writing. Scott asks them to play to the fabric of images he is weaving. This means that the primary characters -- if sufficiently talented -- can project past their lines, a projection that persists from scene to scene. Crowe did it in 'Gladiator,' and treasure Moore does here.

Scott's coconspirator in this is Mamet who is the most intelligent screenwriter alive. Mamet doesn't have the chops to direct in this manner himself, but this team is unbeatable. This new investure in texture allows Scott to take the movie in a different, richer direction than the first film. Here, the seduction is of fine taste -- understandable extremes in the quest for ultimate quality. 

Lector is not so evil here, but a man of taste and intelligence, one who plays by his own rules and who doesn't shy from repellant exotica. This is supported by the brilliant exploitation of Florence and in fact all things Italian as far as their maniacal commitment to taste. So rich.

In the original, Lector inherited the sexual perversity of the parallel story, and hence became an evil beyond. In this version, the real evil is in the rich and powerful -- the demented millionaire and the crooked government officials. In this case, the focus of evil is moved from Lector -- he even takes revenge on the bad guys.

The result is much creepier than the first film could ever be, because you are seduced into understanding Lector. And that's damned frightening. In the last few months, I saw Mamet ('State and Main') and had complaints about his lack of virtuosic camera, and saw Scott ('Gladiator') and wished for writing as good as the vision. Here we have it.

Only two comments about the actors. Hopkins is ruined. 'Titus' did it, and in fact he pledged to quit films after that. He was asked to do something multidimensional and couldn't deliver. (Something Jessica Lange did handily in that film, and which Ms Moore is known for.) Here he is weak. It doesn't matter so much until the end scenes, but then it is clear that there's not much left in there.

Julianne isn't asked to carry the film, but there is one place where she and Scott could have done better. Lector remarks on her jogging after having observed her. 'I traveled far to see you run.' But when she was running, it was about the deadest part of the film, made so by lush work before and after. This one scene they could have made the center of the film. (Think of "Run Lola Run.") They decided to move the center to Union Station instead. So they should have changed that pivotal line to evoke the chase sequence.

Spoilers herein.

It is easy for to evaluate musicals. The songs count for very little with me. I can find good music lots of places. The story is usually just an excuse to move things along, rarely interesting (except with 'Pygmalian').

No, what matters for me is the staging and motion. If it is imaginative (as with 'Wizard of Oz'), or very polished ('Guys and Dolls') so much the better. But it has to have dance. Dancing characters, dancing situations and ideally a dancing camera.

Well this has one of three. And not much of it. But that barnraising sequence makes it one of the best filmed dance sequences of all time. Unfortunately, the camera is stodgy, mechanical. Probably this is because of the very low budget and requirement to shoot twice (once not in Cinemascope). But it still has energy! Gymnastic of course, but look at the choreography -- the movement of the dancers amongst each other is ordinary until you get to the fight scenes. But the movement of each dancer is quite radical: for instance, the dance competition is all focused on the knees. I have never seen that before or since. I think Kid decided to do whatever he wanted.

That one scene makes up for the sex with sheep joke, the cheezy backdrops and the violent misogyngy.

There's a story within the story: a blunt mirroring of the rape of the Sabine.

Watch for Zelda of lesbian Dobie Gillis fame. She's Dorcas' little sister, on camera for only a few seconds when Dorcas is kidnapped as the lights go out. One wonders what these women talked about on the set. You have Julie Newmar and Ruta Lee (with their old names); the 'making of' feature on the DVD shows them as studiously vacuous.

Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

Spoilers herein.

It is impossible these days to make a movie about high schoolers without it being self- referential. Usually the self-reference is in the actors acting as characters who are acting  roles which in turn come from movies. Teens call this cool.

This one is only a bit more clever, being more fingernail than finger. The writer (Tina Fey)  appears as a character. What she has written about her characters revolves around what they  have written about each other. The critics seem to think the comic machinery is well done,  but the interesting thing is the experiment in yet another type of folding.

Since Molly Ringwald, it has been hard to make a teen folding movie without a redhead in  there somewhere. This time it is Lindsay Lohan, from whom we only ask what we did in her  other folded deal (the body-swapping movie): act like a guileless kid, then move into  complex strategies with furrowed brow.

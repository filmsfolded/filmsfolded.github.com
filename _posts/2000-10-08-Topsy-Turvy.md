Gilbert and Sullivan were known for productions that had no sense of pacing, were overlong and had cartoon characters. Thus, it makes sense that an immersive study would have the same characteristics.

This is from the same filmmaker as "Secrets and Lies" a film of very light touch and sensitive probing of emotions. So one must assume that this film is dull and depressing on purpose, as a statement of art. I mean this seriously.

But it may be that the point was supposed to contrast the pure pleasure of the productions with the tragic, desperate lives of the many people who produced it. However, the scenes from the "operettas" aren't that much fun, and this is from someone who is very easy to please.

The best scene was Gilbert's father's fit. Had absolutely nothing to do with the story, being just plopped down in isolation, but was fascinating. I could have imagined a stronger film centered on the characters of Spall and the leading lady, Shirley Henderson. Did she do her own singing?

This is not art. It is not rewarding. We deserve better from a fine filmmaker.

Spoilers herein.

A small drama, lots of contrasts. Cruel jokes, innocent deaths.

Greek: a language designed for three people to speak over each other: the story told by  the filmmaker of the writer; the implied story told by the writer, and the stories  confabulated by the villagers and imposed on their peers. These three struggle for  control over what is real, at least what we see as real. In the end, the differences are not  clear -- who do we carry in our boat?

Clue: the last scene is remarkably similar in staging to that of the later "Swept Away."

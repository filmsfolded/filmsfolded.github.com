I am in the midst of watching a lot of Laurel and Hardy shorts. I'm amazed at a few things. 

There are over a hundred. They all use the same gag philosophy, often the same gags. And they range from pretty darn funny to boring.

This is one of the boring ones. You know when you see a tray of sandwiches that it will be upset and the tray will be used as a weapon a few times. You know when you see a bandaged foot that it can only repeatedly pummeled. Sometimes they do these things with a pace and lightness that you get swept up in it.

Other times, as here, you can imagine them as tired, coming to work to hear the day's layout and just not caring.

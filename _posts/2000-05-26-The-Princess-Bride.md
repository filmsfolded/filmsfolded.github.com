Since visiting IMDB, I've been prompted to think about my favorite movies. I have a short list of films that are particularly clever in one of the cinematic arts. But I have two that strike me as perfectly entertaining stories. This is one.

Oh, the other values of filmmaking are fine here, but what makes this stand out is excellence in the simple art of storytelling. Also as I enjoy self-reference, I like the frame of the grandfather telling the story to a sick child.

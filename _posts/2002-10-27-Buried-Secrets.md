Spoilers herein.

Normally, I would trash a project like this. It is of a type so wholly unoriginal, they grate, they offend. But I must admit I was impressed by the sheer competence of this. It is that strange mixture that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the surprise deviation from the formula. And the longer it takes, the greater the tension. The longer it goes on and the more clear it becomes that they know what they are doing, the tension builds and builds. What could the twist be? What hint did I miss that they will surprise me with?

Greater and greater the anticipation swells until... it ends by following the formula by every jot and tittle, leaving you with a 90 minute tease. I suppose they could have crammed in a dog.

Spoilers herein.

Prague is home to a school of animation that is worth monitoring for what it might mean for the future of film. The visual imagination is clever, but hardly unique. What makes this worth watching is the peculiar philosophy behind the art. These folks believe in social commentary, in political art. I personally have trouble with this motivation. Preaching is preaching regardless of how silk the pew. And in the case of Svankmejer, that moralizing is particularly blunt.

But here we have a new player on the scene. Still simple notions of social dynamics -- at least in this student project. But the message and the manner of presentation are much more cleverly interwoven than with Svankmejer. Here, the 'message' is still offensively trite, but the presentation is so pleasant we sit through it without complaint.

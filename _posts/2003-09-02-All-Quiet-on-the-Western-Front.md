Spoilers herein.

These things fascinate me: films that are about something but are presented in a way  that contradicts that something.

Often it is a film whose message is to strive for the extraordinary, but the film itself is  strictly formulaic. Here we have something much more interesting and profound: we  have the future of film. We have - not quite independently - the future of the world.  And along the way, we have the war film as a key factor in defining the national  character.

Even in 1930, the vocabulary of film was still in its infancy. Griffith (and many others)  had already frozen the template as stage drama plus sweeping vistas that one could only  get on screen. The two alternated: first you would see the lavish, grand scope. Then you  would zoom in on some small personal drama, sculpted and dramatized as if it were a  stage play. Like, say, the encounter with the dying Frenchman in the crater, or the  counterpiece in this project: the two classroom speeches.

This was a very bad thing. Very bad for our imagination as a society. Instead of the new  medium taking us to new places (and yes, a new moral perspective) we remained trapped  in Victoriam morality plays. We stick there even today. Much has been made of the use of  some of Eisenstein's techniques. But he was highly individualistic, very personal - even  iconoclastic. Tarkovsky's films appear radically different but were in this independent  spirit. Both were non-stage derived, non-moralistic.

Here we have what we would later call a Hollywood film: grand, slick, moralistic  (headsmackingly so) and thoroughly mundane in its dramatic sequences. It is, one could  say, a militaristic film with a non-militaristic message. I dare say that this type of drag on  the collective spirit of the people is as much a curse as any war and indeed a straight line  can be drawn from this type of film (yes, even this very film) and the cinematic  techniques used by the Nazis to codify and communicate

nationality.

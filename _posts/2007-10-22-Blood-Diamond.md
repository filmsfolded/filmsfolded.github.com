I watch movies from the 30s set in Africa and cringe. There's a racist/colonialist attitude in nearly every one that overwhelms whatever other merits the thing might have. It embarrasses and troubles me to no end because I wonder about what it means to be complicit.

My grandson will look at this movie here and think much the same, I believe. By then its very likely that the internet will have evolved into something where single voices can matter more, and he will wonder where I was in this. I'll tell him now.

This is a sad thing. Its basic form is as a manufactured product made by financiers with the intent of increasing their wealth. That's fine, common, normal, healthy even. But what it uses is the grief of a continent. Never mind that it was created by that very act. What's repellent is that it pretends to "educate," to champion action to mitigate their plight.

But the story is from the 30s. The person who matters, who makes change is a white man. There is a blackie who ends up being celebrated, but by then we know that all he has is commitment to his family. Its an admirable trait by itself, but everything else this man has is given to him by a white man. Sure, the white man is redeemed at the end is a sort of way, but even that is compromised.

You may think I am over-reacting, that surely ANY publicity of the plight is a plus, and there IS a pitch to boycott conflict diamonds. I simply ask you to look at old movies like this, and ask yourself: did you enjoy this? Did you buy the story, which means that you bought the characters and their roles? Did you buy into this world, pay money, enjoy and accept it? Will you be able to look your grandchildren in the eye?

We'll never escape this situation until we escape the world we create to live in.

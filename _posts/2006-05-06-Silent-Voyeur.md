I watched this together with "Mirrormask." That had great cinematic values, moderately acceptable performances and an inadequate story. This is the obverse, with a great story idea and poor cinematic execution.

I saw this fellow's earlier project, ambitious in many ways. You had to pay attention, but though it masqueraded as a zombie movie, it had higher harmonics in the ambiguities. Here, that same guy writes, acts, and directs.

It is as a writer that he may have a stellar future. There are inadequacies in the other elements here that cannot be merely explained by budget. But as a writer.

This story. Well, I'm the first to write a comment on this, so I cannot discuss the story in any detail because I don't want to spoil it. It starts as a "Rashomon" - like tale, where several versions of the past are "witnessed" to a man with amnesia about why they ended up in a remote cabin in such a strange situation.

(Never mind that everyone's story involves a video made earlier that could easily have been consulted.)

What's cool about the story is stuff that am attracted to: all the stories he is told involve the making of a film, a film of a diabolical type.

There's a surprise which comes too early for my taste, but it is a very clever twist. And there is a zinger at the end, which I think could have benefited from a great deal more ambiguity about which version of the story the filmmaker at the end believes was true.

I love this stuff. This isn't quite the untrusted narrator business; the trust issue is all pushed on screen, but there are enough clever elements here that I think we can expect something good from this guy soon.

{The best dialog is lifted from Romeo and Juliet, Act 1, scene 4.)

I recently started re-viewing films with an eye toward earnest evaluation, as much for self-examination as anything. By selecting this film, I wanted to find something special. So it is with regret that I post a negative comment amidst a field of glowing praise. I can only think that the difference is that tastes have changed -- more, the bar has been raised. And that's sufficiently interesting to report. Why doesn't this movie work for me, and probably would have 35 years ago? (In fact, I think it did!)

What we have here is good acting by Howard and Gold Hat, a book as source with an adventurous theme for the time, and clear but not artistic cinematography. By today's standards, the sets are cheesy, Bogart's acting isn't real, and the story is scattered.

About Bogart's acting. This was right before Brando (and many since) changed our expectations of the art forever. I never lost the awareness that the lines were written (they were just too clean) and that Bogart was acting. His affect was never real. Imagine Harvey Keitel, or even Tony Hopkins in the role, and you'll see what I mean. We've evolved a completely different standard of acting. We seek more immediacy to the emotional bone, more intimacy with the soul. For that matter, look at the 'modern' acting of John Huston in 'Chinatown,' to see how thoroughly even he changed his ideas about acting.

About the story, can you imagine a scriptwriter today spending so much energy on events which neither advance the story nor increase definition of the characters? The real story setup is the 'prisoner's dilemma' where what's best for an individual in a group trumps the best interests of the group (and hence all its members). Fairness fights paranoia. The lengthy prologue of being cheated could have -- with work -- supported this setup. But it doesn't! So many things could have been mutually supporting (like the letter to the wife, the rescue from the mine that wasn't really a rescue). But the standard of the era didn't require this. So the story appears scattered, unconnected to a contemporary audience.

I believe that the film continues to be ranked high based on rememberance that it DID work when new, that it WAS important in its time, and that we wish to honor a past that has passed. Oh, that and the 'stinkin' badges.'

A classic is timeless. This film is not.

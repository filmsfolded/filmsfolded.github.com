Sometimes a film is worth it just because of an accident. In this case the accident is that the Germans (not the Nazis, the Germans) had decimated large parts of London, and we had that as a set for this little drama.

Its a great little story too, perfect for this very successful notion of noir light.

Its the old fold: writer writes and the fictional becomes real. The only concession to reality -- which incidentally allows it to be inserted into the noir world -- is that what the writer writes is tampered with on the way to the book.

One scene toward the beginning is particularly nice, where a boy reading a comic sees the same thing in reality. I recommend "How to Murder Your Wife" as a much better entry in this minigenre. But this is good too. At least the first half. The second half (after the great, really great sewer scene) is a sort of noir Bowery Boys gets their man.

Love as a meme wants to endure. It does so by presenting itself as the only thing that endures without being a meme.

This dynamic is so powerful it drives many of our stories and for most of us, our whole lives. But when it comes to storytelling, it has to stay fresh to retain its power. How to make a fresh love story. How?

This film is built simply: build a story on the fantasy on the meme, anchor it with a few key images and surround it with some structural explanation.

If you have not seen this, the spine of the thing is that a six year old girl encounters her future husband. She fantasizes about him all her life, meets him in a library (this was originally a book) where she teaches him the fantasy. They marry happily, until he dies but the love endures thereafter, powered by the story in the fantasy.

The girl is presented with powers: a beautiful redhead in a sunny clean meadow having a picnic by herself -- apparently for her stuffed animals, but there seems to be openness in opportunity and hopefulness of purpose. A nude man appears, and they make a pact to meet thereafter, but the timing will be unpredictable. The sun in the red hair is a cinematic staple.

We later see the drawings and diary of this fantasy sustained. Notably, Rachael McAdams is photographed "realistically," as is the daughter of the union who ends our story by visiting the same field in picnic. The key image we leave with is the adult running across this field, alerted by the girl that the man has appeared for a moment. These field-images are what makes the movie. It worked for me. It worked.

The little girl-wife has her husband taken away, killed in a hunting accident during one of the man's frequent re-appearances at the picnic site. The unknowing killer? Her loutish father, who is introduced economically as "republican."

The story that surrounds has only two elements: the love itself and the attempts to have a child. There is a child, the girl in the filed at the end of the film. Alba wants to be born. She is the embodiment of the love with agency. We learn that she has the time traveling gift. Unlike her unhappy father who is a prisoner to his emotions, she can control the travel. She is in and out of the womb, which the lovers see as tragic miscarriages. 

She survives. I'm told that the book indicates the "fold" that she is the writer of the thing, the carrier of the meme.

The original girl is named Clair, translucent. The embodied girl is named Alba, white.

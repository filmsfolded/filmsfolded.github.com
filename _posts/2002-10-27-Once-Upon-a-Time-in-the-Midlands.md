Spoilers herein.

Shirley Henderson must be one of the most appealing domestic types in filmdom. Finn Atkins is the perfect daughter, extending the appeal in exactly the same direction. They are certainly pleasant to watch.

But beyond that, this project has no charm whatever. The Brits did not invent this simple form: a few characters made colorful in a few charming episodes tied together with some faux drama. But they have mastered the subtype where all the color comes from a new comic fabulism. In some forms, like Ritchie, there's appeal in just watching the frenzy.

But in this form, its just junk food. We need something more than the merely pleasant.

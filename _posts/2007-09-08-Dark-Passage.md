I am a fan of noir. I do think Bogart was used well in a few fine films. Moreover, there are some amazing films experiences I have had with the POV camera.

Independent of these two, I have fond regard for stories that are situated among "little people" trampled by the system. This specifically and pointedly does this. 

But this is a failure all around. You can't have noir (at least at this period) and also have human conspiracies. They're two different notions of who is pulling levers. But beyond that, even if this profound mistake hadn't been made, the simple storytelling here is broken. 

One dynamic in storytelling is the simple craft of telling us not what we need to know to move the story ahead, but what we want to. These wants can be manipulated, even mostly fabricated by all sorts of tricks, but you do have to put narrative fragments where our minds are directed. This director (who co-wrote this) hasn't a clue. We see things that get in the way. We see things we already know or don't care about. We see things that pander. There's one sequence where presumably the hero is under some psychotropic anesthetic and hallucinates faces in precisely the manner that symmetric lens mirrors can display. Its "horror" that works against itself. Its horrible, embarrassing.

Nothing works. The point of view at the beginning isn't for cinematic effect, rather to avoid showing the face. Its clumsy. The threads of desire that draw the two characters together are spoken about, but we just do not see them. So they aren't there. There are supposed to be underlying conspiracies and threats, but none are well drawn.

Shucks, this is turning into an ordinary comment. Here's something interesting: there's a long tradition of actors playing characters who are acting. One branch on the tree of this tradition is characters with new faces or bodies. Normally, we get some self-referential comment about acting that sometimes is a special event. There's none of that here, none. Its as if the new face was simply a disguise, not a confusing new persona. A good actor would see this opportunity and fill it regardless of the cluenesses of the director.

Watching Bacall and Bogart fumble about with their lines, shows you just how profoundly weak and inflexible they are outside their "box."

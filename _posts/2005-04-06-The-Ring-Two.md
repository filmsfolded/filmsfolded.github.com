By now you already know that the first one (whichever you count) was very good and this one is not.

I think I know why. But first let me describe a hobby of mine. I'm particularly attracted to minigenre: sets of sequels like the Alien films for instance or remakes or copies. I learn more about film by looking at these than any other exercise. That's because the differences are slight but obvious. For instance "Eat Drink Man Woman" is excellent but the same script as "Tortilla Soup" was a disaster.

No film in recent memory provides more fodder than "Ringu." There's the original of course, then the US remake, two Japanese sequels and a prequel, this US sequel, and two US copies "Grudge" and Boogeyman."

Each of these uses the same trick, sometimes in different forms: the thing that haunts is related to the medium you are engaged in by merely watching. As long as you watch, there is no escape. The original does this in spades. Successive versions are weaker because they necessarily add more story. And it is not story that we need, it is the attention to the form of the story. More story content weakens the form.

In this particular case, the story literally breaks the form: the evil is no longer constrained to the film within the film. The result is, well, a broken ring.

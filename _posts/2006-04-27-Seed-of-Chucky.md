Just because a movie is targeted at kids, involves cheap sex jokes, reaches for the lowest in gore and revels in dumbness doesn't mean its stupid. Because kids, no matter how hard they fight it, aren't stupid.

No foolin', I watched this in concert with " Généalogies d'un crime," about as highbrow as you can get and the films are remarkably similar. So remarkably, I suppose that some kids will read this comment and avoid the thing.

Look at the folded construction.

The Chucky franchise is its own genre of sorts and we go in expecting to see a movie about a movie. That's the nature of sequels, but this is number 5 and the notion is made explicit.

So we start with the making of the Chucky movie, with the dolls as animated puppets. Jennifer Tilly is the voice of one of the puppets and also a character in this film within the film.

The "child" of the two dolls (from the previous movie?) sees them on TeeVee and does a layered identity voyage in the fashion of "Nurse Betty" to join them. Once there, the dolls 'come alive" and the two movies and "real life" overlap and merge.

Its the oldest trick in narrative, originally designed to fold the audience into what they see so that the horror will be closer. But here it is all done as a joke, which effectively adds another layer.

Will the jokes be enough to make it worth viewing for you? I doubt it, even though there are many good ones in the manner of "South Park." John Waters is a photographer that shoots the sexy folds and gets it. Photographer = filmmaker in these folded things, explicitly so in "Pecker."

The kid evokes Ed Wood (here played by a David Bowie-like voice and a Tim Burton face), who made horror movies that were similar constructed and now viewed for laughs. Tilly mentions "Bound" in the same way, the pattern for "Matrix" which mines much the same territory.

Produced by the same company that did "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."

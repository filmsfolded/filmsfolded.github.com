Spoilers herein.

Some movie ideas spring naturally, either from the tides of society, an already successful project elsewhere or the talents of one or more of the players. But some are clearly engineered, a result of some roomful of analysts who have identified a need. A product is devised to fit.

In this case, we have marketing data that shows that a significant number of older men go to 'teen' sex/grossout films apparently because of the fantasy of reliving those days in a better way:  sexually carefree and without responsibilities. So here we have old guys literally moving into a teen movie. One guy gets to sleep with a classic, 16 year old pulchritude pie, but it is okay (we are told) because he really didn't know and his girlfriend is a slut anyway. One guy gets to dump his new wife, but that's okay because they weren't meant to be (he being carefree and all). But (here is the voice of the product engineers) the most cynical is the one that stays with his wife and kids in spite of clear, penalty-free opportunity.

No mistaking: this is for the "Men's Health" crowd, 40-50 year olds who wish they were 20. Note the name; note the really old guy who brackets the viewer demographic.

The situation is what sells (underscored by the REALLY old guy) not the specifics. In fact the specifics, by design, are supposed to be as calorie-free as your average teen movie. The only interesting adventure here is to note which of the three you find most funny and wonder why.

Vince Vaughn plays the ironic cynic, not fully committed to his cynicism; Wilson plays the cleverly ironic actor sometimes indicating a character; Ferrell plays it straight, Jerry Lewis goofy style. In my case, the anchor of the film is Vaughn, and his bits are what made me laugh, even when Ferrell was doing the moving.

Spoilers herein.

Cinematic life exists in a world that is large and intimate. Film can also thrill -- without much effort on the part of the viewer -- more than any other medium. Any other art can exceed it (TeeVee is not included in this) but only by dint of effort.

This tradition of summer films whose only purpose is to thrill is a strange phenomenon. Incidentally, it must put strange pressures on the filmmakers who want to surf that ever more lucrative wave. Thrill films are basically pornographic: the story exists as the barest excuse to cobble together the 'good parts.' Acting/reading is incidental. What matters is pace and intensity.

But sex pornography is pretty much always the same thing, and thrill porn must always top the previous standard. Nonetheless, there are only so many things to work with: fights, car chases, explosions, elaborate spaceships, monsters,

Egypt, outerspace, underwater are problematic because these types of film depend on familiarity: for instance an exploding space ship now has to look a certain way, quite contrary to reality, or it doesn't look real. Car wrecks must always flip and fly or explode or we don't believe it. You can press humor only so far, as Renny Harlin discovered in 'Cutthroat Island.'

Renny himself discovered the possibilities of mountain adventure with 'Cliffhanger.' Its novelty alone brought success, in spite of cheesy effects and the burden of Sly. Now 'Vertical' dips into the same pile, but with much better effect technology and more investment in a story of sorts. It is the same rescue bit, but with two side plots: the kid who sacrificed his dad to save his sister -- the climbing ace whose wife was killed by a climber to save that climber's life -- the confluence of those at the end when the ace kills the bad guy climber in identical circumstances, validating the son's decision (and incidentally again saving the sister).

There's some art in all these plotline symmetries, even to the presaging in the opening: 2 unrelated climbers disrupting a trio, and I appreciate this.

The effects are rather good as effect movies go: that opening sequence may become classic. But the pacing is dull and repetitive, outcomes and images predictable. One problem is that everyone is wrapped up in cold clothes, so much of range of the actors is off the table. Which is a problem because the director really wants the actors to add dramatic tension to the mix. Alas this group would be unable to do that in the best of circumstances.

The heaviest burden of this film is the existence of the IMAX film on Everest. That film depends (as do all IMAXen) on swooping heli shots over ridges, But it has grandeur and thrills this film can't come close to.

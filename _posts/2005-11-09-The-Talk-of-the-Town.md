Is this George Steven's most complex movie? Probably. But I think he attempts too much for his talents.

He does have extraordinary skills, but they are not in all the dramatic stuff that speaks to intensity and commitment and rhythm. What he does have is an extraordinary gift for staging and camera awareness.

But I think this one gets away from him and Cary Grant. Too many threads with not enough cinematic power to pull it off.

The one really great scene had nothing to do with the story. It involves a telegram delivery man on an erratic scooter. Great.

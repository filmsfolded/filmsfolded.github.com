Spoilers herein.

A terrific script, one which appears to be concerned with class imprisonment but is far  more clever. The key notion here is self-reference.

Vatel is a producer of lush entertainments, presented to us by -- a producer of lush  entertainments. Though only the translation is by Stoppard, this is the most Stoppardian  of notions: to amuse us with a story about people just as greedy as ourselves for  luxurious entertainment -- and to please while condemning.

The story goes farther into the truth: all entertainers are slaves, prostitutes. The game  for an artist is one of drawing lines between that slavery and the noble joys of creation.  Vatel does what he does because his obnoxious sponsors provide him the means to do  what he desires. That's all, or not all because he needs the applause.

Also in Stoppardian fashion, we have Roth (Guildenstern , Mitchel, Vincent) there to tell  us the terrible truth about ourselves. The plot involves competing attentions to Uma's  character -- essentially a sweet whore with canaries -- and Vatel, the grand coordinator  of revels. He is pulled by the King and his present employer as well as sexually by the  King's brother. He wins the admiration (and protection) of that brother in refusing his  advances by noting their common perversion in the quest for perfection.

How perfect for this film to be lacking the salt of engaging drama, that excuse we  normally give for watching. How perfect that we collectively reject it because it is merely  beautiful.

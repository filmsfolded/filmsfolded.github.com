Spoilers herein.

I had some interaction with Dick towards the end, well after the period of cynical  ambiguity of being whence came this story. By that time he had swung to the apposite  pole: optimistic being of ambiguity. Which is just the place to step outside his dual role  as world creator and noir-like puppet of that same creator.

Most folks just pay attention to the misanthropic futures and the dismal contexts against  which beleaguered characters joust. But the richness of his worlds is that any element  was swirled with its opposite, all the way down to the reliability of the cosmology.

This was true playground literature. Only the final 'Bladerunner' captures this ambiguity.  The more you watch it, the more clear it seems that it is not clear at all. All else do what  this dreary project does: pull out a plot as if it were the bones out of a fish, then throw  the fish away.

They miss all the richness of created fate. How far back does the reinvention and recall of  the past go? Surely we need to question whether the anything earlier than the first  injection is true. Possibly Uma is a created memory. By whom? Solaris? Valis?

Affleck is fully capable of destroying a picture with his dim being. But this disaster isn't  his fault. It was processed into a stupor-inducing machine long before it hit him. 

Dick would have chuckled and made some steaming comment that would have inspired  some weirdness in his next story.

Quite apart from that, why do movies assume that future machines will be an extension  of the goofy accidents we have now? That's as dumb as Star Wars troopers shooting  guns.

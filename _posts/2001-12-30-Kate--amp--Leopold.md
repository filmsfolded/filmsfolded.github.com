Spoilers herein.

I think this may have started out well. The main character was the Brooklyn/East River Bridge, a paragon of romance -- the wife secretly doing the engineering after the husband struck with the bends. (Actually, he couldn't have given the speech shown at the beginning for just this reason!)

Then, take that metaphor and extend it as 'reaching out,' 'forming connections.' Add in a few erection jokes, and the notion of 'elevation.' On this, mix in lots of self-reference to romance theater ('Breakfast at Tiffany's,' Pirates of Penzance'). Then structure the story around a woman who manipulates media and sees the light. 

I love self-reference of this kind. But it turned on itself and became more self-referential than intended. It announces why it is bad.

This is a film about not letting focus groups run your life, about being true. About not sticking to a vacuous formula. But it follows a vacuous formula itself. It was radically re-engineered from a finished version -- the original vision was transformed into this incoherent mess because the producers blindly followed, yes, a test audience! Incest don't you know. It must have been weird editing out the section in Meg's speech where she literally says you can't let focus groups run your life, compromise your values.

It about true love instead of superficial arrangements. But the 'true love' is Meg's preference for Jackman's self-rejected manner instead of JJ's even more false sophistication. And that 'true love' involves Meg's patented perky character, surely one of the most fabricated confections in modern film. Problem is: though her face has has been preserved through surgical maintenance, it is hard to love a forty year old loser as the girl next door. She has devolved to an almost carbon copy of a similarly aging Melanie Griffith.

(I think there should be a warning about any movie that has our cute-as-a-button heroine pump her elbows and yell 'yes!' after connecting with her dream date, and he has left. I've seen three such movies in the past week.)

The filmmakers should roast in hell for patronizingly telling us not to sell margarine that tastes like suet just for the money. And then do just that.

Spoilers herein.

In my so far over 1400 IMDB comments, I have maintained that the actor is often the one  least aware of what the cinematic effect is supposed to be. And that surely the form and  texture of the whole project needs to reside in one mind, usually the director. But  sometimes it is the writer who is the one who doesn't understand the intent of the film.

When that happens, it is the writer who provides the chicken wire that the filmmaker  spreads his plaster on to sculpt something worthwhile. That's what happens with Peter  Hedges usually. His last film ('About a Boy') was a particularly interesting case. He  layered on his sickly sweet sentimentality and Grant and the Weitz brothers destroyed it  by their comic pretension and cinematic excess. The result was fun, though I suppose  there were actually a few people who took it at face value.

Here we have Hedges unfiltered. Well, almost; some of his collaborators have done a  wonderful job in dressing Katie. She's an amazing character just from the stills.

But as the story unfolds, we have a jumble of stuff. Some of it is potentially powerful and  could have found a home in a real film. Other stuff, particularly the clumsy handling of  racial stereotype, makes you wonder if anyone really pays attention at all.

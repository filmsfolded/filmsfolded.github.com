Now we are seeing a wave of neo-noirish versions of detective, gangster and assassin movies. Metamovies about genres, and this type done for dramatic effect rather than comedy.

I love it, at least when it is novel as is this, "Brick" and "Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang." This time the filmic reference is a comic backdrop for what most folks call character development, but in this case is more definition than development because nothing changes.

Here's what we have: 1) the backdrop of the world as a movie. We only touch one character in that world, the assassin played by our Bond guy. 2) that guy who's personal dynamics are as cartoonish as that of the world he's from. The world isn't comic but he is. 

3) we have the designated watcher (Kinnear) from our world implanted in the movie world, using ordinary Hitchcockian noir dynamics. We sometimes have his wife as well, goggle-eyed with pleased amusement at the fun of it.

We of course are meant to be folded into the thing by equating us as watcher with the embedded watcher. It works.

Its a simple construction, but very, very effective, all of which is a long way of explaining why you'll laugh yourself silly.

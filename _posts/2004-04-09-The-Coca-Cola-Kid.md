If you know Dusan Makavejev's interesting 'Sweet Movie' you know he uses heavy metaphors and has a sexual thing about children. Here we have a sweet comedy with those elements.

The heavy metaphors are the standard obvious stuff, wrapped around a conventional boy- girl fantasy. The sexual fixation is apparent in the shower scene where the poor kid is shivering of the cold necessary for the 'fog' and the multiple takes.

The choice of Scacchi would have been great were it not for her own obsession with actually acting with her breasts. But otherwise, she has the perfect face and bearing for this appealing type of airhead. There's a scene that is very well conceived, with her in a Santa Claus suit that ripped off in a shower of feathers.

Could have been a good film in other hands. This try has lots of pieces that were tossed out, stuff about the husband, Mrs. Haversham and the animals.

I did like the notion of the girl's name and that she photocopied her face. These are much more sophisticated notions than Dusan can handle though.

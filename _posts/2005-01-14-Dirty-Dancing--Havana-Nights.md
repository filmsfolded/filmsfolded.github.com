If you came to this because you like movies about dance, forget it. It's mighty hard to have a good dance movie if the dancers aren't good. Moreover, the photographing of dance is one of the most challenging tasks in all movies; rarely is it done well, but when it is (usually with the camera as a dancer) it is sublime. The camera here is static, as if it were looking at a 1950's baseball game.

If you came looking for another heartwarming coming of age movie, forget that too. It's all but impossible to do a conventional one of those with unappealing teenagers. The little sister here has appeal, but not the leads.

The device they tried here was dance as sex (ordinary), dance as love (only works in South America in my experience) and the big one: dance as revolution. In no case do they make a convincing link, though any one would have sufficed.

Blooper department: these poor Cuban women of the late fifties shaved their armpits.

I suppose the secret weapon in this was supposed to be the conveyance to a Cuba of a different time, like "Before Night Falls." And this almost works. The production design is too busy, and it all looks like a set.

But there is one device that almost saved this movie for me and might for you: All movies are about other movies. In this case, the movie is about a memory which is about a movie. The movie starts by featuring our Americans (our surrogate viewers) arriving in Havana, busy with their movie camera. As the credits roll, and their camera is operated, we see the results: garish post cards. It is an intelligent acknowledgment of the movie within the movie introspection that is exploited a bit later.

You see, Mom and Dad were champion dancers, who we see a few times in home movies. At the point where our younger generation makes their commitment, they do so by dancing in front of the projector, so we see the dance movie literally on their bodies. It is a terrific, intelligent and cinematic ally dynamic moment in an otherwise formulaic drudge of a project.

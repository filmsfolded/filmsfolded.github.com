Its all artificial, every movie, every story. What we see and allow along these lines is a matter of negotiation between us and the artists.

But sometimes what we see is so clearly an inferior copy of what has gone before, we just cannot accept it. No negotiation, no cajoling will push it past the line of what we can accept. The best it can do is recall earlier, happier experiences.

What we have is here is an old mix. Its motivated by wartime-inspired honor. It uses Philip Marlowe-based language and detective situations. And it pretends to be noir according to how noir conflates liquid fate with love of a woman. But on each thread of this confused braid, its weak.

There mere appearance of Bogart isn't enough. Actually, he made only a few fine movies and a few tolerable ones. 

There's the average Joe beset by unlikely circumstances which turn him into a detective. There's the girl who is so magnetic one can't help falling in love, but she's "trouble." There's the mobster who predictably manages his empire from a cinematically appealing "club." There are the inept policemen with whom everyone toys.

You can make a genre film that is robust, that is not a clich√©. Genres provide lubrication, shorthand that sets context and rules for the viewer as part of that aforementioned negotiation. On that skeleton, a talented filmmaker will construct a body for us to inhabit.

This, this is a skeleton, a plastic skeleton.

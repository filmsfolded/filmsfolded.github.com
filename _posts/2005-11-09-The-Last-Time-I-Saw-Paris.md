Sometimes a movie tries too hard. It enters a space so minimally theatrical that what you see is nothing but what advances the melodramatic drive to tragedy.

I don't mind this a bit. But here, it is too cloying. Van Johnson just doesn't have the chops for this. The women do, and there are undercurrents they lay that probably aren't in the script. 

The idea is attractive. The situation is too. The characters of the family work. 

Especially useful is the business about Liz's image being created by herself in the caf√©, and then literally on the wall by an artist.

But Van and overall heaviness ruin this

This was one of those subsidized movies that the US used to convince the world that Paris was a romantic city. A Marshall Plan thing.

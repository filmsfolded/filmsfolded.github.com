Storytelling is not a simple affair. Unless all you want to do is fill space, it is not enough to just take one or two (usually two) characters and draw them as they draw their situations. I know that some matchbook writer schools say to do just that, but our imaginations need more to get engaged.

I do not know the book from which this originates, but I am rather sure that it didn't take the storytelling shortcuts we see in the movie. In fact, I think we can reconstruct the book's backbone from artifacts we have left, strewn throughout the movie.

We have a bookish father, a rather serious scholar who is trapped in a menial job, probably in a book-related enterprise. We can infer as well that his Jewishness is what sets the barrier to advancement and produces the later termination and suicide. We have a decidedly non- bookish son, it seems someone actually dull. So instead of the father passing wisdom from his books to the son, we have a disconnect.

The son is the narrator, more precisely the narrator is tied to the son's vision. Because that vision is broken, the narrator is untrusted, and we see two versions of a story after the piggybank affair: one in which he remains poor and another in which he lives a fantasy with a prostitute.

That untrusted nature pervades the story itself: there is a story about an older son, someone whose existence even the shopkeeper acknowledges. We in fact see a photo of two children. But in a remarkable scene, the mother returns and the boy presents his own, contrary, story while she speaks similarly.

So at root, it is a book about books: The "Jewish" (and western) books don't connect. In fact, they are sold to procure sex. The Koran does connect, and much is made of our boy's receiving and adopting it. It connects not because if its intrinsic content, but because a human (a "sufi" shopkeeper) created the bond. Along the way, we see our otherwise poor student become a master teacher when helping pass the driver's test.

So we'd have a book about warring books, connecting with the reader through personal metaphor just as the story within connects the personal through books. I call this "folding," and imagine it to have been the construction of the original book. 

But none of that is here. All of it has been washed away and replaced with actor's mannerisms, disconnected scenarios and cheap sentiment. Sharif should have known better, especially if he understood the story.

Spoilers herein.

Some genres are cinematically pure: somehow they fell or evolved into a form that leverages film in some special way. And the other way around -- they just couldn't exist without what film has to offer. The best example to my mind is the vampire film. The form is a lot of useless gabble with people moving about setting up situations, and then you have a few, very few, powerful images. Those images are what matters, all else is forgiven, actually forgotten. Those few moments matter.

In the vampire genre, as with a few others, it is all about archetypes. These have to be clear, deep, singular. Sex, dreams, anxiety. Self, blood and death. Vampires in film are strongly self-referential: the vampire is from another world and enters the world of the story as a performer, just like all the other actors enter the film. That world-with-the-film helps to clarify the archetypes. Its why 'Shadow of the Vampire' is so powerful. Its why these vampires are in show business, as were Banderes' ones in 'Interview.'

Anne Rice's idea was to map these archetypes into soap opera stereotypes. She has had some success with this strategy in selling books. But in the film version of those books, the filmmakers went back to the original film-vampire vision. These characters are not real like she intended, somewhat like Stan Lee made Peter Parker. No, these are good, old fashioned, pure archetypes. And it works, at least for me. Not the skinny strutting males, but these glorious women. The filmmakers knew what they were doing. There is a bunch of to and fro to satisfy the fans of the books -- this stuff is absolutely dreadful, at the level of John Carpenter's excrescences. But the whole thing is built around clever powerful images of Jesse, Akasha, and Maharet. These are played by striking women to begin with.

--Lena Olin has been a sexual sorceress before. Her roles  in 'Unbearable Lightness,' and 'Ninth Gate' stick in my mind and few actresses do. She has in fact herself built some of that film archetype that she fills here.

--Aaliyah has the lithe, cool sensuality of the second of the three basic types. (These are from Carl Jung.) It depends on and exploits elements of race we would be better off without, but she does do it well. If she hadn't died, I suspect she would have faded anyway because there just isn't much call for this sort of thing. (Remember the similarly striking Jaye Davidson?)

--The third type doesn't require much, just to be a reasonably attractive redhead. Why a redhead I do not know just now, but that's the way it is. Moreau did this type well enough in 'Firestarter 2' and does so here satisfactorily. Alicia Witt might have been better.

That last scene with the three keeps this out of the toilet for me.

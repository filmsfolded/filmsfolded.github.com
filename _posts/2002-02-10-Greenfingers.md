Spoilers herein.

Oh those Brits! 

Some film helps define culture but all films reflect it. Often the game is not so much in inventing something new to say, but in moving old insights around to satisfy a market. Here, the film leverages two of the three societal affects that Brits use to define themselves.

The one that is left off is the notion of 'teatime,' a deeply colonial notion, that allowed every lowly citizen in small groups to be plugged directly (and orally) into slave labor deep in the empire.

The two that are melded here are gardens and prisons. The English garden is a strange beast reflecting the notion that man can control nature. It is a product of the overlay of deterministic, mechanistic Victorian science on daily life. Every garden needed to impose an order that nature could not, and thereby create a modern 'beauty.' A radical idea in its time that seems ordinary today.

Not unrelated is the British notion of prison. Oddly, no nation has imprisoned so many in so many different ways. But at the same time, the English have always been the most advanced thinkers in the humane movement of prison management. The notion is not unlike that behind the gardens, and for the same reasons. But instead of mapping on top of agricultural nobility, it applies over the societal obligation. The Brits invented the notion that prisons can be remedial rather than merely punitive, even in the 'hardest' cases.

So we have someone who thought that a film about (a real event concerning) gardeners in prison would resonate. Note in this that the prison warden is a humanist -- also that although the 'wild' garden didn't win the contest because it was insufficiently formal, it did win so far as the Queen was concerned.

When I watch films like this, I find it much more fun to construct the motivation and recreate myself as the target audience. That way, you can get behind the stupid, vulgar moralizing and watch the dynamic of a culture freezing or reinventing itself.

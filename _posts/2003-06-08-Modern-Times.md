Spoilers herein.

Here's a strange opinion: I think 'City Lights' is one of the best and most important films ever made. It will always be required viewing for cineliteracy. This one is superficially similar, but not nearly as enjoyable or novel.

Yes, the factory sets are well architected to participate in Chaplin's ballet. Yes, the then current Mrs Chaplin has an aggressive feline sensuality. Yes, Charlie's energetic approach and commitment is admirable. Yes, this is highly visual, especially compared to the word gags of the Marxes. But too many elements have become already formulaic.

In 'City,' there was a clear dependency of concept, clear to us as viewer but built into the story as well: 

- we knew that at root this was a coherent statement coming from one mind rather than the common case, films designed by committee.

- we knew that the goal was to amuse us in the tradition of the British stage: fun at all costs using clever extensions of extremely familiar notions and techniques. The world of abstractions into which we agreeable enter was known beforehand and part of the amusement; how they are bent is part of the amusement.

- clearly subservient to all this was the creation of the character in a context of social situations. 

The relative importance of those was important: 'City' was intended as a creative endeavor whose success depended on a collaboration between him and what we brought. But look what has happened to 'Modern.' The situation: the Tramp, the technology  and personal context of the movie, social injustice all have taken on lives of their own and become additional participants in the contract. No longer can we 'let our guard down' and participate. Now we have to worry about how to receive the 'message' of the movie.

In this project, the hierarchy is all reversed. There is an element of overt social commentary, something that would become even more evident with the Hitler film. But there it is so bold and imaginative it is admirable in its own right.

There is also the elevation of the familiar over the novel. There is no innovation here, in fact the whole idea is to emphasize the familiar. He himself is guilty of the same mechanical thinking he criticizes.

That's the strange thing for me: the same recipe in two films with the slightest variation on emphasis: one is transcendental, the other amusingly troubled.

There are two kinds of films worth watching. The first, which I prefer, attempts to do something intelligent, often failing -- but the failures are interesting and noble. The second worthy kind are films that attempt something simple, but execute perfectly. The first of these is literate and lasting, like poetry -- the second, less intellectual, appeals directly, and temporally to the senses, like good food.

Here we have the second case. This movie is extremely well crafted, and part of that first class crafting is to remark on this complementary nature of poetry and food in the two characters. This film is serious in relentlessly, seamlessly focusing all elements on the simple effect it attempts, and is so polished it takes my breath away. Compare this film to "Theory of Flight."

Heck, compare Gere here to his trite outing in "Runaway Bride." And Winona charms and glows as brightly as Audrey Hepburn in her prime -- this after the dreadful "Girl, Interrupted," or the even worse "Looking for Richard." Someone put a lot of attention into burnishing this product. I wish I knew the story of how it was made. I do not know Joan Chen's work, but I'll be looking for her in the future.

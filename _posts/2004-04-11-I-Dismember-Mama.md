Spoilers herein.

Horrible production values in every respect except for the idea behind the script. I collect  films that are based on Alice in Wonderland. This is one.

The little girl is the typical Alice since the Disney version: long blond hair, light blue  dress, white knee socks. Her identity shifting is the same as the books; in this case, the  Red Queen (here the redhead) is named Alice who dies and is replaced by Alice. 

(As it happens, this little girl goes on to play a similar role in the Brady Bunch with a  similar Alice.)

They do the train thing and the boat thing more or less from the books. Then they end  up in a warehouse of mannequins and mannequin parts that incongruously also features  pictures of nude kids at the beach in from of which our monster stands.

This is stolen from Kubrick's 'Killer's Kiss' which in turn was inspired by Wells' 'Lady  from Shanghai.'

There was a fairly intelligent idea here. Just botched, that's all.

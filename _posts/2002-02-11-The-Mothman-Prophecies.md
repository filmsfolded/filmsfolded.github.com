Spoilers herein.

I love it when this happens -- when the presentation of the film matches the content and tone of the story.

The actual story is slight, but it is given texture by the fact that so much is unexplained, there's more that just doesn't make sense. Rather than a weakness, it adds texture to the mystery. Because we are not supposed to know. And so it is with Gere's character: he has moments where some part is lucid to him, but most is not. Some of his deductions are wrong, but in general, his moments of knowledge are mere islands in a sea of confusion

And so also with us the viewer, and here is the good part. Pellington has really come into his own as a master of the camera. What he has done is give us moments of visual clarity in a sea of confusing movement in which we can't make sense. The visual method of the story reflects the content of the story.

Great, just great.

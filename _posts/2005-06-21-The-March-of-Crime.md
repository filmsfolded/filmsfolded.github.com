These exploitation fillers depend on the public's fascination with deviance and violence. 

In this case -- and unlike the "second edition" -- the lurid and exploitive is wrapped in a fake narrative, just like Nabokov's introduction to "Lolita," which he said he copied from stuff like this.

The wrapper is: "Parents, there are hidden tendencies in your children, criminal tendencies. You must be on constant lookout for these and nip them in the bud. Your child can get swept up in the most repellent behavior, like THIS and THIS and THIS.

That is, unless you catch it. Oh, and did we say they could do THIS, so your young girls will turn out like THIS?

Since I am the first to comment on this, I'll note that it is much like "Reefer Madness" in tone: a warning to parents around a parade of stuff. That stuff is in part "dramatisations" of hangings, electrocutions, even crucification! There's a real hammy episode of a murderer being haunted in his cell with the specter of impending death (and guilt).

But the major part is the recounting of real crimes with as many film clips as they could find. There's a more blatant use of this material in the sequel.

I came to this for two reasons, both of these reasons were people.

The director made one of the best "Hamlets." This is a non-trivial achievement. It was not particularly adventuresome visually, but it really worked for me. How in the world he turned Julia Stiles into an effective Cordelia is a wonderful mystery. Bill Murray turned inside out. Wow.

The lead actress here blew me away in "Wings of the Dove," and does every time I see it.

The effect of this on me was unexpected. It is not generally liked, because not much transformative happens. Christopher Walken has a small role in the middle is oddly bad. If you think of it as a genre film, it simply fails because it touches the bases from unexpected but uninteresting directions and sometimes not at all.

But I liked some elements of the story. Nominally it is a "Curse of the Mummy" sort of thing. 

However, you can approach this as a "Naked Lunch" sort of thing. We have the guy who is the writer. He and his wife are substance abusers of a high degree. Her name is Nora, a name that carries huge associations from James Joyce. Predictably, his name is Jim. Together they booze into an alternative story, in Ireland of course, situating deep in the bog.

Its about sex, magic and story. Each of James and Nora has a doppelganger. In Jim's case it is his son, also Jim who is our designated observer. In Nora's case, it is a magical being with hypnotic sexual powers. Much is made of the relationship between this sort of addictive sex and creation. Natch.

The guide through this wonderland is a newly pubescent girl named Alice. There are characters that surround these, but they are there only to explain things to us. Walken's character has the most overt and ridiculous lines.

So you can see that the shape is pretty well imagined. And in fact it maps almost directly to the sort of thinking used to reimagine an film Hamlet as a film student. But that shape is wasted on what in all other respects is a bad movie. Nora here is not redheaded except in the most sexually charged scenes where a red light is used.

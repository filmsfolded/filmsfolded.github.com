Because this is a TeeVee show (and produced by Oliver Stone) it is blunt. We are meant to get riled about the injustice of the thing. I did of course. Since the McMartin debacle, we had a similar trial near me, the Little Rascals scandal. Religious nuts came and briefed the local police on a global satanic society that performed ritual sacrifice and predictably shortly thereafter there were 429 charges of satanic abuse involving 20 adults and 90 kids.

These included (seriously) infanticide, kidnapping by spaceship, torture by trained sharks and the accused included the local sheriff and mayor (who of course weren't charged). This movie glosses over the energy for the whole phenomenon that came from religious nuts who believe in devilworship.

And inexplicably, it omits one of the funniest parts. Outraged parents were convinced of the secret devil-tunnels under the McMartin school so descended on it illegally to dig for them, so as to "expose" the conspiracy (which they thought the police were covering up!) and the satanic warren.

Anyway, under that is a conventional trial movie. We like these because its a natural setup for storytelling and the untrusted narrator. We can, in these, easily see two realities: the real reality and the fabricated one (or maybe two) created as the truth in the courtroom. Usually the difference between the two is interesting in some way.

As with the ordinary type, our lawyer is a scumbag who does something noble,

This goes further, and I appreciated it. The conventional trial form has only one spinner of an alternate reality. This one had several: the evil cops, actually reduced to evil women. The "media" who spun the thing into hysteria. And the parents who unwittingly victimized their kids in making their own fears real.

And finally we have the creator of false memories, played here by the underrated Lolita. 

That's a lot of fictionspinners in a story, so to keep it simple for TeeVee, they all reinforce each other in ever-expanding heights of the same fiction.

James Woods is a master of timing but oddly that isn't used here except in one scene where in court he shows a video of a child being interviewed by the false memory implanter. The child squeaks a toy indicating no when asked about the abuse. She squeaks, he indicates "no." Its a great scene in an otherwise forgettable movie. Too bad.

I like Peter Weir. I've liked him from the first I've seen of him, "Picnic at Hanging Rock." Original and haunting.

What he did there, he has done less powerfully and more conventionally, but it comes from a religion that I respect.

You see, you have choices about how you believe the world works. It doesn't even have to be the real world, because the worlds of narrative can be bigger, with cleaner more explicit dynamics. Weir's world is one in which the world drives the narrative and people just exist in it, more or less successfully. This is not a common world in film, what with the Italian character-centric, the Spanish fold-centric, and the overwhelming noir-centric models out there.

He's done some crap, some commercial crap, but he's largely stuck to his notion of the world that grinds on independent of will. This is, after "Picnic" his most atmospheric, and surely the one with the most exotic world movement. So its admirable on those scores, that it represents a rare cinematic religion, and that it does so with effective exotic authenticity.

But there is something creepy about this. Its by an Australian company. Aussies are an interesting people, largely European in origin but deliberately fresh in perspective. There's much made here about Gibson's character being fundamentally different (he thinks) from the stodgy imperial British military guy. Gibson quite literally steals the girl from this guy because of his Australianness. "The girl" here represents so much more than a single person coupling, and expansion that Weir's world allows. It isn't sex, but the seduction for control over the story.

(He, incidentally is a story-writer.)

But what's smarmy about this are the limits of Weir's own imperialism. True, he reports on the grinding conditions. True, he has a main character preachify about the nobility of helping in the small. But at the end, an unintendedly horrible, unsettling end, all the white folks simply leave safely. That by itself is okay, but the way it is celebrated as a victory, the victory of the couple, subordinates the chaos of the world to backdrop.

Now, if this were a more intelligent filmmaker, I would say that this was intended. A clever artist would use this device to trick us into being the imperialists and releasing it too late. But I think the truth here is more unsettling: he didn't see it at all.

I write this a few days after Australia threw out its thuggish administration, George Bush types who similarly couldn't see. I'll bet now, in Australia, the new, cleaner Australia, that ending would unsettle. Especially now that we know Gibson's mind.

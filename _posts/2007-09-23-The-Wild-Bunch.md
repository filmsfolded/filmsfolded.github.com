By this time, westerns had become a collection of icons, the mere flash of which evoked deep memories and stories. All you needed was some confidence, the skill all in the confidence. There's a selfreferential aspect to the hero we'd often see, as he would himself be a paragon of confidence in delivering our referenced vision.

This was thought to turn that on its head by having the avatar we share with the filmmaker be a bad guy. "Bonnie and Clyde" had played a similar game the year before, and in a genre with a similar mechanism. But the gangster picture was less richly iconic, the vocabulary relatively small, closed. "Butch Cassady" would come a few months later and turn the western into a refection of the present instead of past, foundation stories -- folding the "gang" into Sergeant Pepper. 

So when I watch this again, I do so looking at icons and watching how they've been tampered with. This comment addresses two.

One is the women. I seem to remember criticism at the time that this was misogynist, though its hard to see how it could have been deemed worse than its predecessors. Its mighty hard to beat "The Quiet Man" where John Wayne, after serial episodes of recreational drunken fighting, drags his selected but reluctant sweetie by the hair through cow pies.

In "Wild Bunch," the woman trigger everything. A woman is behind the chief crook's motivation, her death also causing a physical wound that haunts him. Another woman, the Mexican's girl friend, runs away with the murderer of his father. The encounter with her is what everything revolves around. A third woman, a presumably permanently alluring prostitute, is what causes the two best friends to be separated before the movie begins and one friend to hunt the other. Oh, there are armies and robberies and shootings, but these are embodiments of womenly encounters. It matters because by this time noir had permeated everything but the western. The only way to introduce it was obliquely, through a force that's offscreen, that western notion of romance that exists only at the demigod level.

The second thing to look for is the key shot, the one scene around which everything is built. The one shot that it is in the filmmaker's mind as he first wakes up and remembers the work. Sometimes the filmmaker tells you what it is. You may be fooled into thinking it is the shot in the beginning where scorpions are tortured by children. For me it comes 43 minutes into the director's cut. There are two outlaws in the gang that are also outlaws within the gang, more bad than the others. They are with a Mexican girl, a teen, and quite pretty. She is working a cat's cradle. If you don't know it, its a string game played with a loop by on or two pairs of hands. 

Its quite ancient and probably evolved alongside the development of spoken language. Its really quite hardwired in our brains and a solid model of cinemagraphic qualities can be built and shared using this "string figures" notation. Their encounter with this pre-sexual woman and this graphical node is the anchor shot for me. Your's will be different of course because each of us -- I hope -- builds the world differently. But if that 30 seconds was missing, this would be a different film for me.

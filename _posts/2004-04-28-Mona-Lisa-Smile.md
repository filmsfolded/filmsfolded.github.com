Spoilers herein.

Yet another movie that preaches not following a formula and then does just that. It  should be reviled just for that lack of courage.

And not only that, another movie about the sophistication of art (which has a few rather  artistic shots of its own) that presents that sophistication as unsophisticated. An insult to  any viewer.

Stars should be wary of appearing in vehicles like this where others can be compared to  them. Roberts and Dunst are completely overshadowed by Harden and Gyllenhaal. How  could the producers allow such a thing? Aren't people tired of Julia's three expressions?

As it happens, I experienced Wellesley in the sixties as one of the male targets (from a  local university) in their hunt. And I know well a recent graduate as well as a few others  through the years. Only the words have changed in the last forty years. All else is  essentially the same. Women are still victims of their own cages, though of course more  nuanced than depicted here.

Believe it or not, in 68, there was serious talk of merging MIT and Wellesley until the two  started trading students. You can imagine the shock on both sides and the instant  retreat.

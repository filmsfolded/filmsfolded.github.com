Spoilers herein.

When Paul Thomas Anderson was working on 'Boogie Nights,' this particular film is what he  had in mind. It is, in a way, the classic: filmed, has something of a story, the women aren't  jellied and shaved. In fact the real career boost here was Dorothy Le May's who is what today  might be a suicide girl.

It also captures something of the 70's where the distance between life and the story here  wasn't as great as what is produced now.

As well, it was written and produced by a husband/wife team which by accounts was a  conventional marriage.

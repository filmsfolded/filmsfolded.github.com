Weak story triggers, notable car crashes, profound folding.

But before we get to that.... I've been watching WW II war movies from the 40s and 50s.

What a change from a plot premise that by any logical measure (here embodied by that movie staple, the supercomputer) the president and his collaborators need to be removed because of violations of The Geneva Convention. It is now post-Bush when I write this, but it was designed and made while Cheney was in power and the war crimes were slowly becoming known. Regardless of what you believe about this, the fact that this has elevated to stock movie device is so radical that it bears notice. Spock condemns torture.

But of course this is a tedg comment and so you will know that what interests him is the advance in the science of narrative folding. Narrative folding is, tedg posits in many cases, built on the device of noir, where an average dude is caught up in events that can only be explained as invented for the narrative necessities of engagement with us. 

We become gods in the movie, participants in a disembodied sense.

Here we become more literally embodied as a character who manipulates our two (really one) characters. Its always a guy and a girl who don't know each other but through the adventure fall in love. There's even a quote from North By Northwest, with an armed Predator (here correctly called a Reaper) substituting for the crop duster. 

It amazes me how Hollywood these days always portrays a supercomputer as a giant space (usually a sphere) of blinking lights into which humans go to be awed. Surely we need a better visual grammar for advanced concepts made powerful.

Interesting car crashes after the "Transformers" pattern.

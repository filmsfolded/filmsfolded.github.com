Spoilers herein.

The subject here is a natural sensitive who finds a layer of beauty in unexpected cracks in reality. The harder the reality, and the more unexpected niches he makes, the more sweetly surprising are the nuggets he places.

But this is not a great writer, not someone who can compose. He is an artist of snippets.

Now along comes Schnable, a man of similar sensibilities. He is also a man with no patience for shaping the whole. He reacts locally. But he has lots of talented friends. So what we end up with is a pot luck. Overall it is respectful, and in places it has local beauty. I knew something of Schnable, so avoided this for a while: he has found a market for an artistic philosophy based on attention deficit disorder and that's just not good enough for me.

But this has Penn and Depp (Depp in two proximate roles) and any project with them is worth the investment. Depp smuggles the book out of prison in his rectum. If you know their own lives in art, you can see them presented here with no directorial filter whatsoever.

Two really annoying things: the two most beautiful gems in this film are shots of the water and a remarkable balloon trip. The former is stoled from Greenaway ('Water Wrackets') and the latter directly lifted from Tarkovsky ('Andre Rublev'). This is not simple quoting. This is not fair use of a vocabulary. This is theft and is indicative of the general lack of artistic vision in this project.

The DVD has a tour of Schnable's loft where he pontificates on his pieces of frozen performance art from a more confused and artistically hungry era: 'Here is where I had tea with M- and slapped the teasoaked tablecloth against the canvas.' 'Here is where I dragged the canvas behind a jeep.'

This is for the Hallmark set which thinks it is hip because its small proverbs center on revolution, gayness and aids.

Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.

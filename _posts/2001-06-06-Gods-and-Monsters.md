Spoilers herein.

Another film about film. I love this stuff: self-reference is the stuff of real image manipulation. And nearly all films reference others anyway -- only related to reality through the filter of past images.

Plus there is some very fine acting here -- acting of the simple kind where characters are defined and projected. McKellen is all over this -- Redgrave is a master -- but that's what we expect. My respect for Fraser as a serious actor has risen however.

This film is episodic, coming in spurts. The director's perspective is also episodic: Sex; Film; Imagination; Longing; Perversion; Alternative Realities; Pathological Remembrances; Creating Lives that Lack Perfection; Dying Having Lived; Dying Having Not Lived.

McKellen fills each level, but only one level at a time. That's the Shakespeare way, at least according to British dogma. So while the conception is highly intellectual, and the acting dear, it would have been better if we had a director and pivotal actor that understood how to do all this simultaneously. Like Penn and Nicholson in 'The Pledge.' Like, dare I say, Whale himself.

Here's a sign how weak the director is: each of the three leads uses a radically different acting style. Fraser is wholly physical and reactive; McKellen tries to control his environment with force; Redgrave plays not a character in this film, but a character in one of Whale's referenced films. These are all apt, but they are not coordinated.

Strangely, the DVD extras detract from the higher dimensions of the film. I guess they figure it is easier to talk about a film by presenting a simple 'explanation.'

Spoilers herein.

I've been writing IMDB comments for about a year and a half now. I started with an interest in exploring how directors deal with the uniqueness of their vision, especially when self-aware or self-referential. (Self-aware is when the film shows how it is made, like the obvious effects in 'Beetlejuice.' Self-referential is when the film comments on itself, like when the story is about a filmmaker (or writer) who is worried about a technique that one can see in the film.)

Over time, I've become aware of what some directors call the actor problem. The public thinks of films first in terms of the people they see, the actors. And those actors drive the business. The problem is that actors have somewhat different goals than filmmakers, and often a strong actor will ruin the effect intended by a gifted director.

So I've been studying the various techniques and instances where each party succeeds in a solution that works. They are few, it seems.

Here is the ultimate solution: invent the actors. Shucks, invent their whole world. Invent their reason to be. 

Walt Disney shocked the whole system when he first did this. He created the actor, but not their world: Micky and later Donald and the others belong more or less in the ordinary world. However, the roadrunner and coyote belong in different world, one where the emotional physics comes from the mind of the filmmaker. We come to know just how that world works. Both the actors and their world come from a single mind.

Now with claymation comes a particularly unique development: the actor is created, the world is created. But the camera and lighting is 'real,' and modern notions of camera movement are used, just as in a 'real' film. The technique is self-aware: one can see that the characters are clay, see the thumbprints.

And it works, largely because one man's mind can be coherently presented in the context of real movies.

'The Wrong Trousers' is the peak of this man's mind though. The first film was better in the sense of literally exploring the possibilities of another world and its physics. The claycraft was more primitive and appealing, but the story was weak and the actors hadn't really learned how to use their faces.

The film after this 'Shave,' necessarily involved many collaborators, which diluted the vision. And more people meant more costs which means lowered risks which means vanilla story. That ultimately led to the slightly clever but wholly mainstream 'Chicken Run.'

So this film is a peak of sorts. A couple things make it uniquely fine: the strong self-reference and the cinematic expression.

The 'Wallace' world is fully Hitchcockian here, moreso than before or after. Hitch's innovation was to advance the drama by making the camera act, in subliminal but powerful ways. Nick has studied and mastered this -- it is the real power of 'trousers.' The technique is as much a matter of the camera humor as anything else.

And the story is self-referential as well: the basic problem of the filmmaker is that each film cements the future of films that follow. There is a straitjacket of expectations from the viewer that you cannot escape. One example: if you have a spaceship battle, it must rumble and flash like the movies before or it will not seem real, though the actual behavior of such a battle could never really appear so.

All film -- down to the smallest detail -- is so constrained. It is something deeper than formula.

In his natural state, Wallace's 'clothing' is unconstrained, only the manner in which he has to put it on. So here we have Wallace dressed by mechanical means. That's the normal state, Nick and Wallace tinker with those mechanics to have fun.

But now comes the real challenge: how to put Wallace in a fully Hitchcock world with all the plot formula that entails. It is mostly mechanical, that. Well, in a self-referential way, you put Wallace in some automatic, mechanical pants, that literally walk him through the plot, that literally drag him through all the stuff you need to have a 'real' Hitchcock film. It's a brilliant notion, one that ranks as the most successful in the history of film.

But Nick is already creatively worn out or more likely compromised by the system. The torch passes to Pixar.
